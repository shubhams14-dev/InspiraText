        "text": "Photo by Josh Riemer on Unsplash\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!\n\nWe just wanted everyone to know how much we appreciate everyone and how thankful we are for all our readers and writers here. We wouldn\u2019t be anywhere without you, so thank you all for bringing informative, vulnerable, and important pieces that destigmatize mental illness and mental health.\n\nWithout further ado, here are ten of our top stories from last week, all of which were curated:\n\n\u201cJust as the capacity to love and inspire is universal so is the capacity to hate and discourage. Irrespective of gender, race, age or religion none of us are exempt from aggressive proclivities. Those who are narcissistically disordered, and accordingly repress deep seated feelings of inferiority with inflated delusions of grandeur and superiority, are more prone to aggression and violence. They infiltrate our interactions in myriad environments from home, work, school and the cyber world. Hence, bullying does not happen in isolation. Although there is a ringleader she looks to her minions to either sanction her cruelty or look the other way.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though the circumstances that brought me here were sad and challenging, I\u2019m grateful for how this program has changed my life for the better. I can\u2019t help but imagine what life would be like if everyone learned to accept their powerlessness over other people, prioritize their serenity, and take life one step at a time. We\u2019ll never know, but I\u2019d bet the world would be much happier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prospect of spending a horrible Christmas, locked in on a psychiatric unit, was one of the low points of my life. For weeks, the day room was festooned with cheesy decorations and a sorry pink aluminum tree. All of our \u201cactivity\u201d therapies revolved around the holidays. We baked and decorated cookies. We fashioned quick-drying clay into ornaments that turned out to be too heavy for the tree. Crappy Christmas carols were background torture. It was hard to get pissed off at the staff because they were making the best with what they had.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough I hate to admit it, even if my ex had never betrayed me, I still wouldn\u2019t have been happy. I had set him up for an impossible job \u2014 to define me and make me whole. If I cannot find peace and contentment within myself, how could anyone else do it for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a personal note, significant feelings of loss and sadness can still flare up from time to time. That\u2019s only natural; it\u2019s no reason for self-critique. No matter how resilient we purport to be, we are all emotionally vulnerable human beings. Besides, we aren\u2019t talking about some conceptual loss that we can just mechanically compartmentalize away \u2014 we are talking about the loss of our fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next six weeks will be hard as cases continue to explode and government leadership remains nonexistent. I can\u2019t control any of this. The only thing I can do is take deep breaths, remain vigilant when it comes to limiting exposure to the virus, and let lots of stuff go. I may always be a hypochondriac, but now that I recognize the beast, I\u2019m hopeful I\u2019ll be able to tame it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom anecdotal news reports and informal surveys, there is evidence that for some of us, this pandemic-imposed isolation is a boon rather than a trial. One study on mixed emotions showed that those with lower emotional stability (\u201cmoody\u201d personalities) are actually better at responding to uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day I wish in my heart and soul that I didn\u2019t have ME/CFS. Unfortunately, I do. It\u2019s a result of a virus I had; 10\u201312 percent of people who experience a serious infection go on to develop ME. I\u2019ve visualized life without CFS for over a year now; I can smell life without it, I can taste it. It\u2019s in the smell of the lavender fields that I can no longer run through. It\u2019s in the taste of the meals from my favorite restaurant that I can no longer walk to. It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue. It\u2019s in the potentialities; all the things I could be doing, as a twenty-four year-old, that I can\u2019t. I cannot cross the chasm between the potential and the reality. And that\u2019s nothing to do with manifestation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s cabin fever, redundancy, loss, or general Covid anxieties, this year has caused us to be exposed to more uncertainty than ever. Uncertainty creates unease and feelings of stress. Some of us may have taken this year as one to motivate \u2014 plan dream trips, and prepare and be inspired for what the future could bring. For the rest, it has caused us to become irrational, emotional, and reserved.\n\n\u201cTo be more self-compassionate is a task that can be tricky because we always want to push ourselves and do better. Without realising it, this can lead to us being self-critical which can have damaging consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s important to notice these times when we are harsh because we can easily turn it into self-compassion, which is linked to a better quality of life.\u201d\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!\n\n\u2014 Ryan, Juliette, Marie, and Meredith",

        "text": "Your Brain On Coronavirus\n\nA guide to the curious and troubling impact of the pandemic and isolation\n\nPhoto by cottonbro from Pexels\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic frustrates and confounds epidemiologists and immunologists, even after months of study. It frustrates politicians and public health officials dealing with mask non-compliance. It frustrates everyone stuck at home, whether they lost their job or adapting to Zoom.\n\nAfter exposure to the virus, it first enters the lungs, using host machinery to replicate. The virus itself is just a genetic sequence enclosed in a protein and lipid coat. It binds the ACE2 receptors on lung cells, with a spike protein located on its protein-lipid coat. This receptor, attached to the virus, trafficks into the lung cell. Here the virus hijacks the machinery of the cell to replicate, damaging lung tissue and spreading throughout the body.\n\nThe ACE2 receptor, expressed in many regions of the body, is vulnerable to further entry of these viral particles. The ACE2 receptor regulates blood pressure, nutrient absorption and inflammation. These pathways converge and mediate brain health and disease.\n\nThe novel coronavirus perplexed us for many different reasons. A large majority of people who get it don\u2019t display any symptoms, while some display symptoms for many months and others require ventilators to breathe. It is unclear whether someone infected with coronavirus retains long-term immunity.\n\nAlso, troubling findings implicate this disease in the induction of stroke and the worsening of mental health. The realization that there are likely long-term complications of coronavirus infection is worrying, as millions of people may require expensive coverage for this new pre-existing condition.\n\nThose of us lucky to avoid being infected become more socially isolated and lonely. Many studies report the worsening of mental health symptoms, especially in frontline workers, nurses and doctors. These professionals are more prone to burning out and require extra care.\n\nCOVID-19 and Stroke\n\nThe cells in the brain require a disproportionate amount of energy to function. When deprived of oxygen, even for minutes, the cells begin to die, leading to a variety of debilitating sensory, motor or language deficits depending. When there is blood loss to a specific region of the brain, cells cannot use oxygen to generate energy. If there is a clot in an artery, fresh oxygen cannot travel to any regions primarily supplied by that blood vessel. These events, classified as ischemic strokes, cause lifelong disability in some of those afflicted.\n\nEarly findings in patients found abnormal clotting in blood vessels. Vessels around the lungs or even arterial blood-flow to the brain is interrupted. Thus, individuals infected with coronavirus who suffered abnormal blood clotting as a result, were at higher risk of stroke.\n\nIn June of 2020, researchers published a report of neurological symptoms in the New England Journal of Medicine. While they did not report common symptoms of having a stroke, they showed other strange brain-related features. Of thirteen COVID-19 patients who underwent brain imaging, three of them showed signs of an ischemic stroke. A subset of eight of these patients showed other types of inflammation, while eleven presented with a lack of blood flow to the frontal areas of the brain.\n\nThough a preliminary observational study, it suggested that the coronavirus impacted blood clotting and flow to the brain. Several studies since identified swathes of patients suffering from ischemic strokes or brain/vascular inflammation. Another study reviewed the current state of evidence, concluding that 41% of patients suffering from neurological symptoms after COVID-19 infection, suffered from strokes. Larger studies however, are needed to decipher how common this is among all those infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\nDepending on which region of the brain loses oxygen, stroke may manifest as a broad range of symptoms. If cells die in an area of the brain responsible for motor movement, it later manifests in unilateral or bilateral difficulties with movement. Other common symptoms involve fatigue, challenges with balance or walking, partial paralysis, pain or inattention to one entire side of the body. It prevents individuals from doing the things they do in their daily lives, such as dress themselves or go to the bathroom independently.\n\nCOVID-19 and Psychiatric Disorders\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Rados on Unsplash\n\nEither through neuroimmune signalling or by directly entering the cells of the brain, COVID-19 also contributes to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. It is unclear what role it may play in their pathology, but it may worsen existing conditions or as a contributing factor in its development.\n\nOne study compared individuals afflicted with the novel coronavirus to those in quarantine or the general public, finding elevated rates of depression (29.2%) in those with COVID-19. Another small study reported increased post-traumatic stress symptoms in these patients.\n\nIndividuals already living with psychiatric disorders reported a worsening of symptoms in two different studies. Several other studies reported depressive and anxious symptoms worsened among essential workers.\n\nAnother study surveyed >2000 individuals in Denmark, finding a reduction in overall psychological well-being measures during the pandemics. This study also reported that women were more negatively affected than men.\n\nAdditionally, it recognized that many older adults living in adult-care communities during shelter-in-place orders experience loneliness and depression. A study of older adults in San Francisco found that they showed increased rates of loneliness and depression.\n\nWe must do our best to check-up on our friends and loved ones. We are all affected differently by the pandemic, so it is important to recognize that the rates of anxiety, depression and stress-related disorders may arise.\n\nCOVID-19 Long-Haulers\n\nThousands of individuals initially infected with COVID-19, the long-haulers, continue to suffer symptoms many months later. On average, these individuals are women around the age of 44 who are otherwise healthy. Their infections were classified as mild severity because they could recover at home.\n\nFacing stigma and in need of a community, several groups sprouted up to support each other. Originally disbelieved, they rallied to raise awareness of their predicament within the medical establishment. It should no longer be sufficient to classify individuals infected with COVID-19, who don\u2019t require a hospital stay, as mild.\n\nA few different studies report that most individuals affected with COVID-19 suffer from symptoms months later (Italy, UK, Germany). Intriguingly, many long-haulers did not produce high-levels of coronavirus antibodies. Many individuals experience pain, fatigue and many other debilitating symptoms.\n\nThese symptoms are consistent with disturbances in the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for many automatic physiological functions like breathing or heart-rate but also influence fatigue. Preliminary physiotherapy involves reconditioning the nervous system of patients so that they may regain some of these functions. In his article, Ed Yong states:",

        "title": "Mind Your Nose",
        "text": "Mind Your Nose\n\nHow smell training can change your brain in six weeks \u2014 and why it matters.\n\nBy Ann-Sophie Barwich\n\nWhen it comes to training your brain, your sense of smell is possibly the last thing you\u2019d think could strengthen your neural pathways. Learning a new language or reading more books (and fewer social media posts) \u2014 sure. But your nose?\n\nThat\u2019s because the olfactory system is one of the most plastic systems in your brain. Neuroplasticity describes how the brain flexibly adapts to changes in the environment or when exposed to neural damage. Stimulating the brain strengthens existing neural structures and further adds fuel to the brain\u2019s capacity to remain adaptive, thereby keeping it young. And your smell system is particularly adept at repair and renewal. (Olfactory cells have recently been used in human transplant therapy to treat spinal cord injury, for example.)\n\nOne reason for the olfactory system\u2019s adaptive responsiveness is that it undergoes adult neurogenesis. Humans grow new olfactory neurons every three to four weeks throughout their entire life, not just during child development. (These sensory neurons sit in the mucous of your nose, where they pick up airborne chemicals and send activity signals straight to the core of the brain.) If it weren\u2019t for this ongoing regeneration of sensory cells in your nose, we would stop detecting smells after our first few colds.\n\nNeural plasticity weakens as we grow old \u2014 and so does our sense of smell. Olfactory performance decreases around the age of 70 as the regeneration of olfactory neurons slows down. Yet this process of regeneration never stops entirely. Training your nose helps slow down that decline and offers a great way to increase your brain\u2019s plasticity. That said, increasing your sensitivity to odors in the environment does not always sound desirable. Smell usually comes with negative connotations: that whiff of urine in the metro, that overpowering literal skunk, or that trail of body odor from the person walking in front of you. But paying more attention to the smells around you also has benefits, and not just for a greater enjoyment of food aromas and neighbors\u2019 gardens.\n\nRecent studies show that olfactory abilities correspond with differences in cortical areas involved in smell processing in the brain. Johannes Frasnelli, an olfactory scientist at the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, explained: \u201cWe did some studies where we saw that there is a link between the structure of certain brain regions-like the thickness of the cortex and the thickness of the gray matter layer in certain brain olfactory processing regions-and the ability to perceive.\u201d Frasnelli and his colleagues found that people with better perceptual capacities had a thicker cortex. When they looked at people who had lost their sense of smell, they also saw a reduction of cortical matter in areas involved in odor processing.\n\nThat raises the question: Could you change the structure of your brain simply by smelling things? In 2019, Frasnelli\u2019s group discovered that undergoing as little as six weeks of intense olfactory training results in significant structural changes in some regions of the brain (namely, the right inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral fusiform gyrus, and the right entorhinal cortex).\n\nParticipants were given three tasks with a cognitive component.\n\nThe first task was a classification task. Participants had to organize two simple odor mixtures by ordering each from lowest to highest concentration. The second was an identification task. Participants were presented with a target odor blended with a citrus scent in a specific ratio (4%). Then they were given the same blend in different ratios and asked to order them according to quality (more citrusy or less?). Lastly, the detection task: Was the learned target odor present in a range of 14 samples of different odor mixtures or not?\n\nThis entire exercise was undertaken each day for 20 minutes during the six weeks. Responses were monitored and evaluated on speed and accuracy.\n\nSuch intense olfactory training led to a general improvement in olfactory performance. Plus, the increase of olfactory skill was not restricted to the training exercises but also transferred to other olfactory abilities-abilities that had not been tested as part of the training. These perceptual tests included: the detection threshold of an odor, accuracy in odor discrimination (same or different?), cued odor identification (which of these four descriptors is correct?), and even free odor identification (identifying an odor without cues!).\n\nIncreasing insight into what the nose knows, and how it communicates with the brain, has broader implications-even philosophical ones. Old (yet still prevalent) cookie-cutter views of the mind coax us to believe that our senses are passive-indifferently picking up signals in the world that are then processed by the brain. Perception, in such views, is a process separate from cognition. Highly plastic systems such as olfaction present us with a much more intriguing and interwoven picture of the mind: Training your nose\u2019s performance (just like other cognitive capacities) fundamentally shapes what you perceive by rewiring the system.\n\nYour senses are far from being impartial transmitters; what you are able to perceive in the world ultimately hinges on the depth of your cognitive engagement with it. In other words, your mind does not emerge apathetically as a product of some remarkable, intricate molecular twists performed by the brain. The mind is enhanced by what you can train your brain to do. Just like strength is a result of muscle training, cognitive training of the senses is the bodybuilding of the brain.",

        "text": "You\u2019ve heard of him, haven\u2019t you? Phineas Gage. The railroad worker who survived an explosion that involved an iron rod piercing through his left cheek and out of his brain and skull.\n\nYeah.\n\nI know.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering \u201cyeah, alright sweet. What about him?\u201d Well, let\u2019s just say that he was a really popular patient for the field of neuroscience (Cherry, par. 1). And what I found the most interesting about this tragic event was the science of his behavior afterward.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know much about Phineas Gage, let me fill you in with the help of my research.\n\nPhineas Gage, 25 years old, was a railroad worker in Vermont. One day, at work, he was using an iron rod to handle explosive gun powder. As he was using the iron rod to handle the gun powder, an explosion suddenly occurred. The iron rod then went through his left cheek and brain. Fortunately, he survived and was able to talk and walk after the accident (Cherry, par. 2\u20133).\n\nWhy did people say that Phineas Gage was a \u201cdifferent person\u201d after his accident? It actually has to do with neuroscience.\n\nThe iron rod went through his brain, in particular, it went through the frontal lobe of his brain. Does this mean that the frontal lobe of your brain has to do with the kind of person you are? To answer this question, we have to understand what the frontal lobe in our brain is responsible for.\n\nOur frontal lobes are responsible for many things. Some of them are higher-order thinking, personality, and decision making. This explains why people who knew Phineas Gage said that he was a totally different person after the accident. Since the iron rod went through his frontal lobe, it means that his personality and thinking, as a whole, completely changed, making him seem like he was a whole different person due to the way he started acting.\n\nThis accident and the treatment of Phineas Gage actually played a big role in the field of neurology. His case helped scientists better understand the role of the frontal cortex of the brain (Cherry, par. 16\u201317).\n\nBibliography\n\nCherry, Kendra. \u201cThe Famous Case of Phineas Gage\u2019s Astonishing Brain Injury.\u201d Phineas Gage\u2019s Astonishing Brain Injury, Verywell Mind, 3 Oct. 2019, www.verywellmind.com/phineas-gage-2795244#targetText=The%20rod%20penetrated%20Gage's%20left,be%20seen%20by%20a%20doctor.",

        "title": "Mentally, Young Adults Are Suffering Most From COVID",
        "text": "Mentally, Young Adults Are Suffering Most From COVID\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to having a painful feeling, the only way out is through.\u201d\n\nPhoto created by the author on Canva Pro\n\n\u201cYoung individuals reported higher acute stress and depressive symptoms than older respondents, suggesting that despite being most deadly for older populations at the time of our data collection, the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have had widespread impacts across populations.\u201d \u2014 Holman et al., Science Advances 2020\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that COVID-19 and the pandemic have been detrimental to people\u2019s mental health. However, the group that\u2019s suffered the most from COVID-19 is young adults, who have had the biggest mental toll from COVID. Holman et al. found that 62.9 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds reported an anxiety or depressive disorder, and a quarter found they were using more than alcohol or drugs to cope with their pandemic stress. The researchers found that a quarter of the age group \u201cseriously considered suicide\u201d between mid-March to mid-April.\n\nThe conclusion from those findings is that young people are suffering most mentally from COVID. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t find these findings that surprising. I know a lot of people struggle with COVID. I\u2019m struggling with COVID, and I\u2019m in that age range of 18- to 24-year-olds \u2014 and I experience that phenomenon as much as anyone in my age range.\n\nBut Claudia Wallis at Scientific American reports on more than just the mental health of youth mental health during COVID. A report from the CDC in August found that incidences of anxiety symptoms tripled and depression quadrupled in a representative sample. And the most affected are people who had pre-existing mental health issues, people of color, and low-income individuals, so the vulnerable individuals in society are more vulnerable during the pandemic.\n\nInterestingly enough, Ettman et al. found that Asian individuals saw an almost fivefold increase in depression, and some psychiatrists who talked to Wallis attributed that to racism and slurs related to the Asian-Americans. As an Asian-American, the pandemic is forcing me to confront anti-Asian racism in a way I\u2019ve never done so before. According to Holman et al., young people may have been more depressed because:\n\n\u201c[They] may have had more disruption in life events: graduations, weddings, the senior year of college and of high school. All those transitions were disrupted, as well as school and social connections, which we know are very important for young people.\u201d\n\nAnd the researchers also found that increased exposure to media coverage about the coronavirus led to more distress. Sensationalist reports lead to more anxiety and depression, and clearly the lack of social connection also disproportionately affects young people. Psychologist Logan Jones stresses that much of the reporting these days keeps people hooked on the news cycle, and keeps people addicted to the news. As such, Jones emphasizes the importance of keeping boundaries.\n\n\u201cConsuming too much of this kind of news, whether actively or passively, can be very toxic, and what you hear has an impact on your mood,\u201d Jones says.\n\nThe CDC also states that the mental health of young adults has been impacted socially, emotionally, and mentally. They attribute these mental health concerns to the trauma faced at a developmental age, and all hands are on deck for parents, caregivers, and other adults to support children and young people. Part of that trauma is a result of changes in routines, employment, and educational challenges, a loss of security and safety, and missed significant life events.\n\nAs a teacher during COVID, almost all of my students say they want to return to the physical school building during COVID. They report being more lonely and isolated, and can\u2019t wait to return to see their friends and teachers again. My school is emphasizing more relationship-building activities and prioritizing mental health during lessons more than adhering to a curriculum as a result.\n\nTakeaways\n\nWell, the problem is difficult and can seem negative, but what can young people do to tackle mental health concerns during COVID?\n\nThe CDC states that to fight stress during COVID, young people need to recognize and address fear, stress, and behavioral changes during COVID. Health concerns are certainly a priority for young people as well, and excessive worry and sadness leads to trouble paying attention, trouble concentrating, and trouble focusing on activities.\n\nIt is also important for young people to stay socially connected. Staying socially connected through video chats, Zoom, and phone calls is also a solution.\n\nBut honestly, we\u2019re all doing the best we can, and it\u2019s very important to recognize that as we go through our days. Whatever we\u2019re going through is valid and reasonable, and above all, normal.\n\nFor me, what\u2019s helped my mental health is spending time with my girlfriend and my friends within reason, limiting how much I doomscroll, and get enough sleep. I try to exercise and maintain a fitness challenge, but what works for me certainly won\u2019t work for everyone.\n\nUnicef emphasizes that it\u2019s important to feel your feelings instead of trying to resist them, as well. According to Dr. Lisa Damour:",

Your words can reach further and do more good than you ever imagined.\n\nYou\u2019re already here on Medium writing for the masses. Maybe you have a blog, too. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s infinitely easier to get traffic here than it is on your own property.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nWhen it\u2019s your own place, you have to invite people to come. They won\u2019t necessarily see you when they\u2019re surfing the web, looking for content like yours. The keywords might bring your site to the top if you\u2019ve done your homework and bought a few (or a lot of) ads. If you\u2019ve got a hefty budget to spend before you make a dime, that can be a great way to go.\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t?\n\nHope for those on a limited budget\n\nWhen you first start out, you\u2019ve got a big dream. You know your story is good. You know it can change people\u2019s lives. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s truth or fiction. The truth is, even fiction has a bit of truth in it. If it didn\u2019t, it would be fantasy. We need things to make sense, even in a made up world or we can\u2019t follow what\u2019s happening, much less believe it enough to read it.\n\nI write nonfiction, most of the time, so what I share here will come from that perspective. If you\u2019re a storyteller, there are still principles here you can use to promote your work. So stay with me, okay?\n\nThe beauty of writing on a platform like Medium is you don\u2019t have to spend a dime to get paid. You do have to spend time \u2014 and we all have some of that. Here\u2019s how you\u2019ll spend it:\n\nBrainstorming ideas\n\nRefining those ideas into drafts\n\nEditing your writing for prime time\n\nSharing a bit on social media, your own work and the work of others\n\nYou can cash in on community when you contribute something valuable to it. The more valuable it is, the more likely others will read it, comment on it, and share it. When you do the same for others, some will want to pay you back.\n\nGenerosity is the key to growth.\n\nWrite to learn what people want\n\nA book is an ambitious project.\n\nSome say it takes a year or more. Others say you can write a book a week. I\u2019m not sure I advocate either of these approaches.\n\nI say writing a book should take long enough for it to be effective. Depending on your subject and how much time you have, that could take three months or nine months. If you know a lot up front, the process will be shorter. If you have to do a lot of research, budget that time in.\n\nSo what makes a book effective? How do you answer that question?\n\nPhoto by bruce mars on Unsplash\n\nFirst, your book is effective when it satisfies a reader\u2019s need.\n\nWhat do your readers want? If you have a following, you already know, don\u2019t you? They probably want a few things like:\n\nEntertainment\n\nInformation\n\nHope\n\nAn escape\n\nChances are, they want a mix of these things. As you blog, invite your readers to talk to you. Use that feedback to discover what\u2019s missing in their lives that they want more of. Then you can take on the responsibility to provide it to them.\n\nIf they feel the need strongly enough, they\u2019ll buy.\n\nSecond, your book is effective when it fills a gap.\n\nDon\u2019t just write another leadership book because people buy a lot of them.\n\nThe same goes for romance, historical fiction, writing advice, or whatever your speciality is.\n\nGive them something they can\u2019t get anywhere else.\n\nHow do you figure out what\u2019s missing?\n\nRead a few other books, preferably the bestsellers. What do they cover? How well do they do it? What might you do even better than this author?\n\nScan the reviews. Is there something people want that the book doesn\u2019t cover? Is there something people complain about that you can make irrelevant in your book? Read the most popular reviews, positive and negative. Make notes. Then use what you learn to make your book shine.\n\nTalk to people who\u2019ve read these books if you can. Ask them what they liked about them, and what they didn\u2019t. What do they wish the author had covered that he didn\u2019t? What did the author include that they think should have been left out?\n\nFeel free to reward those who help you with a free copy of your awesome book.\n\nThird, test your material in blog posts and refine it in the book.\n\nBefore you write your draft in silence and refine it for your book, why not test it with the people who already read your content?\n\nYou\u2019ll learn a lot this way:\n\nWhether your readers think your idea is as good as you do\n\nWhat questions they have about your content\n\nHow clearly and persuasively you\u2019re making your points\n\nWouldn\u2019t you rather know this before you spend a year in front of your desk writing your masterpiece? Better to let it walk in public first before it runs on the digital presses.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried people might not buy your book when they can read it online, here\u2019s a bit of insurance to nudge them forward \u2014 include some surprises in the book that they can\u2019t get anywhere else.\n\nAlso, you don\u2019t have to transfer it word for word if you don\u2019t want to. You\u2019ll probably need to add some transitions so it all flows together. This will become clearer as you work through your blog series.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have a book that already took a test drive before you hit publish. There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be the number one bestseller, but you\u2019ll sure have a better shot than you will with a book you write on speculation.\n\nWhen you already have a following, at least some of them will be eager to buy your book on day one.\n\nPhoto by Kenny Luo on Unsplash\n\nFinally, it\u2019s not all about you\n\nThere are so many people trying to sell something now it\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nAnd yeah, I know, I\u2019m asking you to be one more of them.\n\nYou can set yourself apart by focusing on service. Sure, you\u2019ve gotta get paid. We all need to eat. You soften the blow when you provide more value than what it costs to get that value. People are already spending money on books, courses, and the like. They buy when they believe what they\u2019re getting is more valuable than the cash in their pocket.\n\nWhen you test drive your book on your blog, you can establish value as you go. Each post should add to the overall value of the total package. With all that going for you, you\u2019ll have no guilt. Marketing won\u2019t feel so slimy. You know your book is good, and you can stand behind it with honest pride.\n\nMake it about them and they\u2019ll make your dream come true.\n\nDo that and I\u2019ll see you on the bestseller list!",

        "title": "Dr Faisal Dar \u2014 Pioneer of Liver Transplantation in Pakistan",
        "text": "Dr Faisal Dar \u2014 Pioneer of Liver Transplantation in Pakistan\n\nDr. Fasial Dar is the pioneer of liver transplantation in Pakistan. He works at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad where he conducted the first ever transplant in 2010 of a 9 year old boy. Recently, along with his team he has successfully completed 200 transplant surgeries in Pakistan.\n\nFatima Arif: Give us some of your personal background; your family and education background.\n\nDr. Faisal Dar: I was born in Faisalabad; but due to my father\u2019s death when I was very young; my family decided to move back to our native village, Kotla Bhalot, in\n\nKharian, District Gujrat. There I completed my basic education from a local school, leading to Matric and F.Sc from Kharian Cantt.\n\nMy MBBS is from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. After that I completed my FCPS (surgery): Fellow of College of Physicians & Surgeons from Pakistan. Then I went to Ireland for my FRCS (Surgery) Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. This was followed by Fellowship in Liver Transplantation/Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery from Kings College London School of Medicine, UK. Additionally, I am also a Fellow of European Board in Transplant Surgery (FEBTS \u2014 Transplant Surgery).\n\nFA: When did you decide to become a doctor, was it a personal choice or like the majority here your parents idea and how did you decide to opt for this specialty?\n\nFD: My family wanted me to join Pakistan Army; becoming a doctor was my own choice. Since I qualified the merit list for medical college; so it was easy to convince my family to let me follow my calling.\n\nSurgery was my passion since the start and that is why after completing my house job I decided to go for my fellowship in general surgery. After completing my training and exams I went to UK for further specialization in 2003. At that time there was no liver transplant and hepatopancreaticobiliary surgeons in Pakistan and considering the huge need for this facility in our country I decided to opt this specialty.\n\nFA: Share your journey of how the liver transplants started and what is the procedure whereby patients are selected?\n\nFD: The first liver transplant in humans was done in 1963. Liver transplant went through two decades of evolution and scientific work, and it was only in 1983 when liver transplant was accepted as the standard treatment for liver failure. Since then huge number of liver transplants are carried out across the world. Living donor liver transplant (in which a healthy individual donates a part of his liver to his beloved one) started in early 1990\u2019s; the techniques and procedures got matured by 2000, and now living donor liver transplant is the standard accepted options for patients with liver failure in countries where donations after brain death does not exists.\n\nAfter completing my training at King\u2019s College Hospital, London, I decided to come back to Pakistan and start liver transplant program in my country. I was lucky to get good colleagues and tremendous support from the management to get the basic work done before we could do our first liver transplant on 30th April 2010 at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad. Personally it was a very happy and emotional moment and a great honor for me as a doctor to be the pioneer of liver transplantation in Pakistan.\n\nPatients go through an extensive assessment process to determine their candidacy for liver transplant. In short any patient who\u2019s liver has failed either due to a chronic disease (like hepatitis B & C, autoimmune liver diseases etc.) or suffer from acute liver failure (due to hepatitis E, A or other viruses, drugs or toxins) and patients who have developed liver cancer can benefit from liver transplant. Patients who are unfit to go through such a major operation (due to severe heart or lung disease) or patients who have advanced cancer are not considered for liver transplant because they will not benefit in short or long term from liver transplant.\n\nFA: How are patients who can\u2019t afford the procedure included in the process and how is there funding secured?\n\nFD: Liver transplant is one of the most complex operation in the medical field. In order to conduct a liver transplant there are some minimal standards that need to be followed by the hospital. Without these basic set standards and the highest level of skill set it is not possible to do a liver transplant successfully. Someone has to bear the cost of the operation. At the moment majority of the patients pay out of their own pocket. Some are funded by the insurance companies, some by the Government and some by different NGO\u2019s.\n\nPakistan is a beautiful country. Its natural beauty comprising of landscapes, deserts, rivers, planes and the mighty mountains is matchless. The people of Pakistan are loving and caring, known for their hospitality.\n\nFA: What is the future you see for Pakistan\u2019s medical community in terms of the latest treatments and technology?\n\nFD: Technology is not a big issue as the world has become a global village and access to technology has been made easier. The most important factor is the human resource. Pakistan needs expat doctors to come back; transfer knowledge, techniques and train the future generations to the latest available treatments in the world.\n\nFA: Share one inspiring story that you came across over the period of your career that had a lasting impact on you?\n\nFD: The story that had an impact on me and is close to my heart is from our first liver transplant at Shifa International Hospital. The patient, Muhammad Yasin, a 9 year old boy who was in a need of liver transplant. He was the only son after seven daughters, and none of the family members had a matching blood group for them to donate a part of their liver to save his life. It was his 21 years old cousin; Humaira; a university student who volunteered herself to go through an operation to save her cousin\u2019s life. The courage of this young girl, the bond of the family and the faith they had on us was amazing. It has been three years down the line both, Yasin and Humaira are living a normal life.\n\nFA: Pakistan faces brain drain, specifically in the medical field. What is your take on it and in your opinion what is the solution to this problem?\n\nFD: Personally, I think Pakistani doctors need to go abroad to get exposure to the Western world, that not only enhances their medical knowledge, but it grooms them. Furthermore this exposure adds to their confidence while at the same time teaches them better patient care procedures.\n\nHowever, I also believe that these doctors after improving their skills should come back and serve Pakistan. A lot of responsibility also lies on the Government to improve the public sector hospitals and to redefine service structure for doctors. If our hospitals are upgraded and the doctors are offered decent salaries, I think a lot of doctors will prefer coming back home.\n\nFA: What is your message to the international community about Pakistan, where you would like to change at least one stereotype about the country and its people?\n\nFD: Pakistan is a beautiful country. Its natural beauty comprising of landscapes, deserts, rivers, planes and the mighty mountains is matchless. The people of Pakistan are loving and caring, known for their hospitality.\n\nOur youth is really talented and determine to work for a better future. There are macro level issues, like corruption, bad governance and terrorism that are the obstacles in the materializing of the country\u2019s true potential. I hope to play whatever role I can to help our younger generation break these shekels and realize their dreams.",

        "title": "Sunlight \u2014 The Natural Supplement For Our Mental Health",
        "text": "Sunlight \u2014 The Natural Supplement For Our Mental Health\n\nThe science behind how the sun is related to our mental wellbeing\n\nPhoto by Rampal Singh on Unsplash\n\nYoga, meditation, binaural beats, aroma therapy. All of these are our attempts at improving our mental health. More than ever, this generation has spoken out about mental health issues and have taken considerable steps in order to try and improve our mental health.\n\nYet, amongst the many techniques that seem to be popular, it\u2019s surprising that being under the sunlight isn\u2019t something that everybody does.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s completely free and can be done easily (at least when it isn\u2019t winter).\n\nSunlight and Serotonin\n\nExperts often associate exposure to sunlight with the release of serotonin. And this has been proven by science.\n\nA study conducted to find the relationship between serotonin, sunlight, and the season found that the rate of serotonin production is directly related to the prevailing duration of bright sunlight. At the same time, as the luminosity of the sunlight increased, the rate of serotonin production also rose rapidly.\n\nFurthermore, it has been reported in Times that autopsy studies found higher levels of serotonin in individuals that passed away in summer than those who did in winter. This difference in serotonin level was attributed to the differing amounts of sunlight available between the two different seasons.\n\nSo\u2026 exposure to sunlight is associated with the release of serotonin. But what does that have to do with mental health?\n\nSerotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine) is actually a neurotransmitter and is known as the natural \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemical. This is due to its role as a natural mood stabilizer and its ability to reduce the symptoms of depression.\n\nAs such, by increasing the rate of serotonin production, sunlight acts as a natural mood booster, allowing one to feel happier while reducing the negative effects that are often associated with depression.\n\nIn fact, in 2018, a study conducted by Chinese researchers found that moderate exposure to sunlight correlates to an improvement in memory and motor learning in mice. While humans might function differently from mice, this study suggests that a similar relation could be happening for us.\n\nAdditionally, results from another study also suggested that exposure to sunlight is associated with the cognitive decline one experiences. In this study, the researchers found that individuals with a decreased exposure of sunlight experienced a higher probability of cognitive decline. This was especially true for individuals with existing depression.\n\nSunlight and Melatonin\n\nApart from serotonin, sunlight plays a key role in the release of another chemical \u2014 melatonin. However, instead of being produced when it is sunny, melatonin is produced when it is dark. The lower the light intensity, the more melatonin secreted.\n\nWhile serotonin is a feel-good chemical, melatonin is the natural hormone that promotes sleep in our bodies. As it becomes dark, our body secretes more melatonin in order to prepare us for sleep. This means that melatonin is essential to help us regulate our sleep cycles.\n\nHowever, there is evidence that suggests that shift workers who work through the night (and as such, are less exposed to sunlight) produce less melatonin. Without this sleep producing hormone, one could possibly experience insomnia and low quality sleep from sleep disturbances.\n\nAs quality sleep is key to maintaining a healthy mind, exposing yourself to sunlight can help encourage your body to create melatonin, allowing you to get a good night\u2019s rest (and an improved mental state).\n\nFurthermore, normal melatonin secretion is key to maintaining our bodies\u2019 natural circadian rhythm. As a disruption of the natural circadian rhythm is known to increase the risk of depression, going under the sun to maintain healthy levels of melatonin production could be key in helping you keep depression at bay.\n\nLack of Sunlight Leaves You SAD\n\nWith sunlight playing key roles in the creation of serotonin and melatonin, a lack of sunlight can actually lead to a condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).\n\nSAD is actually a form of depression that typically affects individuals during the winter seasons (explaining the lethargy and helplessness you might feel when winter comes). While sunlight is not the only factor, it is suggested that SAD primarily affects individuals in winter as one is less likely to be exposed to strong sunlight. And this points to the importance of sunlight exposure. In order to help reduce the possibility of SAD (especially when it isn\u2019t even winter yet), try your best to expose yourself to natural sunlight as much as possible. Who knows, that might just be the key to helping you keep illnesses like SAD at bay.\n\nSunlight and Vitamin D\n\nApart from serotonin and melatonin, sunlight plays a key role in helping our bodies synthesize vitamin D. A fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption (strengthening your bones) while also supporting the immune system.\n\nA lack of vitamin D in one\u2019s body actually increases the risk of osteoporosis, jaundice, and cardiovascular diseases. As physical well being is tied closely to one\u2019s mental health, getting a healthy dose of vitamin D helps protect your mental wellness by maintaining your physical health.\n\nBesides physical health, vitamin D also has a surprising role in mental health as well. Researchers have found that when one has a vitamin D level of below 20 nanograms per millimeter, the risk of depression is raised by as much as 85 percent when compared to individuals with vitamin D levels of more than 30 nanograms per millimeter).\n\nStudies done also suggest that there is a casual relation between taking vitamin D supplements and an improvement in symptoms for those who suffer from depression. As few foods offer vitamin D naturally, going out into the sun might be the best (and easiest) way to help your body get enough vitamin D.\n\nBut How Much Sunlight is Enough?\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve all heard warnings that tell us not to go out into the sun. As sunlight is made up of ultraviolet (UV) rays, experts often warn us about prolonged exposure to strong sunlight.\n\nAfter all, UV rays damage our skin cells, promoting the formation of blemishes and wrinkles while increasing the risk of skin cancer.\n\nHowever, Dr. James O\u2019Keefe, a cardiologist who studies the relationship between vitamin D and cardiovascular health, believes that we are evolved to be in the presence of direct sun exposure, claiming that having some direct sunlight helps benefit our health greatly.\n\nIn fact, WHO has published guidelines regarding the amount of sunlight exposure we should have. With the beneficial effects of sunlight exposure, WHO suggests getting 5\u201315 minutes of unblocked (e.g. no sunscreen, no long sleeves) sunlight on our face, arms and hands 2\u20133 times a week.\n\nWith more and more of us spending an increased number of time indoors, going out for occasional sunlight exposure can greatly help improve your mental health.\n\nOf course, as UV rays can still cause your skin harm, do keep your direct sunlight exposure short and avoid periods with strong UV radiation (e.g. noon). If you are going to be out in the sun for an extended period of time, protect yourself with sunscreen. And for those with skin conditions, it might be good to ask your doctor for advice before heading out to bask in the sun.",

        "title": "Occam\u2019s dice",
        "text": "Occam\u2019s dice\n\nDistrusting biological metaphors\n\n\u201cThe aim of science is to seek the simplest explanation of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be \u2018Seek simplicity and distrust it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alfred North Whitehead\n\nSimplicity is powerful. Economists seek minimal models to describe market fluctuations, and our greatest mathematicians use the guiding light of elegance to discover their next great truths. But is this preference a fundamental reflection of nature\u2019s workings, or an aesthetic one? Occam\u2019s razor \u2014 positing that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one \u2014 is particularly abused in biology. As Eve Marder has long argued, biological systems are equipped with redundant strategies and contingencies that confound the interpretation of even the most tightly controlled biological experiments. Even the idea of probing a \u201ccontrolled\u201d biological system merits careful reflection. By controlling for variables, we stray from reality, instead describing an abstract, manipulated system, and often still failing to account for the hundreds of cellular mechanisms we don\u2019t yet know about. (Take, for example, surprising work from Didier Stanier and colleagues, who recently reported that knocking out a gene with CRISPR leads to the expression of homologous genes to compensate for the loss.) In a debate held a decade ago, Richard Dawkins and Lynn Margulis argued about the role of symbiosis in evolutionary theory. An exasperated Dawkins asked: \u201cwhy on earth would you want to drag in symbiogenesis when it\u2019s so unparsimonious and uneconomical?\u201d Margulis replied: \u201cbecause it\u2019s there.\u201d Parsimony for parsimony\u2019s sake is not parsimonious in the biosciences.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that our formalization of biology is fundamentally historical \u2014 philosophers like Hans-Jorg Rheinberger, Bachelard, and others have argued that biology has been primarily technology (rather than hypothesis) driven. The ideas of biology are inextricable from the technology that produces them. As Rheinberger put it: \u201cphenomena and instrument, object and experience, concept and method are all engaged in a running process of mutual instruction.\u201d Our resultant understanding of nature is dominated by our choice of experimental system, which includes our instruments, the model organism, even the culture wherein a discovery is made: the knowledge generated is, in some very real ways, as contingent as the processes it describes. We fit discovered phenomena with simple handles \u2014 reduced, for practical purposes, to a sort of currency to be exchanged between labs, resorting to pale metaphors when communicating the natural mysteries.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear why we do this. It\u2019s in part a heuristic shortcut, making things easier to wrap our heads around. We want to understand nature \u2014 we, being individual humans, not as the vague \u201chuman collective.\u201d We therefore seek truths comprehensible to a single intellect; and so, as the parable goes, we\u2019re searching for our keys under a streetlamp. Even so, it seems so inherently obvious, so inarguable that true things should be simpler things. The instinct to discover the rules of nature is older than man: the nervous system is biology\u2019s greatest prediction algorithm, and it dutifully learns patterns whose knowledge might enhance its chance of survival (science being the formal application of this impulse). Thus, human thought is underpinned by an unconscious aesthetic laid down in the nervous system itself.\n\nStudies suggest we naturally tend to find satisfaction in simplicity, in learnability (often through repetition)\u2014 in that which is easy to process. In music, for example, the most universally enjoyable songs lie somewhere between tedious simplicity (like the worst of pop) and unpredictable entropy (like some modern composers). We\u2019re just acting after our nervous system\u2019s modus operandi when we seek learnable patterns. Maxims that appear to be self-evident \u2014 e.g. something along Occam\u2019s logic, \u201ca simpler explanation is better\u201d \u2014 may only appear to be so because they\u2019re rewarded within the system that evaluates them. That is, they\u2019re self-reflective: the nervous system, itself effectively a simplifying model of its environment, seeks to uncover patterns that render its existence more manageable. It\u2019s evaluating a reductive internal model against its own implicit function. The mind is a causality inferring machine: the impetus to ascribe linear causal relationships is inbuilt to our nervous system. Armed with this hammer, the whole messy universe looks like an elegant nail.\n\nOf course, ultimately, what we want to do with science is to uncover what Dawkins has referred to as \u201ceconomically expressed rules.\u201d We are interested in the objects of life primarily because they point us to the process of life. We don\u2019t count the color bands of a beetle for the sake of knowing this fact, but because our understanding of rules often emerges from collections of observations \u2014 in the beetle\u2019s case, for example, untangling the logic of developmental programs. But is there even a clear boundary between biological object and process?\n\nFor example, it\u2019s often said that biological entities perform computations (we\u2019ll ignore, for the time being, the fact that no one can agree what is meant by computation): the organism an object, and computation its process. In doing so we suppose a separation between software and hardware, algorithm and data. But organisms are also the result of computations: cells can be thought of as \u201ctesting hypotheses\u201d during the development of an embryo, for example. Both evolution and nervous systems are the results of computations becoming embodied in the architecture of their computers. Even in machine learning, as Sunderhauf et al. recently argued, \u201cthere is a spectrum \u2014 rather than a dichotomy \u2014 between programming and data.\u201d Indeed, the success of machine learning, despite its inelegance, underscores the fact that simplicity isn\u2019t necessarily a useful goal.\n\nEvolution has never (until, perhaps, soon) operated by reason, but rolls of a die. The resultant systems are rife with feedback loops and interdependencies. Neuroscientists too often conflate observational studies with causal explanations of behaviors, but a description or manipulation of what neurons or networks are active during a behavior is not the explanans of that behavior. \u2018Necessary and sufficient\u2019 doesn\u2019t work the way neuroscientists usually use it. Thirty years ago, Randolf DiDomenico and colleagues proposed that we avoid making causal claims in individual papers, and instead build them from multiple studies using various techniques and approaches. Given the sheer complexity of these networks and amount of data we\u2019ve generated, this is increasingly beyond the scope of individual human intellect. All this is to say: think hard about what it is you wish to show with your studies. Be humble in your claims. Pragmatism may be a more holy grail than Truth. Or, as Hemingway (perhaps apocryphally) advised: kill your darlings.\n\nWant more? Follow us at The Spike\n\nTwitter: @kellybclancy",

        "title": "To Quickly Build Trust, Tell Your Origin Story",
        "text": "Photo credit: Leo Leung\n\nPeople want to know why you do what you do.\n\nIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur, your investors, customers, and employees want to know why you founded your company. Apply for a job, and recruiters ask about your career path. If you\u2019re a freelancer, everyone is curious about how you got started.\n\nWhy do we crave origin stories? Because they reveal character. Superman is a good guy because his planet exploded, his parents sent him to Earth, and the Kents raised him to fight evil. Steve Jobs became a trusted CEO, in part, by bouncing back from failure. My dad thrived as a home builder, but only after terminating a partnership with a prominent colleague whose practices he found unethical.\n\nIn other words:\n\nYour origin story helps people decide whether or not to trust you.\n\nHow to Craft a Powerful Origin Story: The 5 Essential Elements\n\nIn strategic messaging and positioning engagements with CEOs, as well as business storytelling workshops for teams, I\u2019ve helped hundreds of people construct origin stories. The best instantly convey not only trustworthiness, but also traits like commitment, persistence, and curiosity.\n\nSo what makes a great origin story work?\n\nAt the heart of every great origin story is a single event that forever changes the course of the teller\u2019s life. Typically it arises out of failure or disappointment; sometimes it\u2019s an unexpected discovery. Very frequently, another person illuminates a new way forward.\n\nCan you pinpoint the event that set you on your current path? (Yes, we all have one.) The event doesn\u2019t have to be life-changing in the \u201cI won the lottery\u201d sense (though congrats if that happened). It just has to reorient you towards what you\u2019re doing now.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified your event, construct your origin story around it using the following five components, and tell it in this order:\n\n1. Once upon a time\u2026\n\nHow was your life before the life-changing event? Most importantly, what did you want back then? Share relevant details: How old were you? Where did you live? When did this happen? (No, you don\u2019t literally have to start with \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201d)\n\nFor example, here\u2019s the \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201d for my origin story:\n\nBack in the dot-com years, I was living in Manhattan, struggling to fund my startup. It was not going well. One VC attached a hand-written note to his standard rejection letter: \u201cAndy, I rate every business plan I receive on a scale of one to 10. Yours is a one.\u201d At the bottom, he wrote, \u201cP.S. Not a compelling story.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cThen one day\u2026\u201d\n\nNext, describe your life-changing event. If possible, tell this section as a scene with details that the listener can sense (visualize, hear, smell, etc.). Again, here\u2019s mine:\n\nOne day, I\u2019m walking up Broadway, when I notice a huge sign in the window of a Barnes and Noble. The sign says, \u201cFor anyone who wants to tell a compelling story,\u201d and it\u2019s pointing to a book about screenwriting. I buy the book.\n\n3. \u201cBecause of that\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat relevant events were then set in motion? What obstacles did you have to overcome? Basically, describe what happened next:\n\nThat night, I read the book from cover to cover. It\u2019s written in the language of feature films (three act structure, etc.), but much of it seems to apply to telling the story of a startup. I rewrite my pitch and send it to a new batch of investors.\n\n4. \u201cUntil finally\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat was the turning point \u2014 the moment when you really committed to the new path? It\u2019s especially effective to reflect here on how you changed and what you learned:\n\nAfter receiving the revised pitch, several investor groups invite my team to their offices, and four months later we have a term sheet from a prominent Silicon Valley venture firm. The numbers, the team \u2014 all remained same. The only thing that changed was how we told our story.\n\n5. \u201cSo now\u2026\u201d\n\nLast but not least, describe what you do now, and connect it to the story.\n\nSo now I help leadership teams craft strategic messaging and positioning, which is really just their story \u2014 the story they use to power fundraising, sales, marketing, recruiting, and product. I also teach storytelling workshops for teams. And I can trace it all back to my failed pitch.\n\nSwap Origin Stories with Others to Quickly Build Stronger Relationships\n\nOnce you\u2019ve drafted your own origin story, tell it a few times to see what works. That\u2019s not to say you should introduce yourself to strangers with \u201cOnce upon a time...\u201d But if you\u2019re embarking on a relationship with someone new \u2014 a customer, a prospect, an investor\u2014 and they ask, try it out. Pay particular attention to where they lean in.\n\nAlso, ask others to tell you their origin stories. Listen closely, and you\u2019ll quickly learn about their character, values and desires, which can be helpful in all sorts of relationships.\n\nAs one woman in my recent General Assembly workshop said after swapping origin stories with a classmate: \u201cThere\u2019s something about sharing these stories that makes me feel instantly connected.\u201d",

        "title": "Four Exercises to Strengthen Your Writing",
        "text": "A few months ago, I wrote an article sharing several writing exercises from famous authors.\n\nJust as pianists practice scales to strengthen their skills like rhythm and timing, writers can sharpen specific skills through deliberate practice.\n\nSince publishing that original article, I\u2019ve been searching for more creative writing exercises, and I discovered four more gems that I\u2019m excited to share with you today.\n\nStruggling to write effective dialogue? Or craft vivid descriptions? Or maybe you\u2019re facing writer\u2019s block?\n\nThese creative writing exercises will help you overcome those obstacles.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n(Please note that links to books on Amazon might be affiliate links which means I\u2019ll earn a small commission if you buy through the link with no extra cost to you. Thank you!)\n\nThe George R.R. Martin Exercise for Writing Effective Dialogue\n\nAt the Neuch\u00e2tel Fantastic Film Festival in Switzerland, an interviewer asked fantasy writer George R.R. Martin what qualities are needed to be a good writer.\n\nAmong several pieces of advice, Martin stressed the importance of having \u201ca good ear for dialogue and the way people actually speak \u2026 the individuality to give each character his own method of speaking.\u201d\n\nEasier said than done, right? Lucky for us, Martin went on to share a writing exercise that can help you sharpen your dialogue skills:\n\nI sometimes teach writing classes. And there are various exercises you can give to students. One of them is to describe a half dozen different characters. Write a speech for each of these different characters without a name tag. Just say, \u201cHere\u2019s a priest, here\u2019s a soldier, here\u2019s a housewife\u201d\u2026 Invent whatever you want. Write a speech for each of them in which\u2026they don\u2019t give their name\u2026just make each speech sound different from the other so you can instantly know just from the words this is the priest speaking, this is the prostitute speaking\u2026 If they all sound the same, you have a problem. They should sound different.\n\nA bonus tip: make sure to read your dialogue out loud. That\u2019s a fantastic way to test whether your conversations sound authentic.\n\nThe Dani Shapiro Exercise for Banishing Writer\u2019s Block\n\nEver sit down at your computer to begin writing a new short story or a new personal essay, but instead you find yourself having a stare down with the blank screen? You may type a few lines, but after several minutes you delete everything. You just can\u2019t seem to find the right words to continue.\n\nNew York Times bestselling-author Dani Shapiro has the perfect writing prompt for you. In an interview, she shared two words that instantly help banish writer\u2019s block,\n\nMy favorite prompt is based on a book that was published a long time ago by a writer named Joe Brainard, and the title is \u2018I Remember\u2019\u2026In the book every single sentence begins with the phrase, \u201cI remember.\u201d \u2026When I give that exercise at retreats, I look out from where I\u2019m sitting at a sea of people, and not one of them hesitates. Those are extremely evocative words. I mean, try not to finish a sentence that begins with \u201cI remember.\u201d And so what I suggest to people to do is to just begin \u2014 have a special notebook, begin with the words \u201cI remember\u201d and write a sentence. Drop down a line, begin with [\u201cI remember\u201d], not trying to connect memories. If you think about the way memory works, it doesn\u2019t work in a narrative line. It doesn\u2019t connect. We don\u2019t tell ourselves stories in our heads. We have these disparate memories that don\u2019t connect. And when we allow them to be associative and to bounce one off the next, it creates all sorts of interesting material. People almost invariably find memories that they didn\u2019t know that they had, or they make connections that they didn\u2019t know they had. So it\u2019s a good springing off point.\n\nYou can use this prompt to spark ideas for anything from blog posts to short stories. I share more strategies for fighting writer\u2019s block in my article here, and I share tips for getting ideas for new blog posts in my article here.\n\nThe Robert McKee Exercise For Writing With Originality\n\nRobert McKee\u2019s screenwriting workshops have earned him an international reputation. His screenwriting students have included over sixty-five Academy Award winners and two hundred Emmy Award winners.\n\nI\u2019m currently rereading his wonderful book Story where he deep dives into everything that you need to know to write powerful stories. In one chapter, he discusses the importance of originality in storytelling and how clich\u00e9s make our writing shallow and boring. He writes,\n\nThe source of all clich\u00e9s can be traced to one thing and one thing alone: The writer does not know the world of his story\u2026 As they reach into their minds for material, they come up empty. So where do they run? To films and TV, novels and plays with similar settings. From the works of other writers they crib scenes we\u2019ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we\u2019ve heard before, disguise characters we\u2019ve met before, and pass them off as their own\u2026 Knowledge of and insight into the world of your story is fundamental to the achievement of originality and excellence.\n\nBut how can we come to know the world of our stories better?\n\nHere\u2019s one exercise McKee provides:\n\nLean back and ask, \u201cWhat would it be like to live my character\u2019s life hour by hour, day by day?\u201d In vivid detail sketch how your characters shop, make love, pray \u2014 scenes that may or may not find their way into your story, but draw you into your imagined world until it feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. While memory gives us whole chunks of life, imagination takes fragments, slivers of dream, and chips of experience that seem unrelated, then seeks their hidden connections and merges them into a whole. Having found these links and envisioned the scenes, write them down. A working imagination is research.\n\nThe Brian Kiteley Exercise for Writing Unique, Sensory Descriptions\n\nFinally, let\u2019s end with an exercise that will help us write unique, sensory descriptions so our writing comes alive.\n\nThe ability to describe something vividly is an essential skill for every writer to master, no matter whether you\u2019re a blogger, novelist, or copywriter. Vivid descriptions transform your paragraphs from vague and boring to engrossing and memorable.\n\nIn his book The 3 A.M. Epiphany, author Brian Kiteley shares a collection of \u201cuncommon writing exercises\u201d that can help you transform your fiction.\n\nHere\u2019s one that gives a unique approach for writing evocative descriptions:\n\nSynesthesia, according to M.H. Abrams in \u2018A Glossary of Literary Terms\u2019, is a description of \u201cone kind of sensation in terms of another; color is attributed to sounds, odor to colors, sound to odors, and so on.\u201d Here is an example of synesthesia from Bruno Schulz\u2019s Street of the Crocodiles: \u201cAdela would plunge the rooms into semidarkness by drawing down the linen blinds. All colors immediately fell an octave lower; the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to the bottom of the sea and the light was reflected in mirrors of green water.\u201d Schulz describes a change in color by means of a musical term. Writers consciously and unconsciously employ this peculiar method to convey the irreducible complexity of life onto the page. \u2026Use synesthesia in a short scene \u2014 surreptitiously, without drawing too much attention to it \u2014 to convey to your reader an important understanding of some ineffable sensory experience. Use sight, sound, touch, taste, and, especially, smell.\n\nIn my short story \u201cThe Island\u201d, I played with synesthesia when I described the aroma of a pastry baking in an oven: \u201cIt smelled of sunlight and warm breezes rustling the branches of island trees.\u201d\n\nMake sure to check out this article where I share three more techniques that will help you write vivid descriptions.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIn my original article where I shared five writing exercises, I also shared this quote from Ray Bradbury,\n\nI know you\u2019ve heard it a thousand times before. But it\u2019s true \u2014 hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice.\n\nThese four exercises are a fantastic way to give your writing skills and imagination a workout.\n\nYou can use the exercises when you\u2019re feeling stuck and are looking for a writing prompt to trigger your inspiration. Or you can use them when you want to spend time sharpening your skills in order to take your writing to the next level and inspire your readers.",

        "title": "Facing Three Fundamental Coronavirus Fears",
        "text": "1. Since immunity to the novel coronavirus may not last long, doesn\u2019t the virus need to be eradicated in order for the pandemic to end?\n\nHumans generally become immune to a pathogen after immunization or recovery from an infection. Depending on the particular disease or vaccine as well as host characteristics such as the age and health of the individual, immunity can last a lifetime or may be short-lived. Moreover, immunity is not an \u2018either/or\u2019 process. Our immunity to different pathogens doesn\u2019t just suddenly switch off. Instead, it wanes over time.\n\nIt is true that a person\u2019s immunity to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, probably only lasts a few months to a few years. It is also true that outbreaks of two other coronaviruses earlier this century, SARS and MERS, were indeed contained, although not technically eradicated. However, the other four known human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1, are considered endemic. These viruses, which have been around longer than the other three, are continuously circulating through the population and typically cause no more symptoms than the common cold.\n\nInterestingly, there is historical evidence that the four endemic coronaviruses were likely the cause of pandemics, or at least epidemics, in the past. Of course, this would have been long enough ago that people didn\u2019t know what a coronavirus was, but humankind managed to recover anyway. These older coronaviruses now permeate among the population. People often become exposed at a young age, and, as with SARS-CoV-2, the vast majority of children have no symptoms or a minor respiratory infection. Even though immunity to these viruses diminishes over time, because they are endemic and continuously circulate through the population, every few years our immune systems are again exposed and receive a refresher course on how to kill the virus.\n\nWith possible exception to geographically isolated locations like Iceland and New Zealand, SARS-CoV-2 is on a path to becoming endemic like its older endemic coronavirus siblings. In fact, since March, for most regions containment has no longer been a strategy for managing SARS-CoV-2 as it was during the previous SARS and MERS outbreaks. SARS and MERS have a higher fatality rate than Covid-19, and it is for that very reason they were able to be contained. Since patients infected with SARS and MERS were more often symptomatic, generally developed more severe symptoms, and had a shorter period of time between exposure and the onset of symptoms, cases were recognized sooner, contacts were more easily traced, and further spread was prevented through quarantining.\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus is spreading too rapidly, and too broadly for the U.S. to bring it under control with testing and contact tracing.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC Deputy Director, 6/29/20\n\nWhile contact tracing and quarantining strategies remain important during the Covid-19 pandemic, they are aimed at protecting vulnerable groups and reducing the overall transmission of the virus rather than ultimately containing or eradicating the virus. At this point eliminating SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is essentially impossible. Fortunately, however, as was the case with the four endemic coronaviruses, eradication is not a requirement for the pandemic to end.",

        "title": "For Creatives, Silence Isn\u2019t Always Golden",
        "text": "As an architect and the author of a book about the psychology of creative space design, I have long wondered why contemporary creatives cluster so willingly in noisy coffee shops. Granted, there\u2019s scientific research that caffeine fuels the imagination, but doesn\u2019t the surrounding din interfere with their ability to think creatively such that no amount of chemical stimulation can compensate for the distraction?\n\nCertainly, many eminent creatives from the past shunned clamor. Consider Marcel Proust. To remark that the French writer was sensitive to auditory interference would be an understatement. The man was positively neurotic about it. He treated the bedroom in his Paris apartment where he wrote like a sensory deprivation chamber \u2014 shutters closed, drapes drawn, the walls lined with sound-absorbing cork. It wasn\u2019t enough. He wore earplugs too.\n\nAnton Chekhov was similarly beset by hypersensitivity to sound. So was fellow obsessive Frank Kafka, who described his condition in his signature surreal style by saying that \u201cI need solitude for my writing; not \u2018like a hermit\u2019 \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be enough \u2014 but like a dead man.\u201d Sadly, by the time he got his wish, it was too late to do anything about it.\n\nThe correlation between high-level inventiveness and difficulty in filtering out sensory inputs is understandable, given that open-mindedness is a hallmark of the creative personality. The problem for off-the-chart geniuses like Proust, Chekhov, and Kafka was that their minds were a bit too open. Everything got through. Hence the extreme measures they took to avoid being immobilized by incoming stimuli.\n\nFig. 1: Optimal noise levels for creative processing compared to other conditions. After Ravi Mehta, Rui (Juliet) Zhu, and Amar Cheema (2012). Illustration by the author. From My Creative Space: How to Design Your Home to Stimulate Ideas and Spark Innovation.\n\nThen again, most of us aren\u2019t Marcel Proust. According to research data from 2012, people generally reach peak performance under moderately noisy conditions \u2014 70db (decibels), to be precise. It just so happens that this is roughly equivalent to the chatter in a typical coffee shop or restaurant on a relatively busy day (Fig. 1).\n\nAs to why this is the case, the scientists who authored the study offer a theory:\n\nWe theorize that a moderate (vs. low) level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty, which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance. A high level of noise, however, reduces the extent of information processing, thus impairing creativity.\n\nTranslation: silence isn\u2019t as golden as it sounds. Absolute noiselessness tends to focus our attention, which is helpful for tasks that entail accuracy, fine detail, and linear reasoning, such as balancing our checkbook or fixing a Swiss watch. It\u2019s less supportive of the broad, big-picture, abstract mind-wandering that leads to fresh perspectives and a creative work product. On the other hand, excessive noise overwhelms our sensory apparatus and hinders our ability to properly process information at all. In between lies the sweet spot \u2014 noise not so loud that we can\u2019t hear ourselves think, and not so quiet that we can\u2019t help but hear ourselves think.\n\nLiving room and fountain details. Bellevue, Washington. Architecture by David Coleman Architecture. Interior design by Elizabeth Stretch for Stretch Design. Photography by Paul Warchol.\n\nThere\u2019s a caveat to the data, however: the noise has to be white. For the record, the technical definition of white noise is noise containing multiple frequencies with equal intensities. More colloquially, the phrase refers to a constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds, and which takes the form of meaningless or distracting commotion, hubbub, or chatter.\n\nWhy is it important that the noise be white? Because otherwise you\u2019re prone to tune into and attempt to discern the source and meaning of the sound, which diverts too much of your conscious attention from your task to be a useful tool for diffuse thinking.\n\nHow to Make Noise When There Isn\u2019t Any\n\nHow can we creative mortals who don\u2019t care for the smell of coffee, lack the funds to construct an oceanside villa, or live in urban environments where trees are scant benefit from the finding that a particular type and level of noise can promote insights? Here are a few options to consider:\n\nGet the app. Yes, Virginia, there really is an app for everything. Use the search term \u201cnoise\u201d to bring up dozens of sound generating programs in your smartphone\u2019s app store. You\u2019ll also see a broad selection of metering apps for measuring decibel levels at home.\n\nSome of the app companies operate websites that let you download audio files of white noise soundtracks onto your computer or play them directly through a browser. A couple of my favorite sites include Raining.fm, which offers tracks simulating \u2014 what else? \u2014 downpours, rolling thunder, and heavy thunderstorms, and Coffitivy, which specializes in \u2014 what else? \u2014 coffee shop buzz.\n\nLiving room. Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Architecture and interior design by Richard Davignon and Doris Martin for Davignon Martin Architecture + Interior Design. Photography by Eymeric Widling.\n\nGet or hack a sound generator. Another option is to purchase a desktop appliance designed to emit white noise. They\u2019re smallish devices, typically placed on night tables and in babies\u2019 rooms to help occupants fall asleep. For an architectural solution, think about installing an indoor or outdoor fountain \u2014 few things in life are as pleasantly hypnotizing as the mellifluous whoosh of water descending onto water. Price points run the gamut from low-cost store-bought products to sky\u2019s-the-limit custom installations.\n\nDIY contrivances also abound; consult the Internet for guidance.\n\nLet in or keep out external noise. City dwellers and people who reside along busy highways might have a ready-made noise machine right outside their window: road traffic. Open your windows to varying degrees or use sound muffling, such as drapery, to see if you can calibrate ambient noise to fall within the optimal range.\n\nA less cacophonous strategy for harnessing exterior sounds would be to park yourself on a bench or beach that lies within earshot of ocean waves. It\u2019s like having an always-on fountain, only bigger.\n\nListen to music. Like noise, music can have a positive effect on idea formation, while affording the listener far greater pleasure than the usual restaurant ruckus. But music is a huge subject in itself, and so must wait for another article!",

        "title": "This 10-Minute Routine Will Increase Your Clarity And Creativity",
        "text": "\u201cYour subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and while you sleep.\u201d \u2014 Napoleon Hill\n\nYour subconscious never rests and is always on duty because it controls your heartbeat, blood circulation, and digestion. It controls all the vital processes and functions of your body and knows the answers to all your problems.\n\nWhat happens on your subconscious level influences what happens on your conscious level. In other words, what goes on internally, even unconsciously, eventually becomes your reality. As Hill further states, \u201cThe subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, by the most direct and practical method available.\u201d\n\nConsequently, your goal is to direct your subconscious mind to create the outcomes you seek. Additionally, you want to tap into your subconscious mind to unlock connections and solutions to your problems and projects.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple routine to get started:\n\nTen minutes before going to sleep:\n\n\u201cNever go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.\u201d \u2014 Thomas Edison\n\nIt\u2019s common practice for many of the world\u2019s most successful people to intentionally direct the workings of their subconscious mind while they\u2019re sleeping.\n\nHow?\n\nTake a few moments before you go to bed to meditate on and write down the things you\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n\nAsk yourself loads of questions related to that thing. In Edison\u2019s words, make some \u201crequests.\u201d Write those questions and thoughts down on paper. The more specific the questions, the more clear will be your answers.\n\nWhile you\u2019re sleeping, your subconscious mind will get to work on those things.\n\nTen minutes after waking up:\n\nResearch confirms the brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, is most active and readily creative immediately following sleep. Your subconscious mind has been loosely mind-wandering while you slept, making contextual and temporal connections. Creativity, after all, is making connections between different parts of the brain.\n\nIn a recent interview with Tim Ferriss, Josh Waitzkin, former chess prodigy and tai chi world champion, explains his morning routine to tap into the subconscious breakthroughs and connections experienced while he was sleeping.\n\nUnlike 80 percent of people between the ages of 18\u201344 who check their smartphones within 15 minutes of waking up, Waitzkin goes to a quiet place, does some meditation and grabs his journal.\n\nIn his journal, he thought-dumps for several minutes. Thus, rather than focusing on input like most people who check their notifications, Waitzkin\u2019s focus is on output. This is how he taps into his higher realms of clarity, learning, and creativity \u2014 what he calls, \u201ccrystallized intelligence.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not an experienced journal writer, the idea of \u201cthought-dumping\u201d may be hard to implement. In my experience, it\u2019s good to loosely direct your thought-dumping toward your goals.\n\nConsider the \u201crequests\u201d you made of your subconscious just before going to bed. You asked yourself loads of questions. You thought about and wrote down the things you\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n\nNow, first thing in the morning, when your creative brain is most attuned,after its subconscious workout while you slept, start writing down whatever comes to mind about those things.\n\nI often get ideas for articles I\u2019m going to write while doing these thought-dumps. I get ideas about how I can be a better husband and father to my three foster children. I get clarity about the goals I believe I should be pursuing. I get insights about people I need to connect with, or how I can improve my current relationships.\n\nTo be sure, you\u2019ll need to practice this skill. It may take several attempts before you become proficient. But with consistency, you can become fluent and automatic at achieving creative and intuitive bursts.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\u201cA man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.\u201d \u2014 James Allen\n\nMental creation always precedes physical creation. Before a building is physically constructed, there\u2019s a blueprint.\n\nYour thoughts are the blueprint of the life you are building one day at a time.When you learn to channel your thinking \u2014 both consciously and subconsciously \u2014 you create the conditions that make the achievement of your goals inevitable.\n\nYou are the designer of your destiny. This simple routine will help you crystallize where you want to go, and how you will get there.",

        "text": "The Simplest Form of Mindfulness Is Also the Most Effective\n\nMost of us are cognitively aware that our bad habits are, well, BAD. The challenge is that our prefrontal cortex (front section of the brain) that is responsible for this awareness is the first to go offline when we get stressed. When this brain center logs off, we start to feel \u2018numb\u2019, give in to our stress, and fall back onto negative habits.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the 3 pillars that form a habit one more time.

Here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\nYou feel a trigger that spurs temptation. Instead of caving in, you pause for a moment and get curious. Ask yourself\u2026what\u2019s going on? Why am I feeling this way?\n\nFrom here you have two possible routes, both of which are a step in the right direction. The first path is that you still give in to your bad behavior, but with a heightened state of mindfulness. The act of caving in feels much less satisfying. You become consciously aware that the reward is just a guise covering up the reality that you\u2019re in an endless loop of going nowhere.\n\nIn one of Brewers\u2019s studies, a subject involved with smoking admitted that mindful smoking, \u201csmells like stinky cheese, and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!\u201d. This paper eventually reveals that mindfulness training may confer benefits greater than those associated with current standard treatments for smoking cessation. No money, drugs, or therapy required.\n\nThe second route is when things get really exciting. This is when you experience the trigger, but you\u2019re now inherently aware that this is a poor choice and you take a halt.\n\nThis is how you move from knowledge to wisdom. We\u2019re all cognitively aware that bad habits aren\u2019t good for us. Curiosity bridges the gap to allow us to be mindful of this, even when we\u2019re stressed out or \u2018in the act\u2019.\n\nWhen you start to implement this curiosity technique into your behaviors, bad habits simply become less enchanting. You start to wise up and realize that you don\u2019t need to give in to every trigger that comes your way. An amazing bonus to this mindset is that curiosity in itself is rewarding. Being mindful amidst your stressed-out state will deliver the prize that you were initially seeking from your \u2018drug\u2019 of choice. It may not be as powerful of a hit, but over time, your brain will realize that it\u2019s the one you need.\n\nThis is a rewarding, sustainable, and life-changing way to think about human behavior. Will it solve all of your problems instantly? Absolutely not. Many addictions are as much physiological as they are psychological. At times, it may be necessary to get professional help. Regardless, this is a powerful tool for initiating an important conversation with yourself. It is one that empowers you to ditch the dissociation and start attacking your bad habits head-on.",

        "title": "How to Make Your Day Job Support Your Art",
        "text": "Gather around kids and let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, people grew up and got one job that paid all of their bills, let them save some money, and was enough to do big things like buy a house and put their kids through college.\n\nOnce upon a time, that was just what happened. It\u2019s sometimes called the American Dream, but it was just reality. Weird, I know. For the rest of this post I\u2019m going to talk about a day job, but what I mean is whatever income streams you\u2019ve cobbled together to pay for your life.\n\nAnd even weirder if you\u2019re an artist of any kind who has it in their head that you\u2019re supposed to figure out how to make your art give you that kind of life.\n\nThe idea that your art has to be the kind of pillar of your financial life that that barely even exists in the corporate world anymore is a dream killer.\n\nYou aren\u2019t a failure if your art doesn\u2019t let you quit your day job.\n\nOne more time for the people who really need to hear it.\n\nYou aren\u2019t a failure if your art doesn\u2019t let you quit your day job.\n\nAnd that day job? It will suck a lot less if you can wrap your head around the idea that it\u2019s serving your art.\n\nSeriously. If you can make yourself believe that the idea that showing up for your 9-to-5 is part of your art, it will change everything.\n\nIt will knock your day job off its pedestal and it will relieve your art of the pressure to pay its own way. And it will crack your brain open so that the idea of building a living around your art, instead of feeling like a failure if your art doesn\u2019t pull in enough money all by itself, can take root.\n\nStart by prioritizing your art.\n\nIf you have a regular job, chances are there are hours in your day that you don\u2019t have control over. That\u2019s okay. We ALL have hours during the day we don\u2019t have control over.\n\nEven full-time artists who earn a living with their art.\n\nGet a calendar though, an agenda of some kind, and schedule your art like it\u2019s important enough for you to show up for. If you wouldn\u2019t blow off working for someone else, don\u2019t blow off working on your art.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: you don\u2019t have to put eight hours a day into it. But I bet you can find an hour a day, five days a week. Start there. Write it in and protect that time like there\u2019s a boss who will dock your check if you don\u2019t show up.\n\nThink outside the 9-to-5 box.\n\nBrainstorm how you can make your day job work around your art, instead of the other way around.\n\nAre there income streams you can build that will let you work fewer hours?\n\nCan you find work that will free up more of your emotional and physical energy for your art?\n\nHow about focusing on finding a job that pays more per hour so that you can make the same money in fewer hours, and open up time for your art?\n\nIs there some aspect of your art that you can turn into an income? Think about teaching, blogging, freelancing.\n\nInstead of fitting your art into your day job, shift your thinking so that you\u2019re building a life around your art.\n\nBuild an audience.\n\nA couple of years ago I set up a little corner of a shared booth at a tiny local comic con to spread the word about Ninja Writers.\n\nI was surrounded by artists of all stripes. Writers. Comic book creators. A girl who made tote bags out of Doctor Who and Star Wars fabric. A man who sat in his booth all day and drew superheroes.\n\nI sat there with my little poster promising to give away a $25 Amazon gift card to one of people who gave me their email address \u2014 and I realized that literally no one else around me was collecting email addresses.\n\nA few passed out postcards or bookmarks with their website addresses. Those disappeared into bags full of similar ephemera. I talked to as many as I could and tried to encourage them to collect email addresses from the people who were stopping to talk to them.\n\nI handed out my business card and told them that I\u2019d be happy to help them learn how to build an email list if they emailed me.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. The few people who did take my business card didn\u2019t use it to contact me. I haven\u2019t heard from any of them.\n\nArtists need audiences.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what your art is. Writing, painting, sculpture, theater, making TARDIS tote bags. If you are an artist of any kind, you need an audience.\n\nI can tell you from experience that even having some big producer of your art get involved does not guarantee you an audience. Ask anyone whose had a film flop, an art show fail to result in sales, a restaurant go bust.\n\nAsk me sometime about how being published by Penguin worked out for me.\n\nArtists need audiences, and no one else will build them for us. When you are ready to make the move to making some of your income from your art, you\u2019ll need people who care about what you\u2019re doing.\n\nThe one thing you can do is start building an email list. Get a free MailChimp account. Or just start writing names and emails in a notebook. Send everyone two emails a month. In one talk about cool shit you\u2019ve come across that you think they might like. In the other talk about what you\u2019re working on.\n\nMake a habit of asking everyone if they want to join your list. It\u2019ll feel weird at first, but you\u2019ll get used to it.\n\nYour day job is the first investor in your art.\n\nTrue story.\n\nIf you have a day job that pays your bills, then it\u2019s paying for your supplies, it\u2019s putting a roof over your head, it\u2019s feeding you. Maybe it\u2019s paying for you to take some classes so you can learn to be a better artist.\n\nSeriously. Your day job is like having patron. Sure you have to work for it. You have to put in the time to get the pay check. And maybe that sucks. I\u2019ve had jobs that really, really sucked. I know that place.\n\nWhen you have a day job like that, sometimes the only thing that helps is shifting your mindset.\n\nInstead of: I can\u2019t be a writer because I have to work 40 hours a week at this shitty job that I hate and it sucks all my creative energy.\n\nTry this: I spend 40 hours a week at a shitty job that I hate, but it pays for me to spend 20 hours a week writing.\n\nOr even better: I\u2019m grateful for this day job that pays my bills so that I can be a writer.\n\nGive your art a break.\n\nThe best gift you can give yourself as an artist is to stop expecting your art to support itself. Especially if you\u2019re still learning.\n\nMaybe your art will earn a living someday. It\u2019s unreasonable to put that burden on it when it\u2019s still a baby venture and you\u2019re still learning how to create it.\n\nI know so many writers who put everything inside them into writing a book. They shine it up and send it off to agents \u2014 as they should. And when rejection comes \u2014 as it always will \u2014 they are crushed. Absolutely devastated.\n\nSo devastated that sometimes they just stop writing. What\u2019s the point if it\u2019s never going to make money? Obviously, if this one book failed then they suck and they just aren\u2019t really writers anyway.\n\nDon\u2019t do that to yourself. Please.\n\nEmbrace your day job. It has one job. Paying your bills. Let your writing (or whatever your art is) off the hook. Just create. Practice. Take in the masters. Learn to be better.\n\nCome back and talk to me when you\u2019re ten books in about whether or not you should pack it in.",

        "title": "A Social Worker Offered Mormon Lingo to Me When I Was in Crisis, Told Me to Think Happy Thoughts, and Hung Up on Me \u2014 While I Was Still in Crisis",
        "text": "A Social Worker Offered Mormon Lingo to Me When I Was in Crisis, Told Me to Think Happy Thoughts, and Hung Up on Me \u2014 While I Was Still in Crisis Rhett Wilkinson Follow May 26, 2019 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nI called a crisis line. You may say it was tragically less than helpful. In fact, it only made the situation worse. The issue was created by a social worker on the other end of the Utah County Crisis Line.\n\n(United Way of Utah County)\n\nImmediately after telling her I am considering killing myself, this person talked about \u201cthe other side.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not against talk about heaven, but \u201cthe other side\u201d comes ripped from language used in culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nWhich still would not be bad, except that she is not speaking organically. Not from the heart. When I was suicidal.\n\nFurther, she did nothing more than parrot what the system she is in fed her.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what she had to offer above anything else when I wanted nothing more than to die.\n\nThen she went on to talk about thinking positive thoughts. I do know social work well enough that least to know that simply thinking positive thoughts doesn\u2019t help anyone depressed, let alone suicidal. And in fact, that patients should be encouraged to grieve. (Not to say that she said nothing about medications or even exercise, let alone yoga.)\n\n(Perhaps this photo expresses Latter-day Saint culture well.) A crisis worker offered Mormon lingo immediately after I told her I was considering killing myself and proceeded to give an idea prevalent in LDS culture about thinking \u201cpositive thoughts.\u201d\n\nAnother example of her just parroting an idea fed to her by culture, instead of doing the work of life-saving.\n\nSo then I got at these ideas. I said that I had compassion for how she was handling the call since her thoughts are not her own since she is part of a cult. Her response?\n\nHang up.\n\nOn someone who may kill themselves?\n\nAnd she said she has been a social worker for 15 years.\n\nHow often, then, did she miss out on helping folks in real pain? How much did she simply drop the ball? Has she fallen short for years?\n\nPerhaps this is why the recording to start the call to the Utah County Crisis Line emphasizes that the social workers are volunteering.\n\nPerhaps, though, even those not getting paid should be kept from life-saving circumstances if they are going to drop the ball so bad.\n\nThe Utah County Crisis Line has a tagline of \u201cLet us be your lifeline.\u201d Hopefully at least not this lady any longer.\n\n\u2014\n\nEven if you no longer affiliate with the Latter-day Saint (ex-Mormon) church but enjoy sociality with family and friends as before, you can still find social settings organized by the Utah Valley PostMormons. There, you can find your people. And of course, if you don\u2019t enjoy those relationships like before, the many UVPM events that happen each week can be even life-saving.\n\nLed by wonderful people, UVPM is also for folks who just are struggling with it or are \u201cnever Mormons\u201d seeking a break from the predominant culture. Find their events on Facebook and Meetup.\n\n\u2014\n\nFor more articles like this, please support The Seer Stone at the Hero\u2019s Journey Content Patreon page.",

        "title": "An Effective Five-Step Process for Writing Captivating Headlines",
        "text": "You\u2019ve spent hours pouring your heart and soul into a blog post.\n\nYou\u2019re writing about an important topic that you\u2019re sure will help readers, and you want to convey your message as effectively as possible.\n\nSo you\u2019ve edited each paragraph until your eyes ached from staring at the computer screen. You\u2019ve crafted a compelling introduction that will entice readers to keep reading, and your conclusion is powerful with a memorable final sentence.\n\nUnfortunately, however, all of this time and effort will go to waste if no one reads your article.\n\nOften, there\u2019s only one way to get people to read: you must craft a headline that is so irresistible it draws people like a magnet to click on your piece.\n\nPeople\u2019s social media feeds are flooded with a constant stream of articles and online content. If you don\u2019t have an attention-grabbing headline, your post won\u2019t reach the potential readers it could help and inspire.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry!\n\nIn today\u2019s article, I\u2019m sharing my five-step process that will help you write captivating headlines so your target audience reads your valuable blog posts.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n(Please note that links to books are affiliate links which means I\u2019ll earn a small commission if you buy through the link with no extra cost to you.)\n\n1. Craft a one sentence synopsis\n\nWhen I begin working on a new writing project, the very first thing I do is write up a one-sentence synopsis of what my piece will be about. I do this no matter if I\u2019m about to write a blog post, a personal essay, or even a short story.\n\nThe one-sentence synopsis gives me a clear understanding of the main point of my piece and the message I\u2019m trying to express to my readers. It acts as a guide so I don\u2019t end up running off on tangents and going down rabbit trails.\n\nAnd often it can be tweaked to become a perfect title for the piece too.\n\nFor example, for this article my synopsis was: \u201cMy five-step process that will help readers craft captivating headlines.\u201d\n\nI tweaked that sentence to get my headline: \u201cA Powerful Five-Step Process for Writing Captivating Headlines.\u201d\n\nNow, as I said, I don\u2019t only use the one-sentence synopsis for blog posts. I recently wrote a personal essay titled \u201cWhat a Museum Security Guard Taught Me About Art.\u201d That title came straight from a one-sentence synopsis I\u2019d crafted too.\n\nIn my article here, I dive deeper into how to craft a one-sentence synopsis and share five different formulas that can help you write yours.\n\nLet\u2019s now see how to go about tweaking your synopsis in order to turn it into a powerful headline.\n\n2. Identify Your SEO Keyword\n\nMy second step when crafting a headline for a blog post is to identify the keyword that I want my blog post to be categorized under in Google searches.\n\nIn blogging parlance, this is called \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d or SEO. If you have a blog and don\u2019t bother at all about SEO, you probably won\u2019t end up reaching readers who might have found you through Google.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not worried about SEO, choosing a clear keyword will help people better understand what your piece is about and help you avoid titles that sound like clickbait.\n\nFor example, compare the difference between titling your piece \u201cThis One Habit Changed My Life\u201d (sounds a bit like clickbait) or \u201cHow Journaling in the Morning Changed My Life\u201d. \u201cJournaling\u201d would be your keyword for that title.\n\nHere\u2019s how to figure out what keyword to use for your piece:\n\nTake a look at your one-sentence synopsis. What is your piece about?\n\nIs there a word you use multiple times in your piece to refer to your topic?\n\nWhat terms might someone be searching for in Google to find your piece?\n\nSearch for blog posts similar to yours. What keywords are used in the titles?\n\n3. Tweak Your Headline to Include Specificity, Curiosity, and Power Words\n\nOnce I\u2019ve crafted my one-sentence synopsis, written my blog post, and then pinpointed my keyword, I write up a quick first draft of a headline to work with.\n\nLet\u2019s take, for example, the blog post I wrote about my two different journaling methods. A rough draft of a title might have looked like this: \u201cA Peek At My Two Journaling Methods.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not very compelling, right?\n\nIt\u2019s time to tweak that headline to make sure it stands out and entices people to click to read the article.\n\nThere are three ingredients that copywriters use to write effective headlines: specificity, curiosity, and power words.\n\nFirst, specificity makes your headline focused and compelling. In his classic book Scientific Advertising, copywriter Claude C. Hopkins explained why \u201cspecificity\u201d is persuasive:\n\n\u201c\u2026[A] man who makes a specific claim is either telling the truth or a lie. People do not expect an advertiser to lie \u2026 The weight of an argument may often be multiplied by making it specific.\u201d\n\nNow, you\u2019re probably not selling a product in your blog post, but you most likely are trying to convince your readers of an idea or to take a certain course of action. Specificity will increase your credibility.\n\nFor example, instead of writing, \u201cI Lost Weight on a Low Carb Diet\u201d, you could write \u201cHow I Lost Five Pounds in Two Weeks on a Low Carb Diet.\u201d\n\nThat word \u201chow\u201d indicates your blog post is going to share a specific process you followed. The numbers make your headline sound truthful.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll lose your credibility if the body of your post doesn\u2019t deliver what the headline promised. If your headline promises to share a specific process, make sure you do so in the body of your post.\n\nHere are ways to make your headlines specific:\n\nStart your headline with a number (for example, \u201c5 Steps to Quickly Memorize Any Piano Piece\u201d)\n\nStart your headline with words like \u201cwho, what, why, when, where, or how\u201d (for example, \u201cHow to Make A Perfect Pan Seared Steak Every Time\u201d)\n\nUse specific words like \u201cThis\u201d or \u201cThese\u201d (for example, \u201cThis Powerful Strategy Will Boost Your Productivity\u201d)\n\nUse specific numbers in the body of your headline (for example, one of my most popular posts on Medium is \u201cHow to Make Your Writing Captivating with One Simple Technique\u201d)\n\nSpecificity also piques readers\u2019 curiosity, which is the next ingredient for strengthening your headline.\n\nIf a headline arouses a person\u2019s curiosity, they\u2019re probably going to keep reading. So make sure you don\u2019t just summarize your piece in the headline.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m not piquing someone\u2019s curiosity if I write a title like this: \u201cKeeping a Journal Will Make You More Productive\u201d.\n\nCompare it to this one: \u201c5 Reasons Why Keeping a Journal Will Make You More Productive\u201d.\n\nFinally, take your headline to the next level by using power words.\n\nPower words are words that trigger an emotional response. They might be a strong adjective or adverb or a more descriptive verb.\n\nFor example, instead of writing, \u201cincrease your productivity\u201d, you could write, \u201cboost your productivity\u201d or even \u201csupercharge your productivity.\u201d\n\nIn my headlines, I use words like \u201ccompelling\u201d and \u201ccaptivating.\u201d A food blogger might use words like \u201crefreshing\u201d, \u201ctasty\u201d, or \u201cdelicious.\u201d\n\nWhen you evaluate your headline, ask yourself if you could include a vivid adjective or a more emotional verb.\n\n4. Convey a benefit to the reader\n\nLastly, your headline should appeal to the reader\u2019s self-interest. It should promise them something in return for the time they spend reading.\n\nDavid Ogilvy, known as The Father of Advertising, is said to have stated,\n\n\u201cThe headlines that work best are those that promise the reader a benefit.\u201d\n\nA benefit could be anything from entertaining someone to teaching someone to inspiring someone to helping someone solve a problem.\n\nWhat is the benefit you\u2019re offering to a person for reading your blog post?\n\nWill you help them solve a problem? Earn money? Save money? Increase their productivity? Expand their knowledge? Become smarter? Happier? Avoid danger?\n\nMaybe they will learn a quick and effortless method for accomplishing something? Or discover a secret or a strategy?\n\nDepending on the type of blog post you\u2019re writing, you might want the promise in your headline to be very clear or perhaps more subtle. For example, my personal essay\u2019s title \u201cWhat a Museum Security Guard Taught Me About Art\u201d was focused on me rather than on the reader. However, it did promise that I was going to share the security guard\u2019s wisdom with them.\n\nBut when I wrote the headline for my blog post about my journaling methods, I wanted the benefit to be very clear. I decided to go with \u201cTwo Journaling Methods to Boost Your Productivity and Creativity\u201d rather than \u201cTwo Journaling Methods That Boost My Productivity and Creativity.\u201d The latter is not as powerful at hooking the reader.\n\n5. Write Multiple Headlines\n\nEven the best copywriters in the world usually don\u2019t write a captivating headline right off the bat. In the book Tested Advertising Methods, expert copywriter John Caples says he writes between twelve to twenty-five headlines before choosing the best one.\n\nSometimes I will change the headline of a post after I\u2019ve published it if I notice that it isn\u2019t getting a lot of clicks.\n\nSo experiment and tweak your headlines as much as you can. Write out a list of different headlines you can use for your piece.\n\nHeadline formulas are a fantastic way to remind yourself to include all of the essential copywriting elements covered in steps 3 and 4. You can find these formulas in copywriting books or in countless articles online. Here are several examples:\n\nHow to Start____When____ (For example, \u201cHow to Start a Side Hustle When You\u2019re Broke\u201d)\n\n(For example, \u201cHow to Start a Side Hustle When You\u2019re Broke\u201d) Why____Makes You____ (\u201cWhy Reading Makes You a Better Writer\u201d)\n\n(\u201cWhy Reading Makes You a Better Writer\u201d) [Number] Mistakes People Make When____ (\u201c10 Mistakes People Make When Saving for Retirement\u201d)\n\n(\u201c10 Mistakes People Make When Saving for Retirement\u201d) The Ultimate Guide To____ (\u201cThe Ultimate Guide to Going Low Carb\u201d)\n\n(\u201cThe Ultimate Guide to Going Low Carb\u201d) [Number] Lessons I Learned From____ (\u201c5 Lessons I Learned from Waking up at 5am for 30 Days\u201d)\n\n(\u201c5 Lessons I Learned from Waking up at 5am for 30 Days\u201d) [Number] Strategies That Will Help You ____ (\u201c7 Strategies That Will Help You Improve Your Writing Skills\u201d)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve written the final version of your headline, evaluate it and ask yourself, \u201cIs this headline clear and easy to understand?

        "text": "Loss Aversion \u2014 how fear influences customer choice\n\nWhy the possibility of loss is one of the most potent psychological principles in marketing\n\nPhoto by Kristina Tripkovic on Unsplash\n\nHave you ever experienced FOMO \u2014 the \u201cFear of Missing Out\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s a form of social anxiety that makes people scared they\u2019re being left out of exciting or interesting events. It\u2019s usually triggered by posts on social media, where it looks like the whole world is having fun without you.\n\nIf you suffer from FOMO, you\u2019re not alone. A recent study found that 70% of millennials experience the fear of missing out regularly.\n\nThere\u2019s a profound psychological principle behind why people experience FOMO.\n\nIt\u2019s called Loss Aversion, and it can be a powerful design mechanism for guiding customer choice.\n\nPhoto by Noah Silliman on Unsplash\n\nWhat is Loss Aversion?\n\nFirst identified by Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahneman, Loss Aversion is a psychological principle that says people will go to great lengths to avoid losing.\n\nIn fact, the psychological pain of losing is twice as powerful as the pleasure of winning.\n\nBecause it\u2019s so powerful, Loss Aversion features heavily in cognitive psychology and decision theory. It\u2019s also one of the most effective tactics for getting customers to buy (the other being Social Proof).\n\nA customer\u2019s hatred of losing can take lots of forms, each with fascinating applications.\n\nHow information is presented can dramatically impact what decisions people make\n\n\u201cLosses loom larger than gains.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Kahneman\n\nPhoto by JC Gellidon on Unsplash\n\nFor example, a study was conducted to see if framing cancer treatments using Loss Aversion could improve surgery opt-in rates.\n\nThe research team hypothesized that opt-in rates were related to how the options were framed.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, doctors presented patients with two options. Each framed surgery as a potential gain or a possible loss \u2014 the results were staggering.\n\nSurgery framed as a gain: \u201cThe one-month survival rate of surgery is 90%.\u201d Surgery framed as a loss: \u201cThere is a 10% chance of death in the month post-surgery.\u201d\n\nWhen framed as a gain, 84% of people chose surgery. But when framed as a loss, only 50% opted in.\n\nThis simple application of Loss Aversion increased surgery opt-ins by 54%.\n\nOwnership creates emotional bonds that people don\u2019t want to break\n\nThis principle is known as the Endowment Effect. It\u2019s a psychological principle that falls under the Loss Aversion umbrella.\n\nIn \u201cPredictably Irrational,\u201d Dan Ariely describes this effect through the lens of Duke University basketball.\n\nPhoto by JC Gellidon on Unsplash\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Duke basketball, all you need to know is the Duke-UNC game is the biggest of the year. And that it takes place in an area of the country where basketball is a religion.\n\nTo score tickets to this game, students have to camp out for weeks. They then enter a lottery for a chance to win tickets.\n\nAriely reached out to students who won tickets and those who entered the lottery but didn\u2019t win. Both had invested the same amount of pain, sacrifice, time, and effort to enter the lottery. But some had won, and others hadn\u2019t.\n\nWould this affect how each group valued the basketball tickets?\n\nThe results were interesting. Students who were not successful in the lottery said they\u2019d pay an average of $170 for a ticket.\n\nBut the students who did get a ticket? When asked how much they\u2019d sell their ticket for, they asked 170% more for their ticket \u2014 about $2,400 on average.\n\nThe question is \u2014 why were the owners asking so much for their tickets?\n\nThe answer? Emotion.\n\nAccording to Ariely, once someone owns a product, they begin fantasizing about their future experiences. Once they create these \u201cpre-memories\u201d of the game, ticket-holders don\u2019t want to lose out.\n\nSo these students wouldn\u2019t only be selling a ticket. They\u2019d be losing out on potential memories, emotions, and good times.\n\nThe lesson \u2014 the more emotions associated with a product, the more people value it.",

        "title": "The FDA Banned These Chemicals \u2014 and They\u2019re Still Everywhere",
        "text": "The FDA Banned These Chemicals \u2014 and They\u2019re Still Everywhere\n\nAntibacterial compounds are no longer in your hand soap, but they\u2019re in your floors, your walls, and in your body.\n\nJust about two years ago, activists who work to reduce environmental contamination from hazardous chemicals were feeling pretty cheerful. After a struggle that had lasted decades, they\u2019d persuaded the Food and Drug Administration to ban a slate of antibacterial chemicals from soaps and bodywashes in the United States.\n\nThe rap on the chemicals \u2014 especially the best-known and most common ones on the list, triclosan and triclocarban \u2014 was that hundreds of pieces of scientific research revealed they did more harm than good to humans and to the environment. Mouse studies suggested that these bacteria-killing compounds might affect hormone production and damage the microbiome, and they appeared to contribute to antibiotic resistance. Moreover, cleansers with these chemicals were no better at killing infectious bugs than plain soap and water.\n\nThe ban on triclosan and triclocarban was an achievement, given that the FDA had been mulling it over since 1974. But it was only a partial victory. Triclosan and triclocarban are still dosed into the carpets we walk on, added to the household plastics we handle every day, and blended into the caulk in our bathrooms and the paint on our walls. They are routine ingredients in fabrics and plastics \u2014 and thus in floor wax, air-conditioning coils, kitchen tools, and kids\u2019 toys. Like a phone call in an old horror movie, triclosan and triclocarban are coming from inside the house.\n\nUnlike hand sanitizers and soaps, all these products fall under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), rather than the FDA. And the EPA has so far shown no signs of cracking down on their use.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of products outside of the FDA\u2019s regulatory reach that pose similar exposure and health threats,\u201d says Rolf Halden, director of the Biodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona State University, who began researching triclosan in 2002. He estimates that more than 2,000 common products sold in the United States still contain the compounds.\n\nLike a phone call in an old horror movie, triclosan and triclocarban are coming from inside the house.\n\nWhy dose your walls and carpets with antibacterials? To protect the objects themselves from attack by bacteria and mold, says Mae Wu, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which helped bring about the FDA ban by filing a lawsuit against the agency in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s impregnated in all these products as a preservative.\u201d\n\nIt might seem like a good thing to have walls that don\u2019t harbor bacteria and spatulas that gunk won\u2019t grow on. The problem, Wu said, is that the antibacterials don\u2019t stay bound up in the materials they have been added to. As those household products wear and decay, the compounds escape and find other things in your house to cling to. \u201cIt ends up in household dust,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s coming off your bathroom caulk, or off the mousepad you just bought.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s \u2026 everywhere\n\nLast year, Halden and more than 200 other scientists detailed the ongoing threats related to these disinfectants in a scientific paper that has come to be known as the Florence Statement, for the location of the conference where it was drafted. The statement cites almost 170 pieces of research in order to document the persistent hazards of triclosan and triclocarban. The compounds flow into wastewater, pile up in sewage (and contaminate crop fields when sewage sludge is used as fertilizer), persist in the soil, accumulate in aquatic plants, and collect in the flesh of fish and livestock.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a range of studies in the United States and in other countries have found traces of the chemical in human blood, urine, and breast milk. Over several decades, experiments in animals and observations in people show that in addition to interfering with hormone production, triclosan and triclocarban disrupt the endocrine system, damage heart muscle, affect the growth of fetuses, and may increase allergic reactions in children.\n\nThe compounds flow into wastewater, pile up in sewage, persist in the soil, accumulate in aquatic plants, and collect in the flesh of fish and livestock.\n\nThey may also contribute to one of the world\u2019s most pressing health threats. Microbiologists have long suspected that triclosan\u2019s ability to kill bacteria might create the same risks as the overuse of antibiotics. That is, a low or diluted dose might kill only the vulnerable bacteria, permitting bacteria that have developed defenses against the compounds to flourish and dominate. When that happens with antibiotics, the drugs became less and less useful as resistant bacteria take over. Antibiotic resistance kills an estimated 23,000 Americans and 700,000 people around the world each year.\n\nIn 2016, Halden and researchers from Harvard and the University of Oregon demonstrated that these disinfectants could make the problem of antibiotic resistance worse. They took samples of dust from indoor public spaces at their universities and subjected them to tests to reveal both the genetic and the chemical contents of the dust. The more triclosan there was in the dust, they found, the more antibiotic resistance bacterial genes the dust also contained. It suggests the disinfectant was influencing which bacteria survived and died. The alarming possibility: Triclosan may be changing the environmental microbiome and enriching it with bacteria that are potentially dangerous to human health.\n\nOther recent work demonstrates how these compounds may be affecting animal microbiomes, setting up the possibility that they could do the same to us. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts fed triclosan to mice, so that they developed a blood concentration equal to what many humans already carry. Those antibacterial loads devastated the mice\u2019s gut microbiomes, the mix of bacteria that help digest food, synthesize vitamins, and communicate to the immune system. The team reported in June that the mice that were fed triclosan experienced inflammation that could predispose them to other gut problems. In mice that had been engineered to have the equivalent of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer \u2014 conditions that many humans have \u2014 triclosan made those illnesses worse, with more cellular damage and larger tumors.\n\nThis precise effect had never been shown before. \u201cWe think our study suggests triclosan has previously unknown health risks,\u201d says Guodong Zhang, the paper\u2019s senior author and an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\nTo remove disinfectants, apply consumer pressure\n\nDespite these emerging risks, it\u2019s not at all clear that regulation of triclosan and triclocarban will change in the near term. The EPA last evaluated the chemicals in 2008. The agency usually reviews chemicals on a 15-year cycle but began another review of triclosan early, in 2013.\n\nSince then, of course, the government has changed hands, and so has leadership of the agency. Trump\u2019s pick for EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, resigned in July after several ethics controversies, and the agency is currently headed by an acting administrator, a situation in which the EPA is unlikely to take any big steps. A spokesperson told NEO.LIFE that the agency expects to complete its review next year.\n\nSome manufacturers are quietly changing their products\u2019 formulas to phase out the problem chemicals without advertising they have done so.\n\nWith further policy changes unlikely, advocates hope the market will speak instead. Arlene Blum, the executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute in Berkeley \u2014 which won a multi-year battle to get toxic flame retardants removed from fabrics \u2014 thinks the way to reduce disinfectant use lies in targeting big purchasers such as car manufacturers, home builders, and huge retail chains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for the government \u2014 EPA, the FDA \u2014 to move quickly, but manufacturers and retailers can,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to motivate big buyers and trade associations when money is on the line.\u201d\n\nThere is a precedent: Over the past four years, most poultry producers in the United States stopped routinely feeding antibiotics to their birds, largely because of consumer pressure from individuals and from big institutional buyers such as school systems and medical centers.\n\nAnd there are subtle signs of change. The advocacy group Beyond Pesticides maintains a list of consumer products that contain triclosan and triclocarban. In some cases, the group says, manufacturers are quietly changing their products\u2019 formulas to phase out the problem chemicals without advertising they have done so. Other manufacturers are explicitly embracing triclosan-free products: Halden is working with the Healthy Building Network, a research nonprofit that advocates for green and sustainable construction, to guide architects and materials manufacturers toward choosing components without these compounds.\n\nIf manufacturers stop adding triclosan and triclocarban to their products, the compounds in the environment now will slowly break down and disappear. As long as these chemicals aren\u2019t replaced with some equally risky compound, the damage done by these antibacterials could finally become a thing of the past.",

        "text": "There\u2019s a debate that anyone who has spent any amount of time thinking about being a writer has come across. (I\u2019m going to go out on a ledge an say anyone who has thought about being any sort of artist has come up against this debate.)\n\nShould we write because we must or should we write for money?\n\nThe must side is so earnest. Writers who insist that they write because they have no choice. It\u2019s write or perish. And having readers is incidental. Money actually diminishes their must-ness.\n\nThe write for money side can be cold. They never write for free. They only write to their market. They hustle out work with shocking speed. They have the bottom line in mind at all times and being paid what they\u2019re worth is the most important thing.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make me scream.\n\nLook. You don\u2019t have to choose.\n\nYou can be an earnest writer who feels honestly moved to be a storyteller \u2014 and still want to be paid for your work.\n\nAnd you can want to earn money and still fully believe that you must write or die.\n\nI\u2019ve been writing pretty much every day since the sixth grade. I\u2019m 47, so we\u2019re talking about a habit stretching back more than thirty-five years.\n\nI went to battle with my high school so that they\u2019d let me take a creative writing class my senior year instead of AP world literature. My undergraduate work was in creative writing and I have a MFA.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted to be when I grow up is a writer.\n\nWould I write, even if I wasn\u2019t being paid?\n\nYeah. I would.\n\nIn fact, I have. I sure wrote a lot before I was ever paid for it. And I paid a lot for the privilege of learning how to do it better.\n\nBut guess what? I like being paid for my work. And I\u2019m so sick of the insinuation that there\u2019s something wrong with learning how to treat writing like what it is: a business.\n\nIt isn\u2019t leveled at me very often \u2014or at least, not that I notice. I\u2019ll admit to being not super sensitive to the accusation when it\u2019s thrown my way. It doesn\u2019t matter to me any more than if someone screamed hey, you\u2019re really tall at me or omg, your hair is so brown.\n\nOkay. So I am. So it is. And yeah, I\u2019m a professional writer who gets paid for her work. Readers matter to me. I get excited about them. So, the accusation, when it does come, rolls off.\n\nBut I see so many newer, less experienced writers gutted by the idea that if they aspire to a career as a writer they\u2019re some how not real writers.\n\nSo, in case you need it . . .\n\nYou have permission to get excited about the business side of writing.\n\nYou have permission to celebrate earning a pay check for your writing. (Here\u2019s a hint for you \u2014 almost all of the time, the must-ers aren\u2019t getting a pay check. The must argument makes them feel better about themselves. And whatever, okay. But you don\u2019t have to let it bring you down.)\n\nYou have permission to build an email list and learn about running a small business and conduct yourself like a professional.\n\nWill I feel sorry for you if you professionalize writing to the point that there\u2019s no room left for art or generosity? I really will.\n\nWill you look like a tool if you take a public stance against ever writing something you\u2019re not paid for? Yep.\n\nBut those are your choices.\n\nAnd on the flip side . . .\n\nYou have permission to write for free. You even have permission to never once, in your whole life, give a thought to being paid for your work.\n\nYou have permission to write something just because it feels good, without any thought at all toward how you\u2019ll monetize it.\n\nYou have permission to treat your writing like art and never think about it as a business.\n\nWill I feel sorry for you if you\u2019re never able to let yourself turn your art into your career? I will, if you\u2019re miserable in your actual career and I think you could be a professional writer, sure.\n\nWill you look like a tool if you get up on your high horse about not caring about being paid for writing? Oh, yes.\n\nBut, those are your choices.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t have permission to do is tear someone else down.\n\nYou do you. Try to give other people the space and grace to do them.\n\nEven if what they do isn\u2019t the way you do things.",

        "text": "These similarities below are the skills and tools that both roles use. Mainly used by both are the programming languages and tools that help to deploy a Data Science model. Depending on the company, a Data Scientist could expect to work more on deployment, or the same could be said about a Data Engineer.\n\nMost importantly in Data Science, is the ability to communicate. You will most likely have to work with a Product Manager or stakeholder to go over weaknesses in the business before you even look at the data in your company and start your Data Science model building process.\n\nThis is also the case in higher education, where even choosing a college has become a matter of life and death. We have moved from a time when colleges were a community\u2019s lifeblood \u2014 providing jobs, culture, and diversity of thought and experience \u2014 to a time when many college campuses have become Covid hotspots, bringing rising infection rates and fear to the communities they once enriched.\n\nNow if you need to reference the name later, you will be doing so via a named variable vs. an index value. This works well for response data that you\u2019ll likely know the structure of. As long as the person\u2019s information is always in the same order, you can destructure and assign everything over and over again to avoid using index values.\n\nUsing the ** operator on the dict as you\u2019re passing a dict to the function allows you to unpack all of the arguments successfully (instead of accidentally passing the dict object itself). Although this method does add another variable and a separate data structure, it improves overall readability when there are a larger number of arguments. Moving the function call around or referencing multiple calls to the same function with the same (or slightly tweaked) arguments now becomes infinitely easier and requires less overall modification.\n\nIf you pass a class to dir, it will list all of the attributes for that object. This includes the names of its functions. By filtering for a prefix, suffix, or included keyword in the string name, we can group the functions of this class into different categories. This allows us to \u201cpick up\u201d new functions whose names include a keyword and either call them all or perform other logic with them later on in the code.\n\nAlthough certain formats of this indentation style might technically be allowed in PEP8, I personally do not enjoy looking at heavily indented function arguments. You are forced to move your eyes all the way over to the right, some IDEs don\u2019t play nice with this indentation, and using this style inhibits future extensibility.\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/P-v-O1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/P-v-O1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/P-v-O1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/P-v-O1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/P-v-O1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/R-v-A01.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/R-v-A02.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/R-v-A03.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/R-v-A04.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/yzf/R-v-A05.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Cska-v-Roma01.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Cska-v-Roma02.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Cska-v-Roma03.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Cska-v-Roma04.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Cska-v-Roma05.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Liege-v-Benfica01.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Liege-v-Benfica02.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Liege-v-Benfica03.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Liege-v-Benfica04.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Napoli-v-Real01.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Napoli-v-Real02.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Napoli-v-Real03.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Napoli-v-Real04.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Salonika-v-Granada01.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Salonika-v-Granada02.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Salonika-v-Granada03.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Salonika-v-Granada04.html\n\nhttp://wearabletechnologyshow.net/cnn/Salonika-v-Granada05.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/p-v-g01.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/p-v-g02.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/p-v-g03.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/p-v-g04.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/p-v-g05.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-b1.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-b2.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-b3.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-b4.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-b5.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-m1.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-m2.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-m3.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-m4.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-m5.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-r01.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-r02.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-r03.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-r04.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/s-v-r05.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/t-v-a01.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/t-v-a02.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/t-v-a03.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/t-v-a04.html\n\nhttps://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/joz/t-v-a05.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/n-v-r5.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/n-v-r4.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/n-v-r3.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/n-v-r2.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/n-v-r1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/l-v-r05.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/l-v-r04.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/l-v-r03.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/l-v-r02.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/l-v-r01.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/d-v-a4.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/d-v-a3.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/d-v-a2.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/d-v-a1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/c-v-l-er5.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/c-v-l-er4.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/c-v-l-er3.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/c-v-l-er2.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/c-v-l-er1.html\n\nhttps://www.d-tec.nl/apv/d-v-a5.html\n\nIf you\u2019re using an API that requires an API key, please keep that key a secret. If you\u2019re not planning on uploading your code or hosting your project publicly, you should be fine, but if you are going to upload it to GitHub or host it live then take these steps to keep your API key secret.\n\nWe have moved from a time when colleges were a community\u2019s lifeblood \u2014 providing jobs, culture, and diversity of thought and experience \u2014 to a time when many college campuses have become Covid hotspots, bringing rising infection rates and fear to the communities they once enriched.\n\nThere are lessons to be learned for organizations, leaders, and individuals. For Champlain College, all that we learned from the pandemic this fall helps to fuel our optimism about the future. The following lessons are ones we will take forward in defining what 2021 looks like on our campus:\n\nThen when you want to use this environment variable in your code, refer to it using process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY instead of a string containing your API key. Don\u2019t forget to also add your .env file to your .gitignore.As covered earlier, APIs are a great tool to understand and implement. This article has set out to provide an overview of what APIs are, examples of popular APIs, and a brief tutorial on how to make requests. I hope that this article has been helpful, thanks for reading!https://medium.com/dataseries/hiding-secret-info-in-python-using-environment-variables-a2bab182eea \u2014 This is a great tutorial blog post on using environment variables in Python.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has transformed us from a nation that shunned discussions of death to one that receives daily mortality reports. In the face of unimaginable loss \u2014 of friends, family, jobs, and freedom \u2014 many have adopted a \u201chospice mentality,\u201d a state of mind where our best days are behind us and the future is bleak.\n\nIn your project folder, create a file called .env (a file where we can store environment variables). In this file on the first line, you\u2019re going to want to type REACT_APP_API_KEY= and then paste your API key. No quotes, no ;\n\nUsing the ** operator on the dict as you\u2019re passing a dict to the function allows you to unpack all of the arguments successfully (instead of accidentally passing the dict object itself). Although this method does add another variable and a separate data structure, it improves overall readability when there are a larger number of arguments. Moving the function call around or referencing multiple calls to the same function with the same (or slightly tweaked) arguments now becomes infinitely easier and requires less overall modification.\n\nFor skills, these are used to query data, clean data, apply transformations, prepare data for Machine Learning algorithms, and visualize both exploratory data analysis and results of the Data Science model. Data Scientists often use platforms like Jupyter Notebook as well (or other similar ones) to perform research, including both code and comments, with a nice way to visualize and organize their work in progress.\n\nAs covered earlier, APIs are a great tool to understand and implement. This article has set out to provide an overview of what APIs are, examples of popular APIs, and a brief tutorial on how to make requests. I hope that this article has been helpful, thanks for reading!\n\nWhen I started my presidency at Champlain College in Burlington, VT on July 1, our students had been sent home and the pandemic ravaged the country. Leading a college through a pandemic during a time of economic upheaval, social unrest, racial injustice, a divisive political landscape, and a climate crisis, has been the greatest test of my professional career. Yet I believe the true test of a leader is finding ways to pivot in an uncertain world and meet challenges with innovation and creativity.\n\nEven as we approach a year of the pandemic with no end in sight, I feel optimistic about the future. And, I am not alone. A survey commissioned by Champlain College Online about career prospects, Covid-19, and the election found 66% of responders felt positive about the future. That positivity also translated into action, with two out of three respondents taking steps to improve their career prospects.\n\nWhat are some of the key skills and concepts that define the role of a Data Scientist? There is plenty to discuss, so I will include some of these that I have personally worked with or have seen across several job descriptions. A Data Scientist can be defined in different ways, with differing opinions, but to me, I believe a Data Scientist is a person who employs the use of data and Machine Learning algorithms, to solve business problems efficiently. Therefore, with this definition, I will speak to the respective skills that tie in.Before we start, let\u2019s acknowledge that these roles vary from company to company. That being said, there are still general themes to each specific role of Data Scientist and Data Engineer that differentiate them. Simply put, the skills and tools of each role can see plenty of overlap, but the concepts and goals differ greatly. I will be discussing in more detail the skills, concepts, similarities, and differences between the two positions. Please read below for a discussion on Data Science and Data Engineering; what makes them similar, and what makes them different.These concepts below are ones to keep in mind as Data Science is not just code and programming, but a role that helps to solve business problems. Efficiency and saving money go hand-in-hand, and they are especially prevalent for Data Scientists. These are useful for any role, but for Data Science, the goal is to automate a process from the benefit of a Machine Learning algorithm. In turn, this model will save money and time. You will need to know how the specific algorithms work so that you can also optimize for the best algorithm. Statistics is important to know, especially when you are A/B testing and setting up experiments for a product.\n\nIn this example, let\u2019s assume we have the class above containing a large number of functions. Some of these functions serve a special purpose and should be dynamically accessible. We want any special function that we add to this class to be immediately picked up by the rest of our code so that it begins working right away. One way to accomplish this is simply by using dir on the containing class.",

        "text": "Don\u2019t Be a Writer, Be an Entrepreneur Who Writes\n\nThe world isn\u2019t short of great writers, it\u2019s short of great entrepreneurs who write\n\nPhoto by Austin Distel on Unsplash\n\nAn entrepreneur who writes is different from a writer. Being an entrepreneur means your true passion lies in using your wits to make money. Writing is your weapon of choice. A writer\u2019s passion, by contrast, lies in the craft itself.\n\nA quick multiple choice question can reveal which one you are.\n\nIs making money from your writing more important than being a great writer?\n\na) Yes, definitely.\n\nb) No, being a great writer is more important.\n\nc) I\u2019d like to have both equally.\n\nGot your answer?\n\nHere\u2019s the twist. It doesn\u2019t matter what you choose. Writing and blogging is so competitive you have little choice but to adapt and evolve into an entrepreneur. If writing is more important, treat the entrepreneurial side of things as a necessary evil that helps facilitate your passion.\n\nPlan like an entrepreneur\n\nAn entrepreneur views writing as a means to an end. Not the end itself. Being an awesome writer helps, but it\u2019s not the most important aspect of a writing based business/side-hustle.\n\nAs with any startup, writing a blog post requires an investment in planning and research. A single blog post requires a business plan. Yup, you read that correctly.\n\nA reminiscent post about how your sibling used to blow their nose and wipe it on you (that\u2019s just a hypothetical example) doesn\u2019t need a business plan. I\u2019m talking specifically about money posts intended to carve out your own slice of the pie, make money, or contribute to the foundation of your writing empire.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of what a blog post business plan contains.\n\nBlog post business plan from How to make money blogging on SME Pals.\n\nLike any entrepreneur starting a business you need to know:\n\nHow much time and effort is required.\n\nWhat financial costs there are.\n\nWhat gaps or angles exist.\n\nWhat obstacles exist.\n\nWho the competition is and what they\u2019re doing right (and wrong).\n\nHow much traffic there is.\n\nWho your audience is.\n\nHow much money you can make (depending on the type of affiliate relationship, product or service you\u2019re offering).\n\nHow to make that money.\n\nHow long it will take to start making money.\n\n\u2026\n\nFor me, the most valuable part of putting together a business plan is the market research \u2014 more specifically, competitor analysis. Competitor analysis is wildly useful for bloggers. It illuminates the tactics successful competitors use to win market share and earn revenue. If you want to be the best, learn from the best.\n\nCompetitor analysis illuminates the tactics successful competitors use to win market share and earn revenue.\n\nMost of all, and I can\u2019t stress how important this is,\n\nA blog post business plan will tell you whether or not your idea is viable and worth pursuing.\n\nDon\u2019t waste time on content you have already shown to have insufficient earning potential. Find something else. Explore new topics. Move on.\n\nDownload a free blog post business plan template I put together here.\n\nWrite like an entrepreneur\n\nHere\u2019s where writers and entrepreneurs who are writers join hands. At this stage, the better you are at engaging and captivating an audience, the better you\u2019ll do.\n\nHere are some handy tips I\u2019ve found to work well for money-content.\n\nWin the title\n\nTitles are hard!\n\nYou have to juggle three things at once in a single, short sentence:\n\nUse target SEO keywords Accurately describe the content Spark intrigue\n\nTake time over the title. It is absolutely critical to the success of your post.\n\nA title is to a blog post what an elevator pitch is to a startup.\n\nWired wrote an article about what a difference clickable headlines make.\n\nThe difference between a good headline and a bad headline can be just massive. It\u2019s not (in the ballpark of) a rounding error. When we test headlines we see 20% difference, 50% difference, 500% difference. A really excellent headline can make something go viral.\n\nAdapt and fine-tune the title as you go. Hold off until it\u2019s ready to go out there and captivate people. The title is often the last thing I work on \u2014 once I fully understand the content and purpose of the article itself.\n\nDraw \u2019em in description\n\nMake the description a promise of something greatly valuable for the reader.\n\nA blog description must inspire readers with an exciting promise of value.\n\nAlong with the header, the description is about the only chance you have to convince visitors to click thru. Don\u2019t waste it on a dry, boring description.\n\nTo do this properly you need to understand who\u2019s going to be reading the article and what they need to know.\n\nThe description isn\u2019t about the content; it\u2019s about the reader.\n\nGripping section titles\n\nGripping. Is. Key.\n\nMake sub-titles and headers gripping. Never, ever let go of the reader\u2019s attention. Not for a second. Like the description, sub-headers should inspire and intrigue, pulling readers along. Gary Korisko gives us this great quote.\n\nThe four main ingredients of great sub-headers are curiosity, surprise, personality & emotion.\n\nPitch perfect\n\nThis is one aspect of writing I struggle with the most. Often, writing about topics in which I have a lot of experience causes me to lose the audience quickly. Avoid assuming too much or too little knowledge. Both are equally adept at turning readers off.\n\nThe better you understand your audience, the easier it is to pitch content in a way that keeps them captivated.\n\nCaptivate \u2018em\n\nAlways maintain your energy and enthusiasm while writing. Take regular breaks to keep your mind fresh. Write when inspiration strikes.\n\nFind a method that works for you and do everything in your power to avoid slipping into a mediocre, run-of-the-mill voice that allows readers to drift away (without a conversion).\n\nFormat for skimmers\n\nFormatting plays a big role. Spacing, structure, fonts & layout all make a big difference in how easily readers digest and retain information.\n\nAbove all else. Be concise & clear. According to Hubspot,\n\n73% of visitors skim rather than read the blog post thoroughly.\n\nFormatting is a way to break up content in a way that entices readers to keep going. Especially people who are starting out with a cursory scan of the article to see if it\u2019s worth their time.\n\nCite experienced influencers & experts\n\nDon\u2019t look at blogging as something you do alone.\n\nBlogging is a collaborative effort and diverse perspectives add value.\n\nGathering input from influencers in your niche is incredibly important for a bunch of reasons.\n\nExperts know stuff (you don\u2019t)\n\nRelationships you build with influencers are valuable\n\nInfluencers can increase your reach and buzz\n\nInfluencers help you build trust & authority with your audience\n\nOut of all these points, really the most salient and immediately valuable one is that including quotes and inputs from great influencers helps turn them into evangelists for your article \u2014 when it comes time to publish like an entrepreneur.\n\nInfluencers who have contributed to your article are more likely to mention or promote it.\n\nPublish like an entrepreneur\n\nPlanning and creating content, together, should only constitute around one-third of your total investment in a piece of content\u2014 both in terms of time and money. That\u2019s more or less how things tend to pan out for me. Maybe more, maybe less depending on your unique topic, network and reach.\n\nPlanning and creating content, together, should only constitute around one-third of your total investment in a piece of content.\n\nI tend to publish money-pieces to my own blog because I want it to generate income for some time to come. Publishing a piece like this on 3rd party platforms arguably provides greater initial reach and a higher chance of ranking in Google search. It also comes with some potentially serious downsides.\n\nMany big publisher will happily take your content and publish at an off-time where it quickly disappears from the front page without so much as a ripple. If that happens, it\u2019s all for nothing. At least if it\u2019s on your own site, you can continue to promote it and write guest articles citing any useful stats, facts and figures to keep a stream of traffic trickling along.\n\nWhatever you choose, it\u2019s time to start marketing. As I like to say,\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what business you are in; the business you are in is marketing.\n\nTo wit, the folks at GrowthBadger had this to say about marketing and promoting your blog.\n\n70% of bloggers who earn over $50,000 per year say they are active or very active promoters of their blogs, compared to only 14% of lower-income bloggers.\n\nMake the news\n\nPart of the business plan, back when you first started conceptualizing the article, would identify and integrate news media opportunities in some form or another. There should be at least one (preferably more) hook. Either:\n\nInclude newsworthy content (original research, current trends, novelty, conflict, etc) in the post Create news that cites your blog post\n\nInterest stories are a great way to go \u2014 especially if it cites your new article in some way or another.\n\nCreate a newsworthy story by talking about other people, organizations or businesses doing incredible things.\n\nInclude local content if local media coverage is important. Interview people. Do Research. Offer a prize. Offer a scholarship. Do whatever it takes to be able to pitch something unique and interesting to reporters and journalists covering your beat.\n\nJust. Be. Newsworthy.\n\nI wrote an article highlighting the best new business ideas coming out of U.S. universities. That\u2019s newsworthy because it a showcases up and coming entrepreneurial talent bubbling away at American colleges. Also, it has nothing to do with me.\n\nPitching a great story to the right media often results in a bit of coverage that can go a long way.\n\n10 best new business ideas from university entrepreneurs posted to USA Today.\n\nGetting into the news requires a slightly different set of writing skills. Namely, press releases. At some point you\u2019ll need to learn how to hook journalists using attention-grabbing headlines and give them everything they need to make their news article easy and compelling for their readers.\n\nYou can check out a press releases templates, including a few practical tips here.\n\nInfluence the influencers\n\nHaving worked hard to collaborate with a whole bunch of experts and influencers, it\u2019s now time to put those newfound contacts to good use (apart from the, hopefully, great quotes and info they contributed to your piece).\n\nPut together a personalized pitch for each person you mentioned or collaborated with. Here\u2019s a quick template that should do the trick for someone you only mentioned (but don\u2019t necessarily know personally):\n\nSubject: Congrats! You\u2019ve been mentioned in my latest article.\n\nHi [name],\n\nI really learned a lot from your piece about [title] and mentioned it (with a link) under [sub-topic] in my latest article [title][link].\n\nI\u2019d love it if you would consider contributing an additional insight for this article?\n\nIt can be as long or short as you like. I will of course cite and link your contribution. If you can also share a link to a head-shot that would be great.\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid\n\nThe purpose of this outreach is primarily to thank them for being awesome enough to include in your post. Next, you want to tell them you\u2019ve already given them great coverage (without asking for anything first). Finally there\u2019s an offer to contribute more \u2014 requiring them to at least take the time to look at your article.\n\nThis is significantly more effective than any of the hundreds of emails I get on an ongoing basis asking me for coverage in one of my posts. Instead of asking for something, reach out to share what you\u2019ve already done for them (not a promise to do something, if only they\u2026).\n\nInfluence any influencer with an easy 3-step process. Offer. Engage. Pitch.\n\nAlternatively, if they collaborated with you, the outreach email might look more like this:\n\nSubject: I\u2019ve added your awesome insights!\n\nHi [name],\n\nI added and linked your contribution. Thanks so much. I\u2019m super happy with it.\n\nCheck it out at [title][link].\n\nI\u2019ve also followed you on [social network] and [2nd/3rd/etc social network] to keep up to date with what you\u2019re working on. Feel free to drop me a line if I can help out or contribute in any way.\n\nIf you love the article please consider linking or mentioning it.\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid\n\nIn this instance you are thanking them for being awesome. Letting them know that you\u2019ve become a fan and are following them. Offering to work with them and collaborate on future projects. Requesting a link or a mention if they really like the article (their name is on it already so it\u2019s far more likely they will at least share it around).\n\nCast a wide net\n\nInitially, if the article is self-published, it\u2019s likely not going to drive much traffic \u2014 unless you have a huge audience and/or a good relationship with Google\u2019s first page rankings.\n\nSpend some time exploring related content. It could be drilling down into more depth, new research, finding opposing views, or whatever. Get new content up and about that links back to your article from other blogs and sites.\n\nDraw on your newfound experience and knowledge to write and pitch fantastic guest articles to related blogs, websites & media.\n\nDon\u2019t stop\n\nAn article is never really finished. There will always be new opportunities for marketing and promotions to explore. Opportunities to add and update the article with great new content. Opportunities to unearth new opportunities.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the entrepreneur in you to find clever new gaps to exploit, build new partnerships to generate more revenue, or simply decide to move on to the next exciting article. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to sit back and watch earnings build up passively over time.\n\nLike this\n\nPassive earnings from a single blog post.\n\nDecide to promote via social media. Or don\u2019t. Try paid advertising. Or don\u2019t. Learn new tricks from people who are dominating. Or blaze your own trail. The sky really is the limit when it comes to the business of content. That\u2019s what interests me the most.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll get lucky and an article will out-earn your expectations handsomely. It happens now and then. Dumb luck definitely plays a role. Make sure you\u2019re in the game long enough by being smart about everything you publish. In the long run, it\u2019s way more profitable to make your own luck.",

Voltage Imaging\n\nThe firing and the wiring at the same time\n\nCredit: Pixabay\n\nThe best thing about being a neuroscientist is that neuroscience never stands still. Barely a week passes without some new major result, a sparkling technological breakthrough, a provoking theoretical idea. And the sheer complexity of brains means the questions available are practically infinite. So even if your specific corners of brain research have briefly slowed their breathless pace, there is always more to learn. Always new questions to tackle. Indeed, there are whole regions of the mammalian brain whose mysteries have barely been probed, and which will no doubt turn out to be crucial for our understanding. My money\u2019s on the zona incerta, the globus pallidus, and the septum. Exciting times.\n\nThe worst thing about being a neuroscientist is that neuroscience never stands still. Barely a week passes without some new result, breakthrough, or theory that you don\u2019t have time to read; that ends up filed for later, destined never to be opened; or to be skimmed and not assimilated.

So even if you\u2019re lucky enough that your specific corners of brain research have briefly slowed their breathless pace, there is always more to learn. Always new questions to tackle. Indeed, there are whole regions of the mammalian brain whose mysteries have barely been probed, and which will no doubt turn out to be crucial for our understanding. Worrying times.\n\nParadoxically, this best and worst of all possible worlds in mind research is created by mindless churn. Of doing whatever can or could be done next. Not what should be done next. So, hubristically, I thought I\u2019d plant my feet against the torrent and take a stab at separating the should from the could. A series of occasional pieces that set out to answer the question: what should systems neuroscience do next?\n\nIn this first piece, we start with the very definition of systems neuroscience. It is at heart the study of the activity of multiple individual neurons, of the messages they are sending. Everything we see, do, or think in the moment is through neurons sending spikes to each other. So a clear priority for systems neuroscience is to make the best recordings of the output of the most neurons, and with as much metadata about those neurons \u2014 where they are, how many there are, what type they are \u2014 as possible.\n\nWe have two mainstream ways of recording the output of individual neurons: insert electrodes to record spikes, or image calcium fluxes in the neurons\u2019 bodies as a proxy for spikes. Both have unique strengths, both are constantly evolving in the white-heat of technology (and cash), but both have problems that are solved by the other. So our first \u201cshould\u201d: we should find a recording method that combines the strengths of both. The great news is that we already know the answer. The answer is voltage imaging.\n\nAnd if we get it solved, voltage imaging comes with a massive bonus prize, something neither electrodes nor calcium imaging can buy us: live connectomics.",

        "title": "Why Writing Online Is Different",
        "text": "I published my first article in November 2014. I had no idea what I was doing, but I had fun. Ironically, the only way to keep this fun around long-term was to consider writing the most serious job I\u2019ve ever had. So I committed.\n\nNow, over four years later, nothing is the same. Except that part. The fun\u2019s still here. I even have a slightly better idea of what I\u2019m doing. But writing online is different from anything I\u2019d ever imagined or associated with that word.\n\nHere are 3 lessons I rarely see others mention, but that helped me get to now.\n\n1. People aren\u2019t waiting to change their perspective. You have to do it for them.\n\nNo none walks around saying: \u201cI wish someone changed my mind about productivity.\u201d That\u2019s not how humans work. We\u2019re intensely focused on our day, ourselves, our next task at hand, zipping through everyday life with tunnel vision. Browsing the web and reading online are no different.\n\nIf anything, we hope to bump into ideas that confirm our worldview, not challenge it. This onus lies entirely on you, the writer. People don\u2019t just underestimate it but, often, abandon this challenge altogether, going the easier route of telling people what they know they\u2019ll want to hear.\n\nThis works for a while, especially when you\u2019re just beginning, but it gets old really quick. Readers don\u2019t know they\u2019re driven by these biases, but from feeding them, even subconsciously, they still get bored. And that\u2019s a feeling they know. So they move on.\n\nWhat they might not know they want \u2014 but need \u2014 is an idea that cracks their perspective. A tiny fracture, just big enough for them to raise their eyebrows. To blink twice. To scroll up again. Presenting this idea is what I try to do in most of my headlines. The article is just the fulfillment center.\n\nThe line between offending people and making them think is infinitely small. But learning to dance on it is one of the most important skills you\u2019ll ever learn.\n\n2. The only agenda that works is to have no agenda.\n\nThat sounds weird. Of course I have an agenda. Everyone does. I want dollars. Followers. Views. However, the single greatest way to maximize all of those in the long run is to not care when you\u2019ll get them and in what order.\n\nBecause that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll be free to overwhelm the platforms you write on with generosity, consistency, and genuine care. It\u2019s not about you. Great work never is. The sooner you can act that out, the earlier you\u2019ll take off.\n\nWhat does the host want? What do readers want? What does the platform want for its readers and what do readers expect for giving their invaluable time and attention to this place? Notice how absent you are from all these important questions. I know it\u2019s counterintuitive, but it\u2019s also liberating.\n\nNo one cares about what you want, but then you also don\u2019t have to care about your own mess-ups. You can just try again. Whatever you do, if you start from integrity and maintain it above all else, you\u2019ll never be in a rush to get yours.\n\nBecause you\u2019ll know it\u2019s coming to you. Maybe not tomorrow and definitely not today. But it\u2019s coming \u2014 and you\u2019ll know what to do with it once it does.\n\n3. Change before you need to or you\u2019ll adapt too late.\n\nIf you were to browse through my entire history of articles, you\u2019d think it\u2019s a collection of writing from at least five different people. Everything changes, all the time. Style. Voice. Content. Vocabulary. Structure. Formatting.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s me reaching the next level. Sometimes, it\u2019s me adopting a trend early. Most of the time, however, it\u2019s me experimenting on purpose. Changing for the sake of change. To set trends, rather than wait for them.\n\nAt first sight, this is a stupid strategy. Why give up what\u2019s working? Why mess with a winning team? It means I\u2019m alienating my fans. Or forcing them to grow with me. I\u2019ll lose the people who just got here and I might not win over those who are about to. But it also means I\u2019m staying true to myself.\n\nWho wants to be one-dimensional? Who actually is? No one. Consistency of character is a myth. Just like content that confirms our views, it\u2019s attractive on the surface, but boring and inauthentic underneath.\n\nIf you embrace your contradictions and allow them to flow freely, you still won\u2019t get every shift in context right each time, but you\u2019ll learn to keep an open mind. It\u2019ll be easier to write more game changers (see #1) and reduce friction when you have to adapt (see #2). Most of all, it\u2019ll keep writing fun.\n\nAnd isn\u2019t that what we truly want?",

        "title": "Your Brand is What People Expect From You",
        "text": "Your Brand is What People Expect From You\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do about it\n\nPhoto by Nadine Shaabana via Unsplash\n\nWhen people first meet you, they don\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nSo they start judging you by your name, your profile picture, and the title of your blog post.\n\nIf you\u2019re a writer, people will probably meet your words before they meet you.\n\nWhat are your words saying to them?\n\nI\u2019m a nice person.\n\nI know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nI have a B.S. in History.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t just say those things and expect us to believe them or be impressed. It\u2019s better for you to prove it and let us draw these conclusions ourselves.\n\nWhen we read your words, we\u2019re after something. Maybe we\u2019re bored and we want you to give us a distraction. Maybe we want an edge and we need your advice to raise our status. Or maybe we are interested in what you\u2019re talking about and you happen to share our worldview.\n\nYou won\u2019t automatically have our trust because we agree with you. But it\u2019s a nice start, and perhaps the best route to get trust quickly.\n\nThe best way to gain trust is to keep showing up.\n\nI\u2019ve learned this lesson the hard way. There have been times in my life when my freelance work sucked all my time away. When that happens, I feel like I can\u2019t be as generous with my words.\n\nWhen you disappear, people forget.\n\nWho was that guy who was so good? Yeah. What happened to him?\n\nHey, have you heard about this new writer? He\u2019s hot. He knows stuff I never dreamed anyone could know. It\u2019s like he can read my mind.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how fast that can happen.\n\nShow up. Every day if you can. At least once a week. Find a regular rhythm and stick with it. And if you really want to dig deep, write twice as much as you think you can.\n\nBut what if it isn\u2019t perfect?\n\nIt never will be, so quit worrying.\n\nYour best today won\u2019t be your best next week, next month, or next year. It\u2019s your responsibility to push yourself. Stretch a little every time you write. Dig a little deeper than you did last time. Write something that scares you a bit more. Take a stand, and don\u2019t back down.\n\nIn a world with millions of voice vying for attention, it\u2019s the bold and committed that stand out.\n\nBe you, always.\n\nYou have some control over what we expect.\n\nIt\u2019s your choice to deliver the same thing again and again. Or maybe you ruffle our feathers a bit each week. You\u2019ve got more room to play around in the beginning. But as your audience grows and gets more familiar with you, you need to be consistent.\n\nWhat will your message be?\n\nHow will you deliver it?\n\nWill your personality be friendly or businesslike? Will you challenge our assumptions? Will you draw us a better map? Will you take something confusing and break it down so we can understand it?\n\nBeing you means you do online what you\u2019d do in real life. Spot the trends if you like, but approach them with your own style. When you\u2019re fake, everyone will know.\n\nDon\u2019t chase dollars. Chase change. How will you leave your reader better than you found her?\n\nIn time, your audience defines your brand.\n\nYou set the first impression.\n\nYour audience sets the expectation.\n\nWait a minute, you say. You just said I set the expectation for people.\n\nYou do, at first.\n\nThen once it\u2019s set, people expect you to live up to it. Mess that up, and years of trust can be lost in a moment.\n\nSo tread carefully.\n\nIf you want to change your message because that\u2019s your conviction, go for it. Don\u2019t do it because the trends say you should. If you get in the habit of chasing the latest thing for attention, you might as well chase the wind.\n\nHere\u2019s the part of the market you should pay attention to.\n\nWhat does your audience want from you? If your message meets a need a lot of people have, that\u2019s probably not going to change overnight.\n\nTake writing for example.\n\nFor generations, the way to make it as an author was through books. If you published one or more, you were somebody. But you had to compete for the opportunity. You\u2019d probably get rejected most of the time. Because publishers need to make money, they bet on what they thought would sell.\n\nToday, anyone can write and publish a book. So, the problem the previous generation of writers faced is flipped. It\u2019s a lot harder to get noticed in the market when your book is one of millions of choices.\n\nSo, writers blog and make money instead. Books are now email magnets and manifestos. If you have a large following, you can command a higher price for your work. Otherwise, price low and be glad to get your message out so you can charge more later.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the expectation you\u2019ve set for your market, work to raise it.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing stopping you.\n\nIt will take work. You\u2019ll lose some people along the way. But you\u2019ll gain more who are devoted to the same thing you are. It doesn\u2019t take a huge audience to make it. It just takes an audience that is pleased enough to tell other people about you.\n\nBe authentic. Serve others first. Be generous. The more people you can, the better your future will be.\n\nNow go build a brand that matters.\n\nThis story is published in The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +406,714 people.\n\nSubscribe to receive our top stories here.",

        "title": "The Only Book About Writing You\u2019ll Ever Need",
        "text": "Writing\n\nThe Only Book About Writing You\u2019ll Ever Need\n\nI\u2019ve read it 10 times\n\nSix years ago, I sort of forgot how to write. I\u2019d been publishing on the internet for a little over a year \u2014 that first, embarrassing, thrilling, bringing-a-laptop-to-parties year (I\u2019m fun at parties) \u2014 and I\u2019d run out of things to say. What used to be casual, fast, easy breezy bloggy beautiful, had become\u2026 slightly boring. Slow. I\u2019d have an idea, stare at my laptop for an hour, Command-Tab over to Gmail, and then walk four blocks to buy an overpriced panini.\n\nSo, I did what I always do: I walked into a bookstore feeling vaguely depressed, and left with something to read.\n\nI know you just want the name of the book, so here you go: Several Short Sentences About Writing by Verlyn Klinkenborg. It\u2019s sort of a weird book, to be honest. It contains no paragraphs, just sentences stacked on top of each other in austere columns. (The whole thing sort of reads like a poem.) And yes, it\u2019s about the mechanics of putting words together, but it\u2019s also about other things: thinking, noticing, mapping the mess inside your head. Also, trusting yourself \u2014 something I have a difficult time doing.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of writing advice out there: books, articles, quotes from dead people. Most of it isn\u2019t actually about writing. It\u2019s about scheduling (wake up at six!), preparing to write (take good notes!), having ambition (write every day\u2026 at six\u2026), or envisioning what it will feel like to finally be done writing. Most people don\u2019t talk about the messy, often boring, sometimes excruciating and other times exhilarating process of staring at a computer and eating stale mixed nuts as you form thoughts into words.\n\nIn this book, you\u2019ll find no tips for outlining, brainstorming, scheduling, or pitching. Nothing on a thesis statement, a topic sentence, an introduction, or conclusion (spoiler: good ideas need no introduction, or conclusion!) Nothing on rituals or waiting for fictional characters to whisper in your ear. No fantasies about having a cabin in the woods with a big dog and a chunky sweater and a blank Moleskine. In fact, there\u2019s nothing in here about ~inspiration~ at all, nothing about waiting for the ideas to \u201cjust flow.\u201d (They never just flow. Sorry.)\n\nMy whole life is just going to be me rereading this book. It\u2019s sort of like I got really religious somewhere in my twenties, and this book is my Blogging Bible.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll find instead are practical, even curmudgeonly, tips about grammar, rhythm, and making individual sentences. Short ones, mostly. For example:\n\nKeep sentences small. They\u2019re easier to work with that way.\n\nIf something doesn\u2019t feel right, there\u2019s a problem with one or more of your sentences. Listen to that feeling. Try to pinpoint exactly which word or phrase is triggering it. Naming exactly what\u2019s wrong, in grammatical terminology or otherwise, will come later.\n\nUnderstanding a word\u2019s etymology will teach you how to use it. Words contain imprints of their histories.\n\nThe subject of a sentence should appear as close to the beginning of a sentence as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to \u201cgrab\u201d anyone with the first line of your story. Just write a simple sentence that says what you want it to say. It\u2019s harder than it sounds! And also very effective, if done well.\n\n\u201cA writer\u2019s real work is the endless winnowing of sentences, the relentless exploration of possibilities, the effort, over and over again, to see in what you started out to say the possibility of saying something you didn\u2019t know you could.\u201d\n\nNoun phrases (\u201cthe realization that\u2026\u201d) almost always sound clunky and dead. Try rewriting them as verb phrases (\u201crealizing that\u2026\u201d).\n\nPrepositions are difficult to get right, even for native English speakers.\n\nA reader\u2019s experience has nothing to do with a writer\u2019s. A sentence that reads \u201cnaturally\u201d or \u201cconversationally\u201d to a reader may have been painstakingly assembled by a stressed-out writer who wishes they could sound more natural or conversational.\n\nToward the end of this book, the author diagnoses exactly what\u2019s wrong with about 50 isolated sentences written by his students. It\u2019s sort of ruthless, but fascinating. Most of these sentences sound almost okay, though you can feel something slightly amiss. Hearing Klinkenborg (what a name) pinpoint the specific problems in each one \u2014 from an awkward metaphor to a misplaced pronoun \u2014 is therapeutic. It\u2019s sort of like Dr. Pimple Popper, but for dangling modifiers instead of giant cysts. I recommend reading the book just for this section.\n\nHere\u2019s a theory: Some people (i.e. me) procrastinate and never end up publishing anything because we\u2019re fixated on the bigger Thing \u2014 the Novel, the Post, the Feature, the Investigative Whatever. We\u2019re distracted by our intentions and our aspirations. But unless you\u2019ve somehow acquired a ghostwriter, none of those bigger Things are possible until you make sentences. It\u2019s tedious, but crucial. A wall is made of bricks. A story is made of sentences.\n\nI still forget how to write sometimes, but whenever I do I know where to turn. This book calms me down. It reminds me that writing is slow and difficult because it\u2019s a technology humans invented to communicate with each other thousands of years ago \u2014 not something we do \u201cnaturally.\u201d We have to be taught to write. And we have to practice. (There\u2019s an interesting part in the middle where Klinkenborg debunks our mistaken assumption that writing is \u201cnatural.\u201d We think it should flow, easily and conversationally, thanks to a false analogy with talking. But talking and writing are very different, as anyone who\u2019s tried to read a podcast transcript will tell you.)\n\nMost of all, this book encourages me to listen to what I actually think before trying to shape those thoughts into words. It\u2019s also taught me a lot about rhythm, beginnings, endings, nerdy things like participles, and clarity. These lessons don\u2019t just apply to writing. They also apply to thinking and living.\n\nI just finished reading it for, I think, the 10th time. (I know.) And right after I finished, I started back at page one. My whole life is just going to be me rereading this book. It\u2019s sort of like I got really religious somewhere in my twenties, and this book is my Blogging Bible. There I am, on a Saturday in the middle of a pandemic, sitting in my apartment practicing my new religion: figuring out what I\u2019m trying to say.",

There are .py (Python) files that will contain code for the layout and data manipulation. I used, and highly recommend, Visual Studio Code for working with these as there are a number of handy extensions available for formatting that is particularly helpful to build the HTML DOM structure which we will accomplish with this article.\n\nINSTALLATIONS\n\nFollow along the instruction in this Medium article to set up and run the Dash app server from Jupyter notebook. The notebook in Github also lists the packages used as well as their versions to help you get going.\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nThe Title bar declares the dashboard to be a Rental Analysis Dashboard. It will contain an icon to brand our dashboard. Beneath the title, on the left hand side, we create a navbar containing filters. For now these are generic dropdown lists containing three choices, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly. We will be using various types of filters as the project matures. The filter area is being defined in this scaffolding.\n\nTo the right of the filter pane is the chart area. I have split this up into four rows. The first row will be reserved for KPIs/gauges or cards with summary information to provide \u201cat a glance\u201d key aggregations.\n\nWe will follow that up with maps, line and bar chats to analyze the data from various angles. This will be the graphing area.\n\nAnd finally at the bottom is the narrow band of page navigation links.\n\nFolder structure and files\n\nWe will use Bootstrap to have a responsive dashboard page. To style the various HTML components and to use Bootstrap\u2019s CSS, we create a folder called assets in the root of the app directory. We will also create a folder called data down the line that will contain all the data we gather in CSVs from the Inside AirBnB website. For Dash to recognize this folder structure, note that creation of the app includes __name__ in the constructor.\n\nImportant: Why you need to include __name__ in your Dash constructor.\n\nThere are other elements that we will store in the assets folder such as the icon and logo images. Once this folder structure is followed, retrieving the assets is performed with a call which depends on the image file being present in the assets folder.",

        "text": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg beamed into a congressional hearing via video chat today to face 4+ hours of questions about whether they abuse their dominant positions in the market. Spoiler: they said everything\u2019s cool.\n\nBy Chloe Albanesius & Michael Kan\n\nThe CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.\n\nSpoiler: They all said they don\u2019t.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn\u2019t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.\n\nMembers on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook\u2019s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple\u2019s fabled walled-garden approach persists.\n\nSome Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon\u2019s JEDI project; and why a certain member\u2019s campaign emails keep ending up in his father\u2019s spam folder.\n\nThe four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.\n\n\u201cIn your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,\u201d Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. \u201cWhy should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?\u201d\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. \u201cI think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would\u2019ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\u201d he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.\n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, Instagram\u2019s success is largely due to Facebook\u2019s investment. \u201cI think this has been an American success story,\u201d he added.\n\nNadler disagreed. \u201cRather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAre You Threatening Me?\n\nNadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg\u2019s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.\n\n\u201cIn a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook \u2018was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,\u2019\u201d Rep. Jayapal noted. \u201cInstagram\u2019s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into \u2018destroy mode\u2019 if he didn\u2019t sell Instagram to you.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. \u201cI think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,\u201d he said.\n\nPreventing Imminent Risk of Life\n\nTwitter was not present at today\u2019s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president\u2019s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.\n\nThe video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn\u2019t one, Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cIn general\u2026we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg continued. But if \u201csomeone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug \u2026 we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.\u201d\n\nLater in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.\n\n\u201cWe believe in freedom of expression and there\u2019s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,\u201d Pichai said.",

        "text": "How to Be Productive and Creative in Times of Panic\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to mute the word \u2018coronavirus\u2019 on social media for 24 hours\n\nCredit: Westend61/Getty Images\n\nHours after the 9/11 attacks, I finally made it back to my apartment in uptown New York City. Like everyone else lucky enough to return home that day, I existed in a daze, not comprehending what had just happened and no longer sure how to function. I had no idea how to manage my anxiety in the weeks that followed, so I surrendered to the 24-hour news cycle and drank myself to sleep, hoping this would help me reclaim the world I had lost.\n\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic is a very different world event, the hysteria feels oddly familiar to what we experienced in 2001. Back then, public spaces seemed like death traps; today they feel like contagion zones. We don\u2019t know whether to trust the news. And there\u2019s no end in sight.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to deal with panic back in 2001, but I\u2019ve learned some more productive approaches since then. Here are some tips for staying calm, productive, and even creative during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAvoid the panic amplifiers\n\nMuch has been written about how social media intensifies our anxiety, and we never see this more clearly than during a crisis. Yesterday, I made the mistake of visiting my town\u2019s Facebook page, and the first post I read was one that questioned whether school officials were doing enough to keep classrooms disinfected. A heated discussion followed, with people telling each other they were overreacting, or underreacting. I got fully sucked into the drama, and before I knew it, an hour had passed.\n\nTo protect your mental health, limit your social media intake to a specified amount of time and make use of blocking features. Twitter allows you to mute specific words \u2014 you might want to do this with \u201ccoronavirus\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d for 24 hours once a week, just to give yourself a break. Of course, it\u2019s still important to stay informed, so follow official health organizations such as the WHO, CDC, and your local offices of emergency management, along with one national and one local news source. Check these sites twice a day max. While the news is constantly changing, obsessing over minute-by-minute updates won\u2019t do you any good.\n\nPrepare within reason\n\nFor peace of mind, stock up on two weeks of necessities \u2014 not 12 years worth of toilet paper. Cans of beans, soups, and boxes of pasta, oats, rice, and frozen vegetables store well. It will comfort you, just a little, to know you\u2019ve prepared your home for a potential quarantine situation, allowing you to focus on more productive tasks.\n\nConnect with others\n\nIn the days after 9/11, I spent a lot of time with my siblings and close friends. We were lucky in that we could hang out at bars and hug it out. Today, with social distancing, meeting up with others is not advisable, and even though I\u2019m surrounded by my immediate family at home, I\u2019m already feeling a little isolated.\n\nSo far, two things have been helping: connecting with family and friends through video chat and spending time online with fellow creatives. I\u2019m part of two writers\u2019 groups on Slack where we read each other\u2019s stories and share feedback. I\u2019ve found that on stressful days, the act of pouring myself into someone else\u2019s work provides me with a sense of normalcy and purpose.\n\nBinge on healthy distractions\n\nIn stressful times, it\u2019s easy to turn to bad habits. To make sure you don\u2019t, fill your environment with healthy distractions \u2014 good books, interesting podcasts, or maybe your yoga mat. These days, I keep The Selected Poems of Donald Hall with me at all times. The poems are quick to read and help me to refocus. Find something that stimulates your creative mind and stifles your urge to check your notifications yet again.\n\nPut sacred time on your calendar\n\nEach day, give yourself 30 minutes of solitude. (If you\u2019re suddenly working from home, you\u2019ve regained your commute time, so take advantage of it.) Turn off your phone. Take a walk. Meditate. Whatever you do, free yourself from any production goals. You can jot down interesting thoughts if they come to mind \u2014 they often do \u2014 but don\u2019t make this a work session. Total disconnection allows you to check in with yourself and primes your brain for creativity.\n\nMake something\n\nIf you\u2019re a creative person, you might feel like your work is trivial right now. But it\u2019s in times of uncertainty and fear that we depend on art to remind us that beauty and originality still exist. Creating something \u2014 whether it\u2019s a painting or a pie or a podcast \u2014 can help you and others find order and make sense of a confusing world. It doesn\u2019t matter whether what you make is good or not. The act of creation brings joy, a sense of pride, and helps you forget about the ills of the world, at least for a little while. In times of calm or panic, it may just be the most productive thing you can do.",

Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.\u201d \u2014 Steven Pressfield\n\nI used to be a master procrastinator in College. If my professor gave me a task to complete, I\u2019d always find an excuse. I\u2019d say it was too difficult, time-consuming, or anything else. And just like magic, someone more competent would do it for me.\n\nI enjoyed sitting on the couch. I hated going outdoors. So I guess it\u2019s no surprise that most people considered me to be extremely lazy. The only marathon I\u2019d ever complete was a twelve-hour binge of my favorite shows on Netflix.\n\nBut then the cash in my bank account began to disappear. The truth is that I wasn\u2019t making anywhere near enough money to support my lifestyle, so I needed to improve my work ethic.\n\nThe above quote from Stephen Pressfield changed my life forever. It made me realize that excuses are pointless. Why? Because nothing amazing will happen unless you sit down and do the work.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a fancy keyboard, perfect lighting, or anything else a productivity guru might say. Instead, just open your laptop, connect to the internet, and write. That\u2019s it.\n\nEach morning, I get up at approximately 7am, go to my desk, and write a new article for several hours. Following this routine has helped me to remain consistent, create a daily writing habit, and generate a full-time income doing something I love.\n\nIf you want to improve your creative process, consider doing the same. Find somewhere quiet to work, and do your best to write something. Because when you show up every day to write, the power of compound interest will create incredible results over time.",

        "text": "AI creating Human-Looking Images and Tracking Artificial Intelligence Programs in 2020\n\nMachine Learning Transforming Veterans Benefits\n\nThe Dutch artist, Bas Uterwijk is using artificial intelligence to create human portraits from paintings by combining with deep learning to change statutes to human faces.\n\nThe same applies to paintings where the AI software includes photo attributes such as light and variations to make the picture clear. The Artbreeder AI program recreates new images from scratch by using data points, which copy the photos.\n\nThe global competitiveness of the United States in artificial intelligence is declining because of poor management at the Department of Defense. Tracking artificial intelligence programs and encouraging data sharing are needed to make the US a global leader in AI.\n\nThe Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is creating a standardized AI definition and developing governance policies around artificial intelligence.\n\nVeterans face challenges claiming their benefits and a new machine learning application, Content Classification Predictive Service (CCPS), is spearheading efficient services and accuracy in handling veteran claims. Veterans wait for long as staff members check claims manually but CCPS can review information within a short time.\n\nThese and more insights on our Weekly AI Update\n\nAI creating Human-Looking Images\n\nArtificial intelligence is helping to create human-like portraits from statues and paintings of famous faces.\n\nBas Uterwijk a Dutch native artist used AI to create the photo-style portraits. He focused on well-known figures including Vincent Van Gogh and Napoleon Bonaparte. The #deeplearning technology enabled him to take a photo of a statue or a painting and turn it into a more human-like face. The software uses data points to pick up on facial features and photographic qualities.\n\nThe AI is called Artbreeder and can also create human-looking images from scratch. So far, they\u2019ve worked on 50 to 60 of the AI-generated pictures\u00b9. The artist is working on a model that could show Anne Frank at an age she never reached.\n\nTracking Artificial Intelligence Programs\n\nPoor management of artificial intelligence projects in the Department of Defense could erode the United States\u2019 competitive advantage in the emerging technology, the Defense Department\u2019s watchdog warned in a July 1 report.\n\nThe DoD inspector general suggested the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, established to facilitate the adoption of artificial intelligence tools across the department, take several steps to improve project management, including determining a standard definition of artificial intelligence, improving data sharing and developing a process to accurately track artificial intelligence programs. The JAIC missed a March 2020 deadline to release a governance framework. It still plans to do so, according to the report, but that date is redacted in the report.\n\nThe inspector general started the audit to determine the gaps and weaknesses in the department\u2019s enterprise-wide AI governance\u00b2, the responsibility of the JAIC. After starting its audit, the DoD IG determined the organization had not yet developed a department-wide AI governance framework.\n\nMachine Learning Transforming Veterans Benefits\n\nVeterans deserve fast access to their disability benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs is using a new #machinelearning tool\u00b3 to deliver these benefits to Veterans more quickly.\n\nThe tool\u2019s name is not easy to remember \u2014 Content Classification Predictive Service (CCPS) Application Programming Interface (API) \u2014 but the results are certainly hard to ignore. VA\u2019s Office of Information and Technology (OIT), working collaboratively in partnership with Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), developed and implemented CCPS to reduce the average time to establish Veteran disability compensation claims by three and a half days.\n\nCredit: Clarianchalets\n\nCCPS is also helping VA improve service to Veterans by increasing the speed and accuracy of disability claims reviews. The tool automatically performs repetitive tasks that formerly required staff review and input.\n\nDuring its first week of use, CCPS helped VA establish 3,994 out of 8,368 claims (48 percent) automatically without the need for manual intervention. Previously, VBA only processed about two percent of disability compensation claims automatically.\n\nVisual Causal Discovery Network\n\nResearchers at MIT, University of Washington, and the University of Toronto describe an AI system that learns the physical interactions\u2074 affecting materials like fabric by watching videos. They claim the system can extrapolate to interactions it has not seen before, like those involving multiple shirts and pants, enabling it to make long-term predictions.\n\nCausal understanding is the basis of counterfactual reasoning, or the imagining of possible alternatives to events that have already happened. For example, in an image containing a pair of balls connected to each other by a spring, counterfactual reasoning would entail predicting the ways the spring affects the balls\u2019 interactions.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 system \u2014 a Visual Causal Discovery Network (V-CDN) \u2014 guesses at interactions with three modules: one for visual perception, one for structure inference, and one for dynamics prediction. The perception model is trained to extract certain keypoints (areas of interest) from videos, from which the interference module identifies the variables that govern interactions between pairs of keypoints.\n\nEncouraging Growth in AI Research\n\nThe National Research Cloud, which has bipartisan support in Congress, gained approval of several universities, including Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Ohio State, and participation of Big Tech companies Amazon, Google and IBM.\n\nThe project would give academics access to a tech companies\u2019 #clouddata centers and public data sets, encouraging growth in AI research\u2075. Although the Trump administration has cut funding to other kinds of research, it has proposed doubling its spending on AI by 2022.\n\nThe research cloud, though a conceptual blueprint at this stage, is a sign of the largely effective campaign by universities and tech companies to persuade the American government to increase government backing for research into #artificialintelligence largely due to its recognition that AI technology is essential to national security and economic competitiveness.\n\nArtificial Intelligence assisted Robot Delivery\n\nRefraction AI\u2019s last-mile delivery robot\u2076, the REV-1, has seen an increase in lunch delivery requests since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Unsurprisingly, this contactless delivery option is now seeing a demand surge amid the coronavirus pandemic: Refraction AI has received three to four times more orders with the REV-1 since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe company, which first launched in July 2019, built the robot specifically for last-mile deliveries between stores and customers in urban communities like Ann Arbor, Mich., where the pilot program is now taking place.\n\nCustomers in the Ann Arbor community who live within the 2.5-mile delivery radius can sign up for REV-1\u2019s pilot lunch delivery program that\u2019s partnered with four three Asian and one Mexican restaurants, according to Refraction AI . There are also currently more potential partners still on a waitlist.\n\nAI-enabled Robotics for Waste Recycling\n\nWhen China restricted the importation of recyclable waste products in 2018, many western companies turned to robotic technologies to strengthen their processing capabilities. To recycle in a cost-effective, comprehensive and safe way, goods must be broken down into their constituent commodities to be sold on, in a process that has been likened to \u201cunscrambling an egg\u201d.\n\nRoboticists think that computer vision, neural networks and modular robotics can enable a more intelligent, flexible approach to recycling. AI-enabled #robotics\u2077 can identify items based on visual cues such as logos, colour, shape and texture, sorting them and taking them apart.\n\nIt can spot a Nestl\u00e9 logo depicting a cow and surmise that it is a dairy product. Such systems excel at identifying small items, such as the coffee pods used in Nespresso machines, which, while technically recyclable, are not always recycled.\n\nThe Montreal AI Ethics Institute\n\nThe Montreal AI Ethics Institute, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to defining humanity\u2019s place in an algorithm-driven world, today published its inaugural State of AI Ethics report\u2078. The 128-page multidisciplinary paper, which covers a set of areas spanning agency and responsibility, security and risk, and jobs and labor, aims to bring attention to key developments in the field of AI this past quarter.\n\nCredit: Zephyrnet\n\nThe State of AI Ethics first addresses the problem of bias in ranking and recommendation algorithms, like those used by Amazon to match customers with products they\u2019re likely to purchase. The authors note that while there are efforts to apply the notion of diversity to these systems, they usually consider the problem from an algorithmic perspective and strip it of cultural and contextual social meanings.\n\nThe authors advocate a solution in the form of a framework that does away with rigid, ascribed categories and instead looks at subjective ones derived from a pool of \u201cdiverse\u201d individuals: determinantal point process (DPP). Put simply, it\u2019s a probabilistic model of repulsion that clusters together data a person feels represents them in embedding spaces \u2014 the spaces containing representations of words, images, and other inputs from which AI models learn to make predictions.\n\nAn Ethical Eye on AI\n\nResearchers from the University of Warwick, Imperial College London, EPFL (Lausanne) and Sciteb Ltd have found a mathematical means of helping regulators and business manage and police Artificial Intelligence systems\u2019 biases towards making unethical, and potentially very costly and damaging commercial choices \u2014 an ethical eye on AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence is increasingly deployed in commercial situations such as using AI to set prices of insurance products\u2079 to be sold to a particular customer. There are legitimate reasons for setting different prices for different people, but it may also be profitable to \u2018game\u2019 their psychology or willingness to shop around.\n\nThe AI has a vast number of potential strategies to choose from, but some are unethical and will incur not just moral cost but a significant potential economic penalty as stakeholders will apply some penalty if they find that such a strategy has been used \u2014 regulators may levy significant fines of billions of Dollars, Pounds or Euros and customers may boycott you \u2014 or both.\n\nSo in an environment in which decisions are increasingly made without human intervention, there is therefore a very strong incentive to know under what circumstances AI systems might adopt an unethical strategy and reduce that risk or eliminate entirely if possible.\n\nSpearheading Data Science Initiatives\n\nPrinceton University researchers will push the limits of data science by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning across the research spectrum in an interdisciplinary pilot project made possible through a major gift from Schmidt Futures.\n\nThe Schmidt DataX Fund will help advance the breadth and depth of data science impact on campus, accelerating discovery in three large, interdisciplinary research efforts and creating a suite of opportunities to educate, train, convene and support a broad data science community\u00b9\u2070 at the University.\n\nThe Schmidt DataX Fund will be used to enhance the extent to which data science permeates discovery across campus and infuses machine learning and artificial intelligence into a range of disciplines. Many researchers and educators are eager to bring data science to their fields but lack the expertise, experience and tools.\n\nThe funds will support a range of campus-wide data science initiatives led by the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning, including: development of graduate-level courses in data science and machine learning; creation of mini-courses and workshops to train researchers in the latest software tools, cloud platforms and public data sets.\n\nNeutralizing COVID-19 with Robotics\n\nMIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is developing complex spaces easier to sanitize. Working closely with the Ava Robotics and the Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB), CSAIL team created a UVC structure that disinfects surfaces and neutralizes coronavirus particles lingering in the air. Fitted atop an Ava Robotics base, the robot could be trained to navigate spaces #autonomously in the future.\n\nThe ultraviolet light works best on directly visible surfaces, but even reflected light in nooks and crannies is effective. During tests at GBFB\u2019s warehouse, the prototype robot was teleoperated to get the lay of the land, but it\u2019s equipped to navigate the area without supervision someday. The robot slowly moves through the 4,000 square foot warehouse, neutralizing 90 percent of coronaviruses\u00b9\u00b9 on surfaces within half an hour.\n\nDeloitte AI Institute for Research and Applied Innovation\n\nDeloitte has opened the Deloitte AI Institute for research and applied innovation. The institute will publish cutting edge research, covering focus areas such as global advancements, the future of work, AI ethics, and case studies. The premier publications will include the bi-annual State of AI in the Enterprise study, as well as the Trustworthy AI framework for ethics\u00b9\u00b2.\n\nThe institute\u2019s network will also bring together top industry thought leaders and academics, startups, R&D groups, entrepreneurs, investors, and innovators. To this group, Deloitte will add its applied AI knowledge and understanding of industry pain points in order to help clients transform quickly with AI.\n\nThe network\u2019s thought leaders will also include prominent ethicists, who will work with Deloitte and top stakeholders from all parts of society to co-design effective policies for AI ethics.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n\u00b9AI-Generated Pictures, \u00b2AI Governance, \u00b3Machine-Learning Tool, \u2074Physical Interactions, \u2075Encouraging Growth in AI Research, \u2076Delivery Robot, \u2077AI-enabled Robotics, \u2078State of AI Ethics Report, \u2079Insurance Products, \u00b9\u2070Data Science Community, \u00b9\u00b9Coronaviruses, \u00b9\u00b2Trustworthy AI Framework for Ethics\n\nMore from David Yakobovitch:\n\nListen to the HumAIn Podcast | Subscribe to my newsletter",

        "title": "Evolution doesn\u2019t give a damn what you think a brain region is called",
        "text": "To evolution, the brain is just a gigantic bag of cells, wired together. The purpose of that gigantic bag of cells is to contribute to the survival of the organism in which it resides, to surviving long enough to reproduce. Those that reproduce, win; those that don\u2019t, don\u2019t.\n\nIf a random mutation causes or changes the wiring of some neurons to another group of neurons, and that mutation improves the chances of having offspring, it will likely spread through the population. If that random mutation adds connections from prefrontal cortex to visual cortex; from cortical interneurons to a structure outside cortex; from motor cortex to midbrain dopamine neurons, then it will happen. Evolution will not feel sorry that it\u2019s just ruined another set of textbooks.\n\nAnd it is just a giant bag of cells wired together. Our best evidence that it is not \u2014 that we can cling to our names of all the bits \u2014 come from studies where we cut a bit out or turn a bit off. When we cut out area X and we see a \u201cdeficit\u201d in behaviour Y of an animal (like tying its shoelaces), then we think \u201caha! Area X is for tying shoelaces\u201d. No. For starters, we never see a complete and permanent end to behaviour Y. We normally see that the animal is simply worse at doing or learning Y \u2014 not that it cannot do Y at all. The brain can carry on doing Y just fine, thanks, just not as well \u2014 there is massive redundancy in the brain. Like what you\u2019d find if it was a giant bag of cells, wired together.\n\nMoreover, seeing that behaviour Y gets worse logically tells us little about what area X is actually doing. It just tells us that damaging area X causes problems. Which on reflection isn\u2019t surprising as you just ripped a chunk out of the brain. The logical fallacy is simple to demonstrate. I am right now going to make a new startling new prediction of how the mouse brain works: the ventrolateral medulla is necessary for mice to learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food. Cut out the ventrolateral medulla, and a mouse will not learn to associate pictures of Benedict Cumberbatch with food.\n\nBecause it will be dead. The ventrolateral medulla contains the neurons which control the rhythm of breathing. Cut it out: no breathing. Ergo, no learning. Is the ventrolateral medulla a crucial brain area for learning? No. But by damaging it, we damage something vital to the process of learning. Thus, cutting a bit that we\u2019ve given a name can have an effect on that named thing, and we learn nothing at all. Except that we have damaged a big bag of cells, wired together.\n\nWhat\u2019s more remarkable is when cutting bits out has no effect. If we cut some bits of brain out before learning we see an effect \u2014 learning is made slower or worse or both; but when we cut them out after learning, it has no apparent effect whatsoever. These bits of brain have become completely redundant. Again: giant bag of cells, wired together \u2014 there are many ways within that bag of cells to solve the problem at hand, enough for the brain to just stop using a bit of itself altogether.\n\nAnd people get hyper-excited about finding odd signals where they were utterly unexpected. Like finding that reward changes activity in primary visual cortex. Or finding that sound is encoded in the hippocampus. These are great, interesting studies. But to be surprised by them is to fall into the naming fallacy. Evolution does not know nor care that we called this chunk of neurons the \u201chippocampus\u201d. It is just another bag of neurons, connected to many other bags of neurons.",

        "text": "This article is not intended to be a rant against the news media or Facebook. As I try to do with all my writing, I just want to suggest the possibility of a different perspective. I also want to present some data that supports my differing perspective.\n\nMy hypothesis about the current state of malaise and despair that we see so often around us is this: we have little to fear, but much about which to be anxious.\n\nTo repeat: we have little to fear, but much about which to be anxious.\n\nAccording to the American Psychology Association, fear and anxiety are two distinct mental states, caused by and causing different things:\n\nFear: n. a basic, intense emotion aroused by the detection of imminent threat, involving an immediate alarm reaction that mobilizes the organism by triggering a set of physiological changes. These include rapid heartbeat, redirection of blood flow away from the periphery toward the gut, tensing of the muscles, and a general mobilization of the organism to take action (see fear response; fight-or-flight response). Fear differs from anxiety in that the former is considered an appropriate short-term response to a present, clearly identifiable threat, whereas the latter is a future-oriented, long-term response focused on a diffuse threat.\n\nTo summarize, fear is an immediate alarm response to a real or perceived threat, which causes a distinct action. Anxiety is a long-term emotion which focuses not on a particular immediate threat, but a diffuse threat or threats that may or may not materialize, and which may or may not have a good response.\n\nThere are those among us who have good reason to fear the Coronavirus. And there are those with good reason to fear the economic meltdown going on right now. But I would argue that the state of confusion, panic and despair that we see so prevalent around us is not caused by fear, but anxiety.\n\nFear is a clean emotion. It comes, serves it\u2019s purpose, and departs. Fear is a survival instinct. Using myself as an example, I am afraid of snakes. If I happen across one on a walk in the woods, I will immediately back up, get a safe distance before turning my back, and then run like hell until I feel safe again. That is fear. I do not spend all day everyday wondering if I will encounter a snake, and dreading going out because there might be a snake in my path today. That is anxiety. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with in the world today.\n\nIf anything, I would argue that it would probably be a good thing if more people feared the Coronavirus, because then they would be compelled to comply with social distancing and quarantine guidance. If more people truly feared the economic crisis, they would act to shore up their family\u2019s wellbeing, they would make financial sacrifices before the next panic comes, and they would ensure they had a safety net in place.\n\nBut we are not truly afraid of these things, merely anxious. And as a result we do nothing, make no changes, learn no lessons, and so are doomed to repeat the same societal mistakes ad nauseum. Maybe, if we were more afraid and less anxious, we could put systems in place to provide better outcomes in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, in addition to our own human tendency to lethargy and torpor, we also have to contend with a gigantic media establishment that feeds off of anxiety and keeping us trapped in a haze of confusion and inaction. We see evidence of this in the way we have systemically turned away from any kind of journalistic standard in news and prefer to get our information from bloggers, Facebook and Twitter influencers. Somehow, we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe that we will hear the unvarnished truth from our \u201cfriends\u201d on the Internet, and never question whether or not these so-called \u201cfriends\u201d might not have an even more ingrained agenda than mainstream media does.\n\nWe are fed a constant stream of anxiety-fueling hot takes, breaking reports and opinion pieces disguised as news, much of it blatantly contradictory and even downright false, and we wonder why we can\u2019t ever seem to feel any peace or confidence, in ourselves, our neighbors, and our social institutions.\n\nPerhaps, as Franklin Roosevelt famously said, \u201cthe only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.\u201d because what\u2019s eating America and the rest of the world from the inside out is not a clean, healthy survival instinct. It is a toxic, cancerous anxiety that is perpetuated by ourselves, that stops us in our tracks and renders us powerless in the face of some pretty fearful things.\n\nTo get better, we have to start by being more afraid, of the right things, to be afraid of inaction, to be afraid of a lack of preparation. To be afraid of paralyzing anxiety.\n\nOnly then can we turn and begin to make changes to improve our safety and security. For so long as we live in anxiety as a society, we will never be safe.",

        "text": "Avoid Clickbait: Headline Techniques Used by Six Reputable Media Sites\n\nYes, you can draw in traffic without clickbait. Practical examples included\n\nIllustration by Cynthia Marinakos.\n\nAs I write this piece on the 19th of December 2020, Internet Live Stats has clocked over 4.5 billion Google searches. Roughly 306.4 billion emails were sent and received each day worldwide, according to statista.com.\n\nWith so many people searching for information and receiving emails, it\u2019s tough to break through the avalanche of content. Writers know they have to stand out with their headlines. It can be tempting to write headlines that seduce our potential readers with general statements. If this is what it takes to draw a little traffic to our work, why not?\n\nHow do you feel when you see countless headlines like these?\n\nTry These 3 Ways to Make Money Fast\n\nLearn To Play Piano Instantly: #1 Beginning Training\n\nThe Greatest Opportunity for Financial Advisers\n\nKerri-Anne\u2019s miracle: The news that shocked doctors\n\nOne man\u2019s unbelievable anniversary gift to his wife\n\nWhat happens when you fall for a widower\n\nToo many headlines like these are like buying a car from a used-car salesman. They might look great and sound like a good price. Yet we realize we\u2019ve been duped soon afterward with a lemon. We can\u2019t help but feel betrayed, angry. Our time has been wasted. And we\u2019ll never buy from that place or that person again. What\u2019s worse, we\u2019re more likely to be skeptical of all used-car salesmen in general and buy directly from buyers instead.\n\nClickbait headlines are headlines that bait readers into clicking by teasing, being intentionally vague, or deceptive in their promises.\n\nClickbait has been a significant issue in journalism. In 2015, Trinity Mirror, one of the UK\u2019s biggest newspaper publishers announced plans to set website \u201cclick\u201d targets for reporters. This led to concerns that headlines with a constant you won\u2019t believe what you\u2019re about to read approach is frustrating to online readers and would diminish the value of news with fluff and sensationalism. Unsurprisingly, these plans didn\u2019t go ahead.\n\nReputable media sites are wary of clickbait as they understand it damages the credibility of their content, their brands, and doesn\u2019t serve their readers. These sites are now valuable places to learn how to avoid clickbait headlines. Especially as writing headlines isn\u2019t a science. As writers, we can get better with our own headlines by identifying common characteristics behind headlines written by reputable media sites: BBC News, The Guardian, The New York Times, TIME, NBC News, and CBC.",

        "title": "How a Single Medium Article Received 100,000 Views",
        "text": "Many Medium writers are looking for exposure. While making money from the Medium Partner Program is a nice bonus, they primarily want their content to be seen and accessible.\n\nThe good news is \u2014 if you are a writer, as described above \u2014 it is actually very simple to generate massive traffic for your Medium story.\n\nMedium has extremely high Domain Authority (95/100).\n\nMedium Domain Authority | Casey Botticello\n\nDomain authority is a score that hints at the \u201cstrength\u201d and relevance of a website for a specific subject area or industry. It\u2019s a logarithmic scale of points, typically ranging from zero to 100, which predicts how well a website will rank on search engine result pages (SERPs). The higher the number of points, the higher a website\u2019s Domain Authority is.\n\nThis means that any content you publish from Medium is already given preferential treatment in search engines. This establishes the potential for large amounts of external traffic to your Medium article.\n\nThe Article with Over 100,000 Views\n\nThe article that I wrote which received over 100,000 views is How to Bypass Virtually Every News Paywall:\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that this article generated a decent amount of views because it was a timely answer to a popular online question. But it is surprising that it generated so many views.\n\nHow did this Medium article accomplish this?\n\nIt leveraged Medium\u2019s high domain authority and created content that was attractive to search engines.\n\nA staggering 97% of the total views received by this article were from external traffic sources. The vast majority of these external sources are search engines. Google alone, generated well over 80,000 views. Even less common search engine like DuckDuckGo generated over 1,000 views.\n\nDid this happen overnight? No. Even the best content will take weeks, if not months to achieve its optimal rank in most search engines.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots of my Medium article analytics, below, the article initially saw a surge of traffic a few days in.\n\nTraffic then remained flat for over a month before it jumped from being completely overlooked (Google Search Results Page 10+) to being somewhat accessible (Google Search Results Page 3\u20135). Also worth noting, the article was almost immediately indexed in Google after publication due to: (1) Medium being a publishing platform with high domain authority; (2) The initial surge of traffic ensured it would be indexed quickly.\n\nAs the article oscillates in page rank in Google\u2019s search algorithm, daily traffic continues to grow at a steady rate:\n\nNow, in May and June, several months after the initial article was published, traffic is still consistently growing with approximately 1,000 views per day!\n\nWhat caused this? Primarily, views continued to grow at a fairly steady pace as the article climbed page rank in Google\u2019s search engine. It gradually reached the bottom of the first page, then the number one spot on page 1, and finally it started becoming the featured snippet (position 0) in Google\u2019s Search results.\n\nHow to Optimize Your Medium Article\u2019s Search Engine Performance\n\nGoogle\u2019s algorithm evaluates a number of \u201con-page\u201d factors to determine what a page is about. These on-page ranking factors include the following:\n\nTitle\n\nSubheadings\n\nMeta description\n\nURL\n\nThe content of the article\n\nImage tags\n\nMedium provides writers with the ability to include a target keyword in each of these fields. If you want to generate huge amounts of external views, it is essential to optimize each of these fields.\n\nTitle\n\nA title tag is an HTML element that specifies the title of a web page. Title tags are displayed on search engine results pages (SERPs) as the clickable headline for a given result, and are important for usability, SEO, and social sharing. The title tag of a web page is meant to be an accurate and concise description of a page\u2019s content.\n\nGoogle typically displays the first 50\u201360 characters of a title tag. If you keep your titles under 60 characters, our research suggests that you can expect about 90% of your titles to display properly. There\u2019s no exact character limit, because characters can vary in width and Google\u2019s display titles max out (currently) at 600 pixels.\n\nof a title tag. If you keep your titles under 60 characters, our research suggests that you can expect about 90% of your titles to display properly. There\u2019s no exact character limit, because characters can vary in width and Google\u2019s display titles max out (currently) at 600 pixels. Avoid titles that are just a list of keywords or repeat variations of the same keyword over and over. These titles are bad for search users and could get you into trouble with search engines. Search engines understand variations of keywords, and it\u2019s unnecessary and counterproductive to stuff every version of your keyword into a title.\n\nAccording to Moz\u2019s testing and experience, keywords closer to the beginning of your title tag may have more impact on search rankings. In addition, user experience research shows that people may scan as few as the first two words of a headline. This is why they recommend titles where the most unique aspect of the page (e.g. the product name) appears first. Avoid titles like:\n\nBrand Name | Major Product Category \u2014 Minor Product Category \u2014 Name of Product\n\nTitles like this example front-load repetitive information and provide very little unique value at first glance. In addition, if search engines cut off a title like this, the most unique portion is the most likely to disappear.\n\nSubheadings\n\nA subheading, or subhead, are mini-headlines and play a huge role in capturing and holding the scanners attention. It also keeps them moving down the page from one subhead to the next.\n\nThe subheading would ideally be:\n\nUseful \u2014 it shows a promise and a benefit to the reader.\n\n\u2014 it shows a promise and a benefit to the reader. Unique \u2014 it contains a fact or opinion your reader may not be aware of.\n\n\u2014 it contains a fact or opinion your reader may not be aware of. Ultra-specific \u2014 this makes a subheading stand out and demand attention.\n\n\u2014 this makes a subheading stand out and demand attention. Urgent \u2014 urgency gets your reader to take notice and action.\n\nMeta Description\n\nThe meta description is an HTML attribute that provides a brief summary of a web page. Search engines such as Google often display the meta description in search results where they can highly influence user click-through rates.\n\nMeta descriptions can be any length, but Google generally truncates snippets to ~155\u2013160 characters. It\u2019s best to keep meta descriptions long enough that they\u2019re sufficiently descriptive, so we recommend descriptions between 50\u2013160 characters.\n\nA page\u2019s meta description should intelligently (read: in a natural, active, non-spammy way) employ the keywords that page is targeting, but also create a compelling description that a searcher will want to click. It should be directly relevant to the page it describes, and unique from the descriptions for other pages.\n\nURL\n\nA URL (Uniform Resource Locator), more commonly known as a \u201cweb address\u201d, specifies the location of a resource (such as a web page) on the internet. The URL also specifies how to retrieve that resource, also known as the \u201cprotocol\u201d, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.\n\nA well-crafted URL provides both humans and search engines an easy-to-understand indication of what the destination page will be about.\n\nURLs are a minor ranking factor search engines use when determining a particular page or resource\u2019s relevance to a search query. While they do give weight to the authority of the overall domain itself, keyword use in a URL can also act as a ranking factor.\n\nWell-written URLs can serve as their own anchor text when copied and pasted as links in forums, blogs, social media networks, or other online venues.\n\nArticle Content\n\nOn the Internet, content sends signals to visitors and search engines about the quality and purpose of a site. Good writing, images, and other forms of content help visitors engage with a site and can build trust. Meanwhile, duplicate content and keyword-stuffed copywriting can indicate that a site is low-quality or even spammy. Content, especially when created according to a defined content strategy, is a cornerstone of effective digital marketing.\n\nKeyword Research : If you want to generate traffic through search, it\u2019s best to do keyword research before you start writing. This way, you can focus on keywords for which a certain amount of search volume already exists \u2014 in other words, write toward topics (or find keyword niches!) that people are already searching for information about.\n\n: If you want to generate traffic through search, it\u2019s best to do keyword research before you start writing.

As I\u2019ve written about before, I love to use Signal. Signal auto-tweets your articles on repeat to help you share your articles and grow your audience on your schedule.\n\nImage Tags\n\nUp until recently, Medium did not allow proper image tagging. However, a few weeks ago, Medium added alt-text functionality, which allows writers to properly tag their images.\n\nIf you\u2019re creating content on a topic that requires the support of visuals, consider how your audience might prefer to find answers to their questions on that topic. In many cases, Google searchers don\u2019t want the classic blue, hyperlinked search result \u2014 they want the image itself, embedded inside your webpage.\n\nOne of the most important things image alt text can do for you is turn your images into hyperlinked search results \u2014 giving your website yet another way to receive organic visitors.",

        "title": "A Marketing Guide for Introverts",
        "text": "An introvert is a person who recharges when they are alone. Being around other people depletes their energy, being by themselves renews it.\n\nWriting is such solitary, interior work that it tends to attract introverts. We work well alone. And if we happen to have a little bit of ambivert in us \u2014 if we like to be around other people some \u2014 well, that\u2019s okay. We have our characters to keep us company.\n\nBut it\u2019s very, very rare to find a writer who gets excited about the part of the business of writing that requires a more extroverted personality. You know, the part where you have to stick your nose out of your writing cave and let other humans know you\u2019re alive.\n\nUh, huh. Marketing.\n\nUgh. Marketing. It\u2019s hard for everyone, but for introverts? For introverts, marketing is torture.\n\nEvery now and then I come across someone for whom the stars have aligned and they\u2019ve managed to find success (sometimes incredible success) without the need for a lot of marketing and they just kind of shrug and say Oh, marketing? I don\u2019t like it, so I just don\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.\n\nAnd I want to throat punch them. Metaphorically. Because I wouldn\u2019t really throat punch anyone. I\u2019m a pacifist.\n\nBut come on.\n\nOne percent of writers write the right thing at the right time and get it out in the right place, in front of the right people, and bam! Magic happens. They get rich and famous and they never have to market anything.\n\nHow nice for them. But counting on being one of those people is not a very good career plan.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like deciding you want to be an actress, so you start to hang out in soda shops, hoping to be discovered because it worked for Lana Turner.\n\nI really wish that the people who managed to find their way onto that magical path would at least acknowledge that it probably won\u2019t work for almost anyone else. Because it won\u2019t.\n\nNinety-nine percent of writers have to learn how to market, even if they are introverts who would rather seriously consider a career in accounting than think about marketing their own work.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about marketing.\n\nIt\u2019s not so scary.\n\nMarketing is just a conversation between you and your readers. If you can remember that, then you can manage your fear about it. It\u2019s not a magic trick. It\u2019s not a technique or a tactic or a strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s just a conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s you reaching out to readers who are into what you\u2019re writing and letting them know that you\u2019ve written a thing that they might be interested in. That\u2019s all. And that\u2019s not so scary.\n\nWhen you post a link to social media, you aren\u2019t bothering anyone. You\u2019re giving other people the opportunity to read something they might enjoy. If they aren\u2019t into it, they\u2019ll scroll past. No harm done.\n\nAnd trust me, they\u2019ll scroll. (Same as you scroll past hundreds of links a day. Maybe thousands.)\n\nWhen you run an ad, you\u2019re reaching out to other people just like you.\n\nYou aren\u2019t shoving your work up their noses. You aren\u2019t being pushy or obnoxious. You\u2019re doing what you\u2019re supposed to do. You\u2019re letting readers know that you\u2019ve written something for them.\n\nAnd if you do it right, you\u2019re letting readers who have asked to be made aware know that you\u2019ve written something. You\u2019re not bombarding everyone in creation. You\u2019re putting your link in front of people who follow you or who have read other things like what you\u2019ve written or who are interested in your topic.\n\nDeep breath. This is part of your job, and it\u2019s okay to do it.\n\nReaders are just people.\n\nThat\u2019s all. They are just human beings, same as you.\n\nAnd, here\u2019s the cool part. The ones you most want to reach are probably a lot like you. If you\u2019ve written a book, it\u2019s probably the kind of book you like to read. And if you\u2019d like to read it, then that means that other people like you would probably like to read it.\n\nSo all you have to do is think for a minute about how someone who has written a book like yours could reach you.\n\nWhat would make you want to read your own book?\n\nWhat makes you tell a friend oh, my God, you have to read this?\n\nWhat makes you click a link, instead of scrolling by?\n\nWhat makes you share?\n\nThe reason why marketing gets a bad rap is because so many people use it like a sledgehammer, when really, it\u2019s more like a Post-it note. No one wants to get smashed over the head. But who doesn\u2019t want the exact right thing stuck right where they need it?\n\nIntroverts have trouble being sledgehammers. All we want to do is go home and get in our pajamas! We don\u2019t want to hit anyone over the head with our books or anything else.\n\nBut we can stick a little reminder in the right place. A friendly little note that says Oh, hi! I wrote this thing. I think you\u2019re going to love it.\n\nAnd sometimes the sledgehammer is easy to ignore \u2014 because we\u2019re so used to dodging them. But those sticky notes, man. If you use them right, they\u2019re wonderful. They make you pay attention.\n\nDon\u2019t be slimy.\n\nThis should be obvious, but we both know it\u2019s not.\n\nWe know, because there are so many people out there willing to take $299 from us to teach us how to be slimy.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to trick people into buying your book. You don\u2019t have to slip in under the radar. You don\u2019t need to get fake bestseller statuses or elevate your social validation or whatever.\n\nAuthenticity is addictive. It\u2019s your best asset.\n\nWhen you spend money, make it count.\n\nIf you\u2019re an indie writer, learn how to use Amazon ads properly. Dave Chesson has a free course in how to that over at Kindlepreneur.\n\nThe best money you can spend as a writer is on a decent email server. I like Convertkit. Start building your email list today. I\u2019ve written a ton about email list building for writers, but you can start here.\n\nBryan Harris at Growth Tools (they used to be Videofruit) has a ton of amazing ideas for email list building that he offers for free. Just free. When I first started, I just took Bryan\u2019s ideas one at a time and did the work.\n\nIt was hard. Because I\u2019m an introvert and none of this shit is easy for me. But I did it and it worked. And it got easier.\n\nYou do not need to spend a lot of money on fancy ads or on schemes to make yourself a \u201cbestseller\u201d in a boxed set or hiring publicists. You do not need more than a simple website that you are probably capable of building yourself .\n\nHello, there. You should be blogging.\n\nYou\u2019re a writer. Words are your currency and your most available tool.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m stating the obvious here, but you should be blogging.\n\nIf you\u2019re a novelist, you might get a book into your reader\u2019s hands once a year give or take. Maybe. But with a blog, you can reach out to your readers any time you want to. Every week. Every day. Every time you have an idea.\n\nYou can be in conversation with them. And let me tell you, that\u2019s some exciting stuff. It\u2019s thrilling. If you give you readers a way to start following you, you\u2019ll start to notice that some of them are hardcore. They always show up for you.\n\nThey read what you write. They always read what you write.\n\nIf you have any doubt that your introverted self needs that, let me help you put that at rest.\n\nYou need it. Everyone needs it. It\u2019s the good stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s why we\u2019re here. It\u2019s why you\u2019re reading this article instead of happily writing in your journal or filing your short stories away on your hard drive.\n\nIt\u2019s why you care whether or not anyone reads your work.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject, please do not only blog about your own writing. No one wants to read that. It\u2019s boring.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, ask yourself this question: How many author blogs do you read that only talk about the author\u2019s process?\n\nRight.\n\nYou are an interesting person. There are things you\u2019re interested in. You\u2019re good at things. There are things you want to be good at. Write about those things.\n\nYou\u2019ll find your people. I promise.\n\nRemember that marketing has nothing to do with the quality of your work.\n\nIf you find yourself saying if I was good enough, I wouldn\u2019t need to market I want you to do something for me.\n\nGo to a mirror and look yourself squarely in the face. Now tell yourself to stop it. Right now.\n\nYou are wrong. And I swear, this is one of those times when if everyone would just listen to me, the world would be a happier place. Because there is exactly zero correlation between the quality of your work and the necessity for marketing.\n\nThe fact that you need to market your work does not mean that you\u2019re a shitty writer, just because you heard once that someone else doesn\u2019t have an email list and never markets anything.\n\nEveryone needs to market their work. The very, very few lucky souls who have somehow been able to count on luck to give them a career \u2014 we can\u2019t recreate their success.\n\nHell, they can\u2019t recreate their success.\n\nThat means that you\u2019re normal and they\u2019re weird.\n\nSince you can\u2019t predict being at the exact right place at the exact right time with the exact right piece of work \u2014 you\u2019re going to have to count on your own ability to let people know you\u2019ve written a thing.\n\nIf you do manage to get struck by lightning, awesome. But two things. One \u2014 since you didn\u2019t hitch your wagon to that star, you won\u2019t be dependent on it, so if at some point it stops dragging you along, you\u2019ll be fine. Two \u2014 even those lucky few who don\u2019t have to market their work would do even better if they knew how to reach out to their readers.\n\nI mean, do you really, really want to be the writer who gets to be famous and never has to interact with the people who love them? Are you sure about that?\n\nBecause that sounds pretty lonely to me. There\u2019s a difference between lonely and introverted.\n\nIt also sounds like the excuse we use to let ourselves off the marketing hook because marketing is hard, especially for introverts, and we don\u2019t want to do it.\n\nThe need to market your work doesn\u2019t make you less of a writer, because there is no correlation between the quality of your writing and the need or lack of need for marketing.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, go pick up a copy of 50 Shades of Grey. Or go pick up any National Book Award winner that\u2019s sold less than 5000 copies.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to focus on the parts that are easier for you.\n\nI like blogging. I\u2019m pretty good at Facebook. I adore my email list. Email marketing is my sweetspot. When I reach out to my email list, I feel like I\u2019m talking to friends.\n\nI suck at video, but I\u2019m working at it and I\u2019m getting better. If there are other people there, I can do it pretty well. I still haven\u2019t mastered video when it\u2019s just me talking into a camera. I end up sounding like a lunatic.\n\nI can do an ad if I have to, but I\u2019m not a great copywriter.\n\nThat\u2019s my skillset. Yours is probably different.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. No one is good at everything. And no one has to be.\n\nIf you\u2019re great at audio, then do audio. If video is your thing, figure out how to market with video. If you\u2019re completely inexperienced, pick something and just start. It\u2019s okay if you suck at the beginning.\n\nHere\u2019s a secret for you: in the beginning, no one\u2019s paying attention anyway.\n\nThe few people who will see your early efforts at marketing won\u2019t care if you screw up. So take a deep breath and don\u2019t worry so much. Stick your nose out of your introverted writer\u2019s lair and accept that you\u2019re going to have to give some form of marketing a shot.\n\nYou\u2019ll get better at this.\n\nIt might not seem like it now, but marketing is a skill and like any other skill, the more you do it, the better you\u2019ll get at it. Even if the idea of marketing makes you want to hide under your covers.\n\nEventually you\u2019ll understand how ads work. You\u2019ll be a master blogger. You\u2019ll know how to write an email to your followers without sounding like a robot. You\u2019ll look up one day and realize that you actually like that conversation between you and your readers.\n\nMaybe it won\u2019t ever be your favorite thing. Maybe you\u2019ll dream about the day when you\u2019re rich and famous enough to pass it off to someone else. (But, when you get there, you\u2019ll only have more marketing to do!)\n\nBut you will get better at it.\n\nHere are a few first steps.",

        "title": "How to Add Upscribe Forms to Your Medium Posts",
        "text": "I\u2019ve been asked several times how to add email sign-up forms to Medium blog posts, so I thought I\u2019d write up a quick little how-to.\n\nThe Big Question: Yes. Medium allows forms behind the paywall.\n\nI emailed Medium a while back to ask if it\u2019s okay to put an email sign-up form on posts that are part of the Medium Partnership Program.\n\nHere\u2019s the response I got:\n\nSo. Quick and to the point. Thanks, Tobias!\n\nWhat that means is that you can get paid for Medium posts, even if they include an Upscribe form.\n\nSince the only purpose of an Upscribe form is to capture email addresses, Medium will allow you to invite readers to your list via a form on a post behind the paywall.\n\nMy feeling is that because Medium\u2019s guidelines include the note below, they\u2019ve left it open for them to remove your post from the Partnership Program (meaning, your post would not be behind the paywall and you wouldn\u2019t be paid \u2014 but your post would still be available to read) if they decide that there\u2019s too much marketing going on.\n\nFrom Medium\u2019s guidelines.\n\nMedium strives to provide paying members with an ad-free reading experience. Part of that means they keep posts that explicitly ask for money (including claps or donations \u2014 for instance linking to a commercial site like Etsy) are not allowed.\n\nPosts With Forms Are Allowed, But Not Often Curated\n\nThis is my own personal experience \u2014 so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nIt seems to me that Medium allows forms, for sure. I\u2019ve had email confirmation and I\u2019ve never had a post with a form in it either removed from the partnership program or brought to my attention as a violation.\n\nThat said, though, my posts with forms are rarely (almost never) curated. Which means they are not as well distributed by Medium as posts that don\u2019t have a form.\n\nThe posts that include a form and are curated always include forms that are directly linked to the post. For instance, a form that promises something directly linked to the post you\u2019re writing.\n\nFor instance, if I\u2019m writing about a tool that I\u2019ve developed for writers, I can include a form a reader can use to get a free copy and Medium might still curate that post.\n\nIncluding that form, though, makes it much more likely that my post will not be curated.\n\nSo, I have to be conscious of the purpose of my post. Sometimes I write something that I know will convert well to my email list and it\u2019s worth it to have a form, even if it means forgoing curation. Sometimes I want my posts to have wider distribution and the form isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nHow To Use Upscribe to Post Forms on Medium\n\nOkay, here\u2019s the how-to part.\n\nGo to Upscribe and sign up. There is a free version that allows you 100 form views per month and does not include integration with your email server. It costs $9 per month for up to 5000 views per month and integration.\n\nIntegrate Upscribe with your email server. To do that, click \u2018integrate\u2019 at the top of the screen. Choose your server and follow the directions. Upscribe will walk you right through it.\n\nOnce you\u2019re integrated, you can set Upscribe so that your new form connects directly to your email server and you won\u2019t have to manually upload new subscribers to your email list.\n\nClick \u2018Create New Form\u2019 to start building your form. It\u2019s super easy to design your form. Just change the wording. Click save. And that\u2019s it. Your form is ready to use.\n\nPost your form. You can either post your form directly on Medium or hyperlink text to a form that will open in a new tab.\n\nTo post your form directly, copy the link Upscribe provides. Past it where you want your form to appear. Hit your enter key. The form will automagically populate.\n\nWhen you go to the \u2018my forms\u2019 page on Upscribe, you\u2019ll see all your forms. Each one has a \u2018copy link\u2019 button. Just click that button, then paste the link into your Medium post where you want the form to show up.\n\nScreenshot of my Upscribe forms. (Photo: Author)\n\nSo when I paste this link:\n\nhttps://upscri.be/e1292d/\n\nAnd then hit enter, this form shows up:\n\nVoila. (That\u2019s a live form.)\n\nAlternatively, you can write text inviting people to join your list. When you highlight it, a small bar will pop up with a link symbol. Click that and input the link you copied from Upscribe.\n\nFor instance: Join the waiting list for my workshops.\n\nThere you go! No go forth and build your email list.",

        "text": "The Power of Sleep in Learning: Mind-Blowing Science\n\nMany people, sadly, haven\u2019t unlocked this potential their whole lives\n\nW e all know sleep is important for (mental) health, but what do the numbers say?\n\nAccording to the book:\n\nSleeping well can boost your learning with 20 to 40% in comparison to those who are sleep-deprived.\n\nThe problem, however, is that it\u2019s hard for long-term sleep-deprived people to know they are sleep-deprived. However, according to the book, just 1 hour of less sleep for 10 nights is sufficient to make your performance equivalent to someone who is drunk. This includes driving, learning, reaction time, and so on.\n\nOne hour of less sleep every day, sadly, is a reality for many people and especially students.\n\nSo how does sleep enhance learning?\n\nThe Mechanics of Sleep In Learning\n\nFirst of all, as we progress throughout the day learning new stuff, they are mostly stored in the hippocampus. This brain region, however, has a relatively small space to store memories and can get full quickly.\n\nWhat happens during sleep, is that these memories either get transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex (which has a much bigger storage space) or they get removed.\n\nSee: Memory consolidation, Wikipedia for more information\n\nA lack of sleep results in your hippocampus not being completely emptied (or almost) nor are your memories that well consolidated (strengthened). This, in turn, makes it harder to learn and remember new things the next day.\n\nSleep and Productivity\n\nI f you had to choose between earning $80,000 a year while working normal hours and getting good sleep versus $140,000 while working insane hours and only sleep 6 hours a day, what would you choose?\n\nMost people would choose the latter. The book, however, teaches that you can get both in the long-term, namely earning $140,000 while sleeping well every night.\n\nWhy? Because you make less errors, are much more creative, and so on when having slept well.\n\nThis, too, counts for studying and learning things.\n\nDon\u2019t sacrifice quality for quantity.\n\nImproving Your Sleep Quality\n\nFor those interested, Bill Gates wrote a review on the same book mentioning tips to improve your sleep quality:",

        "title": "AI analyzes language to predict schizophrenia",
        "text": "A machine learning method uncovered a hidden clue in people\u2019s language predictive of the later manifestation of psychosis: the frequent use of words associated with sound. A paper published by the journal npj Schizophrenia released the findings by scientists from Emory University and Harvard University.\n\nHidden details\n\nThe researchers developed a new machine-learning methodology to more precisely quantify the semantic richness of people\u2019s conversational language (a known indicator for psychosis). Their results indicated that automated analysis of the two language variables (more frequent use of words associated with sound and speaking with low semantic density, or vagueness) can predict if an at-risk person will later develop psychosis with an impressive 93 percent accuracy.\n\nTrained clinicians had not noticed how individuals at risk for psychosis use more words associated with sound than the average population, though abnormal auditory perception is a pre-clinical symptom.\n\n\u201cVoices: Living with Schizophrenia\u201d by WebMD, YouTube.\n\nMachine learning can spot patterns in people\u2019s use of language that even doctors who have undergone training to diagnose and treat those at risk of psychosis may not notice. \u201cTrying to hear these subtleties in conversations with people is like trying to see microscopic germs with your eyes,\u201d says first study author Neguine Rezaii, a fellow in the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. That being said, it is possible to use machine learning to find subtle patterns hiding in people\u2019s language. \u201cIt\u2019s like a microscope for warning signs of psychosis,\u201d she adds. Rezaii started working on the study while she was a resident in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cTrying to hear these subtleties in conversations with people is like trying to see microscopic germs with your eyes,\u201d Neguine Rezaii, fellow in the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBehind the data\n\nResearchers first used machine learning to establish \u201cnorms\u201d for conversational language. They fed a computer software program the online conversations of 30,000 users of Reddit, a popular social media platform where people have informal discussions about a wide array of sujects. The software program, known as Word2Vec, utilizes an algorithm to change individual words to vectors, assigning each one a location in a semantic space based on its meaning. Such with similar meanings are positioned closer together than those with different meanings.\n\nThey also developed a computer program to perform \u201cvector unpacking,\u201d or analysis of the semantic density of word usage. Previous work has measured semantic coherence between sentences. Vector unpacking enabled the researchers to quantify how much information was packed into each sentence. After generating a baseline of \u201cnormal\u201d data, the researchers applied the same techniques to diagnostic interviews of 40 participants that had been conducted by trained clinicians, as part of the multi-site North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS), funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nVector unpacking enabled the researchers to quantify how much information was packed into each sentence.\n\nThe automated analyses of the participant samples were then compared to the normal baseline sample and the longitudinal data on whether the participants converted to psychosis.\n\n\"This research is interesting not just for its potential to reveal more about mental illness, but for understanding how the mind works\u201d concludes senior author Phillip Wolff, a professor of psychology at Emory.",

        "title": "Should You Stay In Your Lane as a Writer?",
        "text": "Stay in your lane can mean a couple of things.\n\nSometimes it means minding your own business. Keeping your head down and just doing your own thing and not worrying about what other people are doing.\n\nSometimes it means staying within the boundaries of a field of focus \u2014 especially if you\u2019re an entrepreneurial type. Being a specialist, instead of a jack-of-all-trades.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those platitudes that kind of hits me wrong \u2014 but also sort of makes sense.\n\nI mean, if you know what it is you want to do, it makes sense to focus on that and do it really well. Willy nilly branching out can be problematic.\n\nI\u2019ve had friends try so hard to make a go of writing and fail because they couldn\u2019t settle into a groove.\n\nBut I kind of hate the idea of someone else telling me that I have to stay in my own lane. Especially with regard to writing.\n\nOne of the things I love about blogging is that I can write about any old thing that comes to my mind and there isn\u2019t anyone to tell me I can\u2019t.\n\nAnd if Neil Gaiman can write everything from picture books to books for adults, why can\u2019t I?\n\nMaybe I won\u2019t have as many readers when I write about certain topics. Maybe I won\u2019t be paid as much. But if I learn something or I enjoy myself or have an interest in establishing myself in that lane (so to speak) then that\u2019s okay.\n\nFor writers, I think there\u2019s room for both having a lane \u2014 or a niche \u2014 and also exploring outside of that lane.\n\nThe key is to know where your lane is, so that you can branch out on your own terms.\n\nIf you\u2019re a non-fiction writer, your lane is the topic or topics that you write about regularly and with authority.\n\nFor instance, my non-fiction writing lanes are writing in general, but especially fiction writing. Also online business, productivity, and the business of writing.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure, or you\u2019re a new writer, ask yourself these questions:\n\nWhat are you good at?\n\nWhat could you teach someone else?\n\nWhat do people come to you for help with?\n\nWhat do you spend your time learning?\n\nWhat are you passionate about?\n\nWhat topic did you read the most about last year?\n\nOne way to find your lane is to post this on social media:\n\nWhat do you think I\u2019m good at?\n\nI get it. It\u2019s going to feel seriously awkward. Like you\u2019re fishing for compliments. But if you can\u2019t figure it out for yourself, you\u2019ll get some interesting responses if you\u2019re brave enough.\n\nIf you\u2019ve written blog posts already on a pretty broad array of topics, take a look at the analytics for them. Which are getting the most traffic? Which are getting the most interaction from readers?\n\nThose posts are probably written in your lane.\n\nDid you have fun writing them? This is an important question, because none of this matters if you\u2019re not having fun.\n\nYour lane is the lane where you want to be.\n\nLet me say that one more time.\n\nYour lane is the lane where you want to be.\n\nEven if you are an absolute authority in a specific topic and you could teach the whole world something about it, if you don\u2019t want to write about it, it\u2019s not your lane.\n\nYou do not want to get yourself in a situation where you\u2019ve built an audience who is expecting work from you on a specific subject and you\u2019re making money writing on that subject \u2014 and you hate the work.\n\nBy the way, this goes for fiction writers as well. I\u2019ve known fiction writers who\u2019ve found success writing books they weren\u2019t happy writing and struggled to shift gears.\n\nThat\u2019s a trap that\u2019s very difficult to get out of.\n\nSo, one more time for the writers in the back. Your lane is the lane where you want to be. Even if that\u2019s not the lane where you are currently an expert.\n\nWe\u2019re clear on that, right?\n\nChanging Lanes Out of Impatience\n\nHere\u2019s what I see happen pretty often.\n\nA writer starts writing on a subject they like a lot. They write a few posts. Or maybe they write an ebook. Or they write a novel. And they don\u2019t get the kind of traction they want.\n\nNothing goes viral. Or they don\u2019t make any money. (Or not as much as they thought they would) Or the book they self-published flops. Or they don\u2019t get an agent.\n\nSo, they change lanes.\n\nThey start writing on a different topic. And nothing goes viral, etc.\n\nThey don\u2019t feel like this lane works for them the way they want it to, either.\n\nSo they change lanes. Again.\n\nThe problem is that this person is trying to get from point A to point Z and they keep getting off at the first exit and going back to the start, then taking a different route.\n\nThey\u2019re moving, and they\u2019re logging miles, but they\u2019re not actually making progress. They aren\u2019t sticking with anything long enough to actually get good at it.\n\n(Their starts might be getting better though, after doing them so many times. So there\u2019s that.)\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about Neil Gaiman and his writing everything from picture books through adult novels. Somewhere in the beginning of his learning how to write, he stuck with something long enough to become a good writer. Then he branched out.\n\nI remember reading that he had the idea for The Graveyard Book (a young adult book) for twenty years and had to wait until he was a good enough writer to actually write it.\n\nChanging Lanes With Intention\n\nWhat if, instead of changing lanes completely, because you\u2019re impatient with how things are going, you changed lanes with intention.\n\nYou start out writing in your lane, about the topic that you\u2019re very sure you want to write about. The lane you love.\n\nThen, sometimes you branch out and add a new lane.\n\nThese are sometimes called shoulders, especially if they\u2019re semi-related to the topic you\u2019re already writing about. If I write about marketing, for instance, I\u2019m writing in a shoulder lane to writing.\n\nWriting middle grade is kind of a shoulder of writing young adult. It\u2019s different, but not like crazy different.\n\nBut sometimes I write about my eating disorder. Or about taking care of my parents-in-law who both have Alzheimer\u2019s and live with my husband and I. Or about being a soccer mom.\n\nI\u2019m knocking around an idea for a picture book about a spider that lives outside my office window.\n\nThose are topics that are just entirely outside of my lane.\n\nWhen I write on those topics, it\u2019s because I have something I want to say. I know that those posts will get less traffic than blog posts that I write that are in my lane. But I don\u2019t mind.\n\nThere are real benefits to leaving your lane sometimes.\n\nTaking a break from my lane keeps you sharp. You might have to do research when you write about something you\u2019re less familiar with. You\u2019ll have to think in different ways. That\u2019s good for your brain.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll find connections between the lanes sometimes that you never would have seen otherwise. That\u2019s always very cool.\n\nAnd it\u2019s fun. It feeds the rebel soul.",

        "title": "How The Media Can Prevent Copycat Suicides",
        "text": "How The Media Can Prevent Copycat Suicides\n\nResponsible reporting around celebrity suicide goes a long way\n\nPhoto by Reagan Freeman on Unsplash\n\nThe celebrity death I was most impacted by was Chester Bennington. Chester was the lead singer of Linkin Park, my favorite band as a kid, and the lead behind my favorite songs that would play over and over again on my iPod: \u201cNumb\u201d and \u201cIn the End.\u201d I was in Japan, working in an organic chemistry lab, but at the time, the news devastated me \u2014 Chester had died on July 20, 2017, by suicide.\n\nBut I had grown enough in my mental health awareness that I feared the media reporting and a possible contagion effect from that reporting. According to Gunn et al. in a 2018 study in the Archives of Suicide Research, widely publicized suicides like Robin Williams (2014) and Aaron Hernandez (2017) were associated with increased Google.com/trends data on \u201chow to suicide\u201d and \u201csuicide prevention.\u201d The authors attributed the increase in searches following Williams\u2019s death to the Werther Effect, a spike of emulation or copycat suicides after a widely publicized suicide, and the death of Hernandez to the Papageno effect, an increase in awareness and support in suicide prevention.\n\nThe contagion effect is synonymous with the Werther Effect. The Werther effect, according to blogger Alexa Moody, was coined in the late 1700s after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s book, The Sorrows of Young Werther. In the book, the protagonist, Werther, finds himself in a love triangle and believes the only way to make it out is through suicide \u2014 although the book was widely commercially successful, the success of the book led to many copycat suicides of fans of Goethe deciding to take their own lives as well.\n\nThe Papageno effect is on the opposite side of the spectrum. Its etymology is after a character Mozart\u2019s \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d where a character loses his love and plans suicide as a result. The attempt is stopped last minute by three boys who support him and tell him there are alternatives to suicide and is a positive effect the media can have on suicide.\n\nWhen Chester Bennington died, suicide experts feared a contagion effect. Zach Schonfeld in Newsweek reports that Bennington\u2019s death shocked people since many believe that wealthy and successful people don\u2019t struggle with depression and anxiety, like other people. But depression is a disease that can affect anyone. In the words of Theresa Buhse, the associate executive director of the Long Island Crisis Center:\n\n\u201cJust because somebody is rich and famous does not necessarily mean that they\u2019re happy at all\u2026The truth is, we never know what is going on in somebody\u2019s mind. People struggle with mental illness. People struggle with depression. It doesn\u2019t matter how rich they are. It doesn\u2019t matter how famous they are. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nChester\u2019s death was its own example of the contagion effect. Chester died on what would have been Cornell\u2019s 53rd birthday, and Cornell also died by suicide years earlier. Buhse notes that it might have been a coincidence, but people also may plan out an emotionally significant date.\n\nCelebrity suicides sometimes have a contagion effect on the general population as well. When Marilyn Monroe died from probable suicide in 1962, the suicide rate jumped by 12 percent compared to the same months the previous year. To this day, the death of Marilyn Monroe resulted in the most copycat suicide attempts. According to Margot Sanger-Katz in the New York Times, the publicity surrounding suicide has been linked with subsequent increases in suicide, especially for young people. Analysis suggests that at least five percent of youth suicides are influenced by contagion. What irresponsible media coverage does is harm people already vulnerable and at risk for suicide.\n\nFor the media to avoid the contagion, Sanger-Katz notes that suicide prevention advocates want news media coverage to avoid emphasizing or glamorizing suicide or make it seem like an inevitable solution for people at risk. Media reports also should not fixate on graphic details of the death, and in the case of Chester, one media source prominently highlighted his method of suicide.\n\n1962 is very different from 2020, and the media has come a long way in being responsible and diligent. Schonfeld talks about the suicide of Kurt Cobain in 1994, where experts feared a nationwide copycat effect. However, media outlets reported warning signs and provided hotline numbers, and the number of suicides in the Seattle region decreased after Cobain died, assisted by a rise in calls to local crisis centers.\n\nAccording to Luna Greenstein at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Anthony Bourdain\u2019s suicide came only two days after the media irresponsibly reported on Kate Spade\u2019s suicide.\n\nTakeaways\n\nTo talk about suicide in a way that encourages people to get help and look for help, Greenstein recommends including local and national hotline numbers, as well as other crisis resources. Other recommendations include informing, not sensationalizing. Any headline of a celebrity\u2019s death should not include suicide in the headline, and images of the method or location of death should be avoided. Instead, photos of school, work, or family can be used instead.\n\nGreenstein also recommends choosing words carefully, using words like \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201crise\u201d rather than more sensational words like \u201cepidemic\u201d or \u201cskyrocketing.\u201d And terminology around suicide is important as well \u2014 the field is moving away from \u201ccommitted suicide\u201d and moving more around terms that do not stigmatize suicide as a crime, like \u201cdied by suicide,\u201d \u201ccompleted suicide,\u201d \u201ckilled him/herself,\u201d and \u201cended his/her life.\u201d\n\nLastly, Greenstein recommends reporting on suicide as a public health issue. Suicide shouldn\u2019t be reported the same way a crime is reported, and seeking advice from suicide prevention experts is more important than quoting police and first responders. Including the warning signs of suicide as well as a \u201cwhat to do\u201d sidebar.\n\n\u201cThis is not a matter of being \u2018politically correct.\u2019 It\u2019s a matter of saving lives,\u201d Greenstein says.\n\nWe can also watch how we talk about suicide in personal circles as well using these guidelines. Just like obituaries talk mostly about how someone lived rather than how someone died, and although talking about suicide is difficult and often uncomfortable, suicide is the second leading cause of death for people aged 10 to 34 in the United States. Responsible reporting and conversation on suicide are essential.",

        "title": "Thoughts on a medical mystery",
        "text": "Thoughts on a medical mystery\n\nHow brains learn diseases, and their cures\n\nMy father is a pediatric neurologist, with a speciality in epilepsy. He\u2019s always loved the kids he worked with, and treated them like family. Whenever one of his patients died, he\u2019d bring me and my sisters to their funeral. Some I\u2019d known for years from tagging along on rounds, or having watched them grow up through the quanta of Christmas cards and back-to-school photos. I remember the funeral of a girl my age, who had been far more outgoing and lively than me, her now-dark face caked in yellow makeup. Though they\u2019d never found a drug that could control her seizures, she\u2019d seemed otherwise healthy and normal, and her death had come as a total surprise. This was my first brush with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory seizures, and remains one of the most devastating mysteries in the field of epilepsy. There are currently no known biomarkers to identify patients at risk for SUDEP \u2014 hence the Sudden, hence the Unexpected.\n\nHaving come to neuroscience by way of physics, I confess I often forget a crucial point: neurons are cells, not just immutable contact points on a circuit board over which voltage plays in prescribed patterns. Not only is the circuit board layout shifting, always rewiring itself in learning, but activity sets off internal programs within cells, making them more or less active, or plastic, tuning their metabolism and protein production. Furthermore, at the gross level, the brain isn\u2019t a black box sealed in the skull, but exerts its influence on every conceivable bodily process. Neurological disorders are rarely, if ever, confined to the brain. This may seem obvious, but it bears consideration. When brain areas are over or under-active, this can reverberate through other somatic systems, causing plastic changes in all manner of body parts: neurons love to learn. In fact, non-neuronal cells learn too: signals like oxygen or nutrition levels can alter a cell\u2019s transcriptional landscape, resulting in tissue remodelling, for example.\n\nEpilepsy is particularly interesting, as it\u2019s a prime example of a learned disease. \u201cKindling\u201d is a common idea in the literature: once someone has had one or more seizures, they\u2019re much more likely to become epileptic, as the brain learns this problematic activity pattern. Some epileptic patients report that they\u2019ve discovered certain thought patterns that help them control or minimize an oncoming seizure (these patients feel a pre-ictal \u2018aura\u2019 that clues them in), so we know there may be conscious strategies which certain patients can use to volitionally control their disease. But I\u2019d argue that neural circuits may have evolved or learned other, less helpful ways of suppressing disease-related activity\u2014in the case of uncontrollable epilepsy, through depriving the brain of oxygen, thereby quenching activity. I posit we might use this framing of brains and bodies \u2018learning\u2019 their own cures to better understand common comorbidities of neurological disorders.\n\nSUDEP is a big clue in this. It\u2019s increasingly evident that cardio-pulmonary issues underlie a majority of SUDEP cases. While most SUDEP events go unwitnessed, in a retrospective study of observed SUDEP cases caught while patients were in the hospital, researchers found that patient breathing ceased before heart failure in all 16 observed events (Rivlin et al., 2013). There is no doubt that SUDEP involves a complex network of effects, but the effect of repeated exposure to low oxygen levels (chronic intermittent hypoxia) is consistent with many of the known abnormalities of SUDEP patients (Giaccia, Simon, & Johnson, 2004). Hypoxia has a profound effect on tissues, from altering the physiology of certain ion channels in the heart and lungs to long-term changes in genetic transcription and vascular remodeling (Kemp & Peers, 2007; Ling et al., 2001; Nei, 2009; Richerson, 2010). Up to 40% of SUDEP cases present cardiac fibrosis in autopsy, which can be a result of chronic intermittent hypoxia (Ling et al., 2001; P-Codrea, et al., 2005), and damage was most commonly found in the heart structure most vulnerable to ischemic damage (the subendocardial myocardium, for the keen). SUDEP patients also tend to have had post-seizure cerebral depression, which is also strongly linked with hypoxia (Takano et al., 2007). All of this suggests that recurring low oxygen levels might be the cause of the myriad tissue and neural remodeling events that ultimately result in patient death.\n\nThe link between epilepsy and breathing problems is well documented, but not well understood. In some patients, epileptic activity may simply affect brain stem circuits controlling breathing. Every patient has a different locus of seizure activity \u2014 the part of the brain a seizure plays out on. But SUDEP doesn\u2019t only happen in patients whose seizures originate in the part of the brain that controls breathing. There may be a more fundamental physiological link underlying seizures and breathing: blood acidification, as happens in hypoxic conditions, is anti-convulsive. Thus, the hypoxic response may not simply be a direct effect of a seizure on the brain stem, but an evolved mechanism, or one learned by neural circuits, to shut down epileptic activity during otherwise intractable seizures [1]. This then leads to a vicious cycle: breathing circuits are plastic throughout life, and strongly shaped by hypoxia (So, 2008), so even if a patient\u2019s seizures never directly reach the brain stem, their chronic seizures could still cause a gradual degradation of the neural circuits controlling breathing through repeated hypoxia [2]. The brain, then, might be learning activity patterns that help control a particular disease state, which is adaptive in the short term but ultimately deleterious: a drastic stop-gap to manage otherwise intractable epilepsy.\n\nThe brain is sometimes too good at doing its job. Many neurological diseases involve some component of being \u2018learned\u2019 by neural circuits: chronic pain, neuropathy/neuralgia, and migraine all come to mind. When considering how to find predictive biomarkers for neurological conditions, or how to address their symptoms, it\u2019s crucial to remember that neurological diseases don\u2019t live in the brain alone. They can affect all body systems, and some of the most deleterious symptoms might result from the brain attempting to \u2018medicate\u2019 itself with whatever other systems it has control over. Studies with this framing in mind might help lead to the discovery of simple interventions, and further refine our understanding to identify functional and molecular biomarkers of medical mysteries such as SUDEP [3].\n\nNotes",

Suddenly, life is poetry and joy opens up portal into new universes that leave you speechless. Unless you surrender to it, you cannot experience awe; that surrender is not verbal. Transcription takes place well after the facts and always feels like an unreliable witness account.\n\nFinding yourself writing love letters to life as a chronic depressive freelancer on the verge of financial collapse is weird but I\u2019m here for it. Against the stark backdrop of death and destruction, life is more beautiful than ever, and I am, dare I say it, content.\n\nThere is so much gentleness in the generosity of acceptance, it frees up mental bandwidth for everything else. The moment is as impermanent as life. To not celebrate it would be an affront to hope, the same hope that has seen me through everything so far.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t be here anymore but I am. Despair has shades and nuances, hope is blinding, and I have been dazed and confused since I set aside the past and embraced the present almost two years ago.\n\nHope is the blank page beckoning your heart to release its findings.\n\nSo others might benefit from them.",

        "title": "How To Rewire Your Brain To Succeed During Uncertain Times",
        "text": "When you have a thought for the very first time, it passes and generally doesn\u2019t have too much of an impact on you. However, when it is repeated, your subconscious begins to perceive it not as an observation, but as an important fact that needs to be embedded into the framework of your daily life \u2014 an idea that you should, at some level, be constantly aware of.\n\nWhat we are most keen to adopt into that mindset are often worst case scenarios, deep fears, paralyzing insecurities, and anything else we imagine might possibly be a threat to us. Unfortunately, the majority of our daily actions, decisions and outcomes stem from that same place in your subconscious where all of that automation is being stored.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is being driven by that automatic program,\u201d Dr. Irvine says.\n\nHowever, there is hope. She\u2019s used the following process to train 7 and 8-figure earning entrepreneurs not only to achieve greater levels of career success, but to mend relationships, find deep fulfillment, and free themselves of \u201cstressed success,\u201d where you are accomplished on the surface, but unhappy just beneath.\n\nOur job now, she says, is to do some serious inner-work.\n\nHow to remove limiting thoughts\n\nDr. Irvine explains that its the moments most of us avoid \u2014 tension, resistance, or cognitive dissonance \u2014 that offer us the greatest opportunity for change.\n\n\u201cAt these times, we are actually aware of what we are saying to ourselves all along.\u201d She uses the following four step process with her clients while coaching them to use challenges as opportunities for real and lasting change.\n\nFirst, recognize the thought.\n\nThe biggest problem for most of us is that we aren\u2019t even aware of what we are telling ourselves all day.\n\n\u201cMost high-performers go around and think, who am I to do this, most people have imposter syndrome,\u201d Dr. Irvine explains. Then, they just try to out-work, disprove or avoid it. None of these tactics work, because by trying to suppress it, it stays automated.\n\nInstead, we need to just get clear on what we are thinking, and ultimately, what we really believe about ourselves.\n\nSecond, record the thought.\n\nWriting the thought down actually \u201cpulls it out\u201d of your subconscious, Dr. Irvine explains.\n\nWhen people display resistance towards this, it is because of the idea that \u201cwhat we focus on grows,\u201d or that by writing it down, we are legitimizing or making it more real or likely than it was before. Not so.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s already running 80 to 90 percent of your day. There\u2019s nothing more important than recognizing it for what it is.\u201d\n\nThird, refute the thought.\n\nThe best thing about our brains, she explains, is that as soon as we are aware of the thought, we will naturally begin to challenge it.\n\n\u201cBy saying it out loud, we see it as the lie it is,\u201d Dr. Irvine shares.\n\nIf that\u2019s challenging, try to imagine someone you deeply love and care for (the kind of person you\u2019d \u201cjump in front of a bus for,\u201d she says) and then picture saying the thought to them. What this does is remove your negativity bias, which she estimates has us believe 9 times more negative thoughts about ourselves than anyone else.\n\nWhen we imagine applying the thought to someone else, we see how limiting and destructive it can be.\n\nFourth, record yourself speaking the new thought.\n\nThe final and most powerful step is to re-wire your thinking.\n\nDr. Irvine suggests doing so by actually recording yourself speaking your new ideas in the present tense (perhaps on your phone) and then listening to it in the morning and before bed. \u201cYou\u2019re building a new network in your brain around the truth, around the old belief. You\u2019re showing your subconscious that you\u2019re not aligning with that anymore,\u201d she says.\n\nHow to rewire your brain to succeed amid uncertainty\n\nThis process becomes vital during times of uncertainty, such as we are facing right now.\n\nOur brain\u2019s first instinct is to \u201cseek the familiar,\u201d Dr. Irvine says. \u201cWhen everything changes and everything is uncertain and nothing is controllable, our brains are doing what they are wired to do, they are kicking into fight or flight mode\u2026 there\u2019s a tiger in the room, so run,\u201d she explains.\n\nHer first advice is to limit our media intake.\n\n\u201cPick one trusted source, someone reputable in nature, and check in once a day,\u201d she explains, emphasizing that being informed is important. \u201cBut then be unavailable to it for the rest of the day.\u201d\n\nThis is important because when we\u2019re already triggered, we\u2019re functioning from our sympathetic nervous system. We can\u2019t focus, we can\u2019t create. \u201cThis is why so many of us are so tired, so emotional right now. We are being flooded in neurochemicals. In order to re-wire your brain to succeed in certainty, we need to unplug from that,\u201d she says.\n\nNext, she suggests to make bold moves.\n\n\u201cRight now, we need to rise up in uncertain times more than we ever have. Now is the time to create the strongest vision you\u2019ve ever had. We can\u2019t control everything that\u2019s going on around us, but we need to control our vision, and how vibrant and multi-dimensional that is. I am encouraging my clients, students and the people in my community to rise up,\u201d she says.\n\nNext, it\u2019s time to pivot into leadership. Identify the things that need to start getting momentum. Is it going live on Instagram, updating a social media page, sending some emails? Just start taking action, she advises.\n\nWhat if this comes off as insensitive?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that dissuades people from taking action and leading during times of uncertainty is the fear that doing so will seem insensitive to the realities of our current predicament.\n\nHowever, there is a way to lead mindfully.\n\n\u201cIf we hold back and don\u2019t put the thing out in the world that has the potential to change someone\u2019s life, we are just being selfish,\u201d Dr. Irvine explains. \u201cLead with your service, lead with your generosity, lead with your service, you are the thing that people are leaning toward, they need you right now.\u201d\n\nChallenges show us who is a problem-solver, and who is a problem-exacerbator.\n\nIf you find yourself on the wrong side of that, this is a perfect time to start recalibrating the way you think.",

To support this movement, the young sea squirt develops one eye, a brain, and a spinal cord.\n\nAs the sea squirt matures, it undergoes a major transition.

We might be a little closer than you would imagine.\n\nDevelopmental biologists compared the genes of two seemingly different species: the skate (a type of fish) and the mouse. The biologists discovered that the two species share many genes related to movement. These shared genes determine their spinal cords, the placement of their limbs or fins, and the nearby muscles and nerves [3].",

The alliance between elements forms a compound.\n\nThis unique approach of carbon has attracted a strong and everlasting partnership with hydrogen and other elements. This includes nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous, and silicon. This prompted our scientists to start a new branch in chemistry. It is called organic chemistry.\n\nOrganic chemistry is the study of compounds that contains carbon. They are an indispensable part of the living world as they are the structural foundation of many compounds. This includes the backbones of life such as carbohydrates, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acids.\n\nAs technology evolved, organic compounds found new applications. Fossil fuels are derivatives of organic compounds. They are being used worldwide for energy production.\n\nMany human commodities are made of organic compounds. These include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, and plastic. Their ubiquitous nature in the products has prompted the contamination of water sources. Some of them are harmless and gets degraded easily. Others have serious health repercussions on the health of the living world [1].\n\nAfter the advent of ion-exchange membranes, scientists found ways to purify water. But, the removal of neutral species from water remained a problem [2]. Many organic compounds are neutral.\n\nThe process of reverse osmosis (RO) is the most advanced of ion-exchange technology today [2]. RO is capable of purifying even seawater which has the highest concentration of total solids among natural water sources [2]. But as organic compound concentrations in water sources increased, things became a little complicated.\n\nRO is costly. The increasing presence of organic contaminants was found to be hazardous to the RO membranes affecting their lifetime. Organochlorines are one of the most potent of the membrane destroyers [2]. It became imperative to remove organic compounds before the process of RO.\n\nRO process releases copious amounts of wastewater as RO concentrate. This water can be reused for domestic and industrial applications after treatment [2]. But the technology used for treatment should be cheap to make the venture sustainable and inexpensive.",

        "title": "2 Habits That Underrate Your Voice\u2019s Influence",
        "text": "Vocal Habit 1: Monotone\n\nModulation of the acoustic energy within the frequencies of the human voice that characterize music, similar to vocal prosody, will recruit and modulate the neural regulation of the middle ear muscles [auditory ossicles], functionally calm the behavioral and physiological state by increasing vagal regulation of the heart and promote more spontaneous social engagement behaviors\u2026basically we start to look and feel better when we listen to melodies. (Porges, S. 2011)\n\nIt\u2019s why a monotoned voice puts us to sleep and our ability to absorb, and perhaps retain, that information is comprised due to the shallow fundamental frequencies underlying a dull quality of voice.\n\nAs children, we can cry and speak infinitely, with nigh a break or touch of fatigue. We explore all manners of sounds, find delight in their whimsical impermanence, and wail on sirens that take our voice to the bottom of its range and swing it to its highest peaks. The colour, or prosody, of a child\u2019s voice, is a remarkable symphony. Along the line, the range of the voice gets narrower. An exciting speaker that innervates the inner ear muscles of the audience swoops and swirls his voice through the frequencies available to him, like a painting dancing with colour. So what restricts the colour of our voice?\n\nFirstly, in order to create prosody in the voice, your voice requires great finesse in the muscles controlling the vocal tract. Many of these vocal muscles required for prosody are innervated by the myelinated vagus nerve, and this nerve only fires efficiently when you are in a relaxed state. The reason behind this is that this nerve is governed under one of the autonomic nervous systems, the parasympathetic nervous system: the system responsible for regeneration and lowering the heart rate. When you are stressed, the sympathetic nervous system is dominant, and nerve efferents like the myelinated vagus nerve become less prominent and must battle to exert its influence over these vocal muscles.\n\nIts why, when nervous, we find it difficult to speak, or even to speak at all!\n\nIf a person finds themselves in a constant state of stress or tension like anxiety, your body begins to learn to use your voice in a different way through repetition. Bodily and neural resources are no longer required for empathetic human speech but rather the priming of muscles for movement or, its nemesis, freezing. Speech is stripped to its bare minimum, and prosody, an element required for social cohesion, is effectively switched off. The body does the opposite required for cohesion; it either wants to fight, freeze or run away, so newer neocortex activities like speaking with prosody, or active listening by triggering the tightening of the middle ear bones, are not required. If the anxiety persists, and the vocal folds remain unstretched, the mind-body learns to acquire this new muscle memory, and the range of the voice in normal conversation can remain lacking. Because the voice is key to expressing emotions we veer into the field of psychoneuroimmunology.\n\nPsychoneuroimmunology can be defined as the study of interactions between behavior, neural and endocrine function, and immune processes (Ader et al, 1995)\n\nThis is why understanding your emotional life is imperative to improving your voice. If you don\u2019t get aware of your shit it may prove difficult to become aware of how your voice changes and adapts to situations you may find yourself in, especially stressful ones, if you don\u2019t know what is triggering you to find it stressful in the first place.\n\nGet aware of your shit.\n\nVoice work is not easy, there is no quick fix, and you will have to develop a strong discipline to post-pone gratification; but like anything in life, anything worth doing is difficult. So, a monotoned voice can have its root in your emotional life; but it may also be maintained by poor breathing or posture. If you underpower your voice, the vocal folds have to maintain a thickness that limits the range of your frequencies at your disposal. It\u2019s why a monotoned voice is typically quite deep. An underpowered voice means there is a lack of breath to support the voice, you may get the words out phonetically, but the ideas and emotional life of what you are saying, which live in the variances of the range of the voice, are non-existent.\n\nFirstly, to reintroduce the potential for dynamic range in your voice focus your attention on the vowels in the word. Each vowel is a formant with a different set of frequencies in the voice; this means there is naturally occurring modulation in the vowels you speak. Over enunciating the vowels as a practice in your free time, such as reading from a book out loud, can help you get a sense of their potential in your common tongue. You\u2019ll find that the sensation lingers having completed the exercise.\n\nSecondly, singing is a must if your voice lacks dynamism. There is a colossal amount of research on the benefits of singing on your physical health, such as governing the release of a newly discovered chemical called endocannabinoids, which does exactly what you think it does, but it also helps stretch your vocal folds and activate articulators that may have become dormant. It forces you to kickstart your respiratory muscles to function cohesively with voicing, meaning, you learn how to give enough air to your voice so the tone and quality are not underpowered. But it needs to be practiced so might I suggest the shower! This leads us to our next rule.\n\nVocal Habit 2: Underpowering\n\nThis is exactly how it sounds; a self-defeating habit that really sucks as it pulls your legs out from under you! This commonly occurs when you have something important to say, and that\u2019s the crux; because it\u2019s important, it carries more weight, and if you don\u2019t step up to bear it upon your shoulders, the words can implode before the idea has even left your mouth. It takes courage to speak your worth because once it's passed your lips, you cannot take it back; however, underpowering tries to do just that, \u201cone foot out of the door and one foot in\u201d.\n\nYou have to commit whole heartedly. There\u2019s no sitting on the fence when you are required to speak on matters that are important to you!\n\nUnderpowering means that not enough breath is being capitalised to give enough tone, amplitude, and resonant quality to the voice so that it can either sound muffled, monotone, non-audible, or thin (lacking in harmonics that capture the inner-ear to regulate neural functions that engage social cohesion). Here are two ways it can happen: the first is that the tongue slightly stiffens up and retracts back into the throat, physically stemming the tide of sound from escaping, or \u201cswallowing your words\u201d as it is known. It may sound like lunacy that you\u2019re trying to do one thing but your body is doing another but this is the role, or a specimen, of cognitive dissonance. Another key example of underpowering is when your voice fails to make it to the end of your sentence. If you consistently fall off the end of your sentence, where coincidentally the crux of the idea lives, this should concern you as it detracts from the power of your idea.\n\nThe second is a locking of the respiratory muscles. We do this when anxious to protect the body. Without going into the phylogenetic heritage of our nervous system, which you can do here, our response to stress developed to protect us from predators, so the tensing or priming of muscles was key to our survival. The most common is the constricting of the core muscles (rectus abdominis, transversus abominis, etc). A locked belly, however, does not allow for thoracic capacity to increase to efficiently intake enough air for what you may want to say, due to your core muscles being an integral part of sustaining phonation. Energy, that should be directed to controlling airflow, is instead directed to protecting the body from an ancient enemy.\n\nUnderstanding how your body reacts to stress is integral to transforming the ancient neural vestiges we maintain, such as the fight-flight response to stress, into something that you can use to your adavantage.\n\nThe key is in the concept of \u201cno effort\u201d. Restricting primary muscles, especially those used for respiration, has an enormous impact on the use of your voice because you tend to recruit secondary respiratory muscles to pick up the slack. These muscles, such as the sternocleidomastoid, are not meant for the fine control of vocalisation and can introduce tension within the vocal tract due to their proximity. To read more about the effects of breathing on the voice may I suggest you begin with, What Crocodiles and Humans Have in Common. If you tend to find that a locked belly is common for you, you may have to begin a process of exercises that enhance your proprioception, so that you can begin to let go of excessive, and unnecessary tension, in response to stress. Relaxing and releasing specific muscles can teach you the essence of \u201cno effort\u201d because it teaches you to understand, via proprioception, what muscles are required, and muscles that aren\u2019t. Like learning the guitar, where every muscle is involved, you have to learn to use only what is necessary and if it means learning how to breathe effectively again, like an infant, then so be it, there is no shame in learning.\n\nYour body is trying to protect you from the tiger lurking behind the reeds, be patient.\n\nWhat Happens Now\n\nPractice. Record yourself and listen to yourself free of negative judgment but with honest critique and appraisal. If you find your voice lacks pitch and resonating variance, trying incorporating your body into the language. Jumping up or down, sitting and standing up, or running on the spot, will help to ignite, or rather, give you the gift of realizing your potential for colour within your voice. Become aware of the vowels within your speech, and try singing; you\u2019ve nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nGet aware of your shit. You must take responsibility for how your body deals with stress, not just for the sake of your voice but for your own self-understanding. Because it is such a primal and visceral biological function it is paramount to understand what patterns you\u2019ve developed to cope with it and with that knowledge you may begin to unpack the myriad of ways that it affects your voice. How Stress Affects Your Voice, is another good starting point for those seeking more information.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to respond below.",

        "title": "Food Cravings: Microscopic Puppetmasters Might Be Involved",
        "text": "Food Cravings: Microscopic Puppetmasters Might Be Involved\n\n5 arguments that gut microbes can manipulate food choices.\n\nImage by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay\n\nResisting food cravings can be a nightmare for some and a struggle for many. While the cause of food cravings itself is multifaceted \u2014 encompassing environmental, cultural, social, psychological, genetic, and behavioural (habits) factors \u2014 scientists have pondered on the microbial aspects as well.\n\nGiven that the gut-brain axis is well established in modern biology, it\u2019s quite imaginable for gut microbes to induce cravings in the brain. As Professor Carlo Maley, director of the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center and the first president of the International Society for Evolution, Ecology and Cancer, wrote as a senior co-author in BioAssays:\n\n\u201cGut microbes may manipulate host eating behaviour in ways that promote their fitness at the expense of host fitness.\u201d\n\nThis idea first stems from a classic example that a microbe can directly manipulate host behaviour. The parasite Toxoplasma gondii enters the rodent\u2019s brain, making it lost its sense of fear for cat\u2019s urine. Instead, infected rodents became attracted to cat\u2019s urine \u2014 \u201ca propensity that promotes the transmission of T. gondii at the expense of the fitness of the rat,\u201d they said.\n\nThe same may apply to food cravings \u2014 that those gut microbes somehow convince the host at the subconscious level to prefer foods that contain specific nutrients that favour their growth. Gut microbes that love chocolates or sweets, for example, might motivate the host to eat them more often.\n\n\u201cLike microscopic puppetmasters, microbes may control the eating behavior of hosts\u2026,\u201d they reckoned.\n\nTo support their scientific viewpoint, Professor Maley and colleagues articulated 5 compelling evidence.\n\n1. Taste Receptors\n\nGerm-free mice are bred in a sterile environment and, hence, they lack proper gut microbiota. Germ-free mice are one of the best research tools to understand the impact of gut microbiota on the host physiology.\n\nStudies have shown that germ-mice have an increased preference for fatty and sugary foods than normal mice with gut microbiota. And the germ-free mice have higher expression of receptors for fat and sugar in their mouth and intestines. This suggests that low gut microbial diversity, as reflected in germ-free mice, encourages food preferences for fats and sugars.\n\n2. The Vagal Tone\n\nIn 2008, researchers at Mayo Clinic, Minnesota have successfully applied vagal blockage (vBloc) therapy to treat obesity. Participants consumed 30% fewer calories as a result of quicker satiation and reduced hunger.\n\nThe similar weight loss outcomes were replicated in 2016 and in 2017, with the latter study concluding that \u201cvBloc therapy continues to result in medically meaningful weight loss with a favourable safety profile through 2 years.\u201dThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has, in fact, already approved vBloc therapy for treating obesity in 2015.\n\nThe vagus nerve is the main driver of the body\u2019s rest-and-digest activities. It makes sense that an overactive vagus nerve would lead to excessive digestive activities and resulting hunger. Stimulating the vagus nerve with noradrenaline in mice made them desire more food despite already eating beyond the point of satiation; this did not occur if the vagus nerve was cut.\n\nSome gut microbes such as Bacillus and Escherichia species secrete noradrenaline. \u201cGut microbes that produce adrenergic neurochemicals may [therefore] contribute to overeating via mechanisms involving vagal nerve activity,\u201d Professor Maley and his team wrote.\n\n3. Appetite-Regulating Hormones\n\nLower levels of satiety hormones (e.g., leptin and cholecystokinin) have been found in germ-free mice. Feeding mice with Lactobacillus probiotics, in turn, inhibited the release of hunger hormones (e.g., agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y) in the brain.\n\nCertain gut bacteria can synthesize peptides that bear structural similarities to human appetite-regulating peptide hormones such as ghrelin and leptin. The structure of a protein is the chief determinant of which receptor(s) it binds to and consequently what effect(s) it exerts. Thus, these microbial peptides are \u2018mimics\u2019 to host\u2019s appetite-regulating peptide hormones, in terms of structure and function.\n\nThese microbial peptide mimics, however, are usually silenced by host enzymes \u2014 \u201ca phenomenon that could have evolved as a mammalian counter-adaptation to microbial manipulation,\u201d Professor Maley et al. said in a statement. But in case they were not silenced completely, \u201cmicrobial manipulation\u201d may be in effect.\n\n4. Toxins\n\nUnder conditions of nutrients imbalances, microbial communities normally at low levels might bloom. Excessive iron bioavailability in the gut, for instance, increases the populations of pathogenic Salmonella and Candida species that can release toxins and injure the gut.\n\nThe resulting gut inflammation could induce a negative mood, leading to emotional eating, the researchers hypothesize. Otherwise, the gut bacterial toxins might also trigger the avoidance of specific foods via the activation of pain receptors present in the gut.\n\n5. Dietary Preferences\n\n\u201cPrevotella grows best on carbohydrates; dietary fibre provides a competitive advantage to Bifidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes has a substrate preference for certain fats,\u201d Professor Maley et al. explained. Whereas Roseburia species thrive with polysaccharides or complex carbohydrates. Japanese natives have evolved a gut bacterium called Bacteroides plebeius that digests seaweed.\n\nThese show that gut microbes have food preferences too. It won\u2019t be a surprise if they have evolved mechanisms to improve their fitness (i.e., growth) by influencing the host dietary choices, for example.\n\n\u201cModern biology suggests that our bodies are composed of a diversity of organisms competing for nutritional resources,\u201d the researchers wrote. Evolutionary competition between the host vs. gut microbes fitness may lead to \u201ccognitive conflict\u201d in food choices \u2014 i.e., food cravings.\n\n\u201cExerting self-control over eating choices may be partly a matter of suppressing microbial signals that originate in the gut,\u201d Professor Maley and colleagues conclude. \u201cAcquired tastes may [therefore] be due to the acquisition of microbes that benefit from those foods.\u201d",

        "title": "How Antibiotics Could Alter the Child\u2019s Mind and Body Development",
        "text": "How Antibiotics Could Alter the Child\u2019s Mind and Body Development\n\nThe lesser-known health risks of antibiotics in children.\n\nImage by rawpixel.com\n\nAlthough antibiotics use has decreased overall since the early 2000s, it is not the case for respiratory diseases. In the US, it is estimated that antibiotics were prescribed to one-fifth of children\u2019s medical visits, of which 50% were broad-spectrum (usually macrolide), and over 70% were for respiratory diseases.\n\nAntibiotics only kill bacteria, not viruses. Yet both bacteria and viruses can cause respiratory illness. So, about 29% of antibiotics given for respiratory disease in children are unnecessary, which comprises over 10 million visits per year in the US. \u201cBroad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory paediatrics is extremely common and frequently inappropriate,\u201d said a 2011 national study in the US. In 2016, the CDC reports that one in three antibiotics were given needlessly.\n\nUnnecessary antibiotics are not only improper in the context of superbugs pandemics but come with health risks as well, especially in children. The gut microbiota is undergoing rapid changes in infancy and childhood. Antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum ones, tend to wipe out beneficial gut microbes. Not to mention that children\u2019s brain and physique are also experiencing sensitive growth phases.\n\nAntibiotics and Weight Gain\n\nIn a 2019 study of 586 children, 33.79% received 1\u20132 courses, and 5.63% received >3 courses of antibiotics within the first year of life. When these children turned six years old, those that took antibiotics had a dose-dependent increase in both excess weight and risk of future obesity. Results remained significant after adjusting for maternal age, BMI, race, marital status, income, education, smoking, diabetes, and breastfeeding. Statistically speaking, children that took 1\u20132 and >3 courses of antibiotics had a 0.17 and 0.42 increase in BMI z-score, respectively.\n\n(The WHO classifies BMI z-score of < \u22122.0, > 1.0, > 2.0, and > 3.0 as wasted, at-risk-for-overweight, overweight, and obese, respectively, in children of 0\u20135 years old. Scientists use this BMI z-score method to standardized weight in light of the child\u2019s increasing height.)\n\nWeight gain is particularly prominent with broad-spectrum antibiotics like cephalosporins and macrolides. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, in contrast, had little-to-no impact on weight gain unless taken for 5\u20137 courses.\n\nIn a 2015 Finland study of 12,062 children under two years old, those exposed to 2\u20133 and >4 courses of antibiotics had a 0.10 and 0.18 higher BMI z-score, respectively, than those never exposed. And this number is 0.23 and 0.28 \u2014 indicating overweight to near obesity \u2014 in girls and boys, respectively, under six months old that took macrolide, a common broad-spectrum antibiotic.\n\nOther massive cohort studies in the US \u2014 in 2014 (65,480 children), 2015 (163,820 children), and 2017 (8,793 children) \u2014 all found a dose-response effect of antibiotics on weight gain. All results were also adjusted for possible confounding factors. The weight gain is particularly prominent with broad-spectrum antibiotics like cephalosporins and macrolides. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, in contrast, had little-to-no impact on weight gain unless taken for 5\u20137 courses.\n\nBoys appear to be more susceptible to weight gain from antibiotics than girls.\n\nAs the Finland study and other research have noticed, boys appear to be more susceptible to weight gain from antibiotics than girls.\n\nA Canadian study in 2014 of 616 children reported that antibiotics exposure in the first year of life presented a five-fold increased odds of being overweight at 12 years old in boys but not girls.\n\nIn another 2014 study involving 74,946 children from 18 countries, early antibiotics exposure was an independent risk factor for future weight gain in boys only.\n\nEven in chickens and older adults, males tended to gain more weight from antibiotics exposure compared to females.\n\nWhile reasons are still uncertain, scientists of the 2014 multinational study speculated that: \u201cOur finding of the BMI-promoting effects of antibiotics being confined to boys might be explained by sex-specific differences in intestinal adaptation to early-life antibiotic exposure or to how antibiotic drugs are metabolised.\u201d\n\nAntibiotics and Neurodevelopment\n\nIn was first shown in a 2017 study that early life antibiotics exposure may pose unfavourable neurodevelopment consequences. In New Zealand, researchers followed 871 children from birth. They learned that those with antibiotics use within the first year of life had an elevated risk of behavioural issues and symptoms of depression and ADHD at 3.5 and 11 years of age. These did not happen in children that never took or took antibiotics after age one.\n\nThe earlier the antibiotics intake, the worse the neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nLater in a 2019 study, the same research team in New Zealand sought to see if their 2017 results could be replicated with another cohort of 473 children. After adjusting for confounders, children that took antibiotics within the first two years of life had lower IQ and verbal comprehension at 11 years old. The earlier the antibiotics intake, the worse the neurodevelopmental outcomes as well. Children under six months old that took antibiotics had more problems with cognition, impulsivity, working memory, ADHD, and anxiety at 11 years old than children unexposed or exposed to antibiotics at later ages.\n\nLastly, a nationwide Finland study in 2019 tracked 990,098 births over time. Antibiotics exposure, especially broad-spectrum ones, within the first two years of life lead to a 12\u201353% increased risk of \u201cchildhood development of sleep disorders, ADHD, conduct disorder, mood and anxiety disorders, and other behavioural and emotional disorders,\u201d the academics concluded. \u201cGiven the high occurrence of early-life antibiotic exposure, and the substantial prevalence of childhood- and adolescent-onset psychopathology, modest associations among these phenomena are of public health relevance.\u201d\n\nInfant gut microbiota disturbance might underlie the detrimental effects of antibiotics on neurodevelopment.\n\nWhile these studies did not analyse the gut microbiota, they posited that infant gut microbiota disturbance might underlie the detrimental effects of antibiotics on neurodevelopment. One research in 2018 has shown, for the first time, that infant gut microbiota profile was associated with future cognitive outcomes in children.\n\nMore robust evidence of causation can be derived from animal experimentations. Studies in 2016 and 2020 by two independent research groups presented strikingly similar results: Antibiotics disrupted the gut microbiota and memory of mice, which was followed by abnormalities in brain biochemistry related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and socioemotional neuropeptide systems.\n\nShort Abstract\n\nOne in three antibiotic prescriptions (including in children) is not justified. Not only they hasten superbugs pandemics but pose health consequences too. Antibiotics exposure in early life (1\u20132 years old) is an independent risk factor for future weight gain and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, probably as a result of gut microbiota disruption. These effects are stronger with broad-spectrum antibiotics. And boys appeared to be more susceptible than girls to antibiotics-induced weight gain. So, it is best to avoid antibiotics when it is not mandatory. Lastly, an article in JAMA Pediatrics by Professor Megan Moreno, MD, is useful in helping a parent decide \u201cWhen Your Child Does Not Need Antibiotics.\u201d\n\nSource: JAMA Pediatrics Patient Page, 2013. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3274\n\nThis article is inspired by Mad Mockingbird.",

        "title": "2019: a lightly bamboozled review of the year in neuroscience",
        "text": "1. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about being human?\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s Jose Mourinho. If I had to explain, it wouldn\u2019t be funny.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about the human brain? A question broad and deep, one that has obsessed thinkers since Antiquity. Our once god-like status, apart and above from all animals, now steadily eroded by science, from natural selection placing us as but one species evolved from and in parallel to many others, to genetics putting the boot in by showing that we share 90 percent of our DNA with cats. Including my cat Bob, and he constantly falls off the back of the sofa.\n\nYou\u2019d have thought neuroscience would have been all over the question of what\u2019s special about the human brain, what with it being the study of the brain and all. But what we could do has been very limited. Largely we have only been able to observe behaviour, stuff we can do that other species cannot: talking endlessly in complex grammars, voting for bell-ends, that sort of thing. And supplement these observations with crude measures of the brain\u2019s structure \u2014 how many neurons it has, which bits are thicker or larger than others, which bits are folded \u2014 compare them to other species, and going \u201cooo look it\u2019s different\u201d.\n\nBut to understand why the human brain is \u201cspecial\u201d we need some kind of theory as to why any of those crude brain differences would make any contribution to that specialness. For a start, to know what\u2019s different about the neurons themselves: what\u2019s different about the types of neurons that exist, or the signals they send, or both. Which is the preserve of us \u201csystems\u201d neuroscientists. Yet systems neuroscience hasn\u2019t had much to say about this question, because of the deep problems of measuring neurons in humans. Until, that is, this year.\n\nA. Special codes\n\nIn a brave paper, Pryluk and colleagues attempted a direct comparison of how the code used by neurons differed between humans and monkeys. They took long recordings of single neurons from the amygdala and cingulate cortex of monkeys. And compared them to similar recordings from the same regions in humans. These human recordings are ultra-rare: they came from patients with epilepsy that was both so serious and so unresponsive to drugs that they were being prepped for surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures \u2014 and to find that part, they had electrodes implanted for a week or more. And while these electrodes were in there, and while laying in their hospital bed, the patients graciously agreed to do a series of tasks for the experimenters.\n\nWith these precious data to hand, Pryluk and friends asked a straightforward question: how much information are these neurons sending? In practice, this was a tough question to ask, as there are all sorts of things to compensate for, like correcting for differing firing rates across neurons and between species. But if we believe their measurement of how much information a neuron sends, their end result is clear. Human neurons in both the amygdala and cingulate cortex send more information \u2014 in that they are closer to the maximum possible rate of information sending \u2014 and do so more efficiently : they send fewer spikes for the same amount of information. Which means? Who knows. But their results point to human cortex having an increased capacity, so that much more information can be represented across a population of neurons, but at the cost of less robust coding \u2014 if fewer spikes are used, so the message being transmitted is more sensitive to failure and noise. And as know, the human brain is very sensitive to failure.\n\nB. Special neurons?\n\nWhile the Pryluk paper hinted at something special about how the human cortex encodes information, it didn\u2019t tell us anything about whether this is because the types of neurons are special to humans. We get much of our deep understanding of types of neurons from mice, thanks to their being the workhorse of genetics (a good thing that the actual workhorse is not the workhorse of genetics, otherwise Janelia Farm would be, literally, a farm. And about 10000 square miles in size). Hence \u201cwhat\u2019s so special about the human brain?\u201d translates in genetics to: how do we differ from mice?\n\nA Nature paper from the Allen Brain Institute tackled this question head-on by directly comparing the gene expression between the cortex of the human and mouse. To do that, they first had to solve the small problem of accurately sequencing the RNA-expression of single neurons in the human cortex. Having cracked that, they then grouped all their neurons into types according to the similarity of their expressed genes. The result? 69 different types of neurons in the human cortex, of which 24 are excitatory (as in, they expressed glutamate) and 45 are inhibitory.\n\nSo which of these 69 types of neuron are unique, are responsible for endowing we humans with our special brain thinking stuff? None. All 69 are also closely matched in the mouse cortex. The major difference is not the type of neuron, but where they are found. In mice, all 24 types of excitatory cell stick to one particular layer of the cortex. In humans, many of those same excitatory types appear in more than one layer of the cortex. And why would this make the human cortex special? Who knows.\n\nYet their results are strong confirmation of what we all know: evolution is a tinkerer. We may have diverged from rodents about 90 million years ago, but in something as complex as the mammalian brain, in which genes define merely an outline of the details of the adult brain, big changes will almost always be catastrophic. So the main difference between the neurons in the mouse and human cortex is not in the proliferation of brand new types of neurons, but in the repurposing of what is already to hand. Oh, and the fact that mice have about 10 millions neurons in their cortex, and we have about 17 billion.\n\nC. Dendrites predict intelligence?\n\nWe like to think humans are the most intelligent species on the planet, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. A provocative paper at the very end of 2018 asked what it is about our neurons that makes us intelligent. And the answer is: the more complex the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in our cortex, the higher our IQ. Wow!\n\nWell, maybe. Such unusual claims deserve close scrutiny. After all, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. As we have no theory which predicts that more complex dendrites have anything to do with intelligence, so we need some pretty compelling evidence to believe this is not just happenstance correlation. The researchers obtained another rare sample of human cortical neurons: in this case, from bits of the temporal lobe removed during brain surgery, placed on ice, then popped into the experimental set-up as soon as practically possible while the neurons still lived. They took a range of measurements from the neurons. Each patient took an IQ test. And the researchers correlated some of the measurements with the IQ scores. Why these measurements? No reasons given \u2014 so already alarm bells are sounding about what other measurements were correlated with IQ, found to be lacking, and omitted from the paper.\n\nIs the evidence compelling? No. The key evidence is the correlation between the total length of the dendrites and the IQ of the patient. Namely, this figure:\n\nFrom Goriounova et al (2018). Each symbol is the average over the neurons in one subject; error bars are one standard deviation. The correlation (r value), regression (black line), and confidence interval of regression (blue shading) all appear to be taken from the symbols \u2014 i.e. the average scores.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that this is the best correlation they have, and it is still weak (explaining 26% of the variance), take a closer look. Each data-point is a patient, so the value for the length of the dendrites is an average over the measured neurons in that patient. Now you don\u2019t have to be a neuroanatomy geek to know that pyramidal neurons come in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, so averaging over them is a bit\u2026. Well, charitably we\u2019d call it weird. More bluntly, meaningless. And I\u2019ve just told you that human cortex contains about 24 types of excitatory neuron, and most of those are some kind of pyramidal neuron. This correlation contains just 72 pyramidal neurons in total. So it hideously undersamples the diversity of pyramidal neuron dendrites in human cortex.\n\nWorse, the above figure and others in the paper are textbook examples of how not to compute a correlation. The correlations are computed using averages \u2014 without taking into account how wrong those averages might be. And they could be so wrong that the correlation disappears completely. Indeed, looking at the range of data variation (the error bars) in the above figure, I\u2019d wager the correlation would indeed disappear if tested properly (more on this in the Appendix below).\n\nFinally, a simple thought experiment. These neurons happen to come from the temporal lobe of the cortex, a region plausibly involved in some kind of \u201cthinking\u201d that might contribute to an IQ score. But that was just because these patients had epilepsy, and the temporal lobe usually contains the region that starts epileptic brain activity. But what if these samples had been from primary visual cortex (V1)? They\u2019d find the same diversity of sizes of pyramidal neuron dendrites, because types of pyramidal neuron are largely consistent across the cortex. But if they\u2019d reported a correlation between the size of dendrites in V1 and a person\u2019s IQ score, who would have taken them seriously?",

        "title": "Your Thoughts Are Not Original",
        "text": "Whenever I have a self-proclaimed epiphany about what topic to write about next, it\u2019s usually short-lived.\n\nMore often than not, I will encounter articles that cover similar, if not the exact, same topic or spread the same message. To make matters worse, the pieces are far more eloquently written and contain much better examples and quotes.\n\nAs an aspiring writer, it\u2019s a little disheartening and demotivating. After all, writing interesting articles is a competitive landscape as it is. Why would a reader choose your piece over a much more accomplished author?\n\nThis thought process is a battle against yourself more than anything else. And the more time you spend fussing about it, the higher the likelihood you will find a reason not to publish or bail on an idea.\n\nTo stop doubting the value or quality of your piece, it\u2019s worth exploring where this feeling originates. I\u2019ve come across a few concepts that explain the psychological process that could cause this doubt, namely the Frequency Illusion and Collective Consciousness.\n\nFrequency Illusion\n\nAs the premise of this article suggests, this concept has already been studied at length and has been coined the Frequency Illusion by Stanford linguistics professor Arnold Zwicky and is more commonly known as the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.\n\nThe Frequency Illusion is a result of two well-known psychological processes, selective attention (noticing things that are salient to us, disregarding the rest) and confirmation bias (looking for things that support our hypotheses, disregarding potential counterevidence)\n\nAs I\u2019m not too familiar with psychological processes, the quote above didn\u2019t tell me that much. So I dug a little deeper into the components that comprise the frequency illusion.\n\nPhoto by Ricardo Gomez Angel on Unsplash\n\nSelective Attention\n\nAttention refers to how we actively process information in our environment. It\u2019s not only about applying focus on a specific task but also involves ignoring other information and stimuli.\n\nAttention is a limited resource; therefore, we have to be selective about what to focus on.\n\nThis explains how we sometimes miss other things that are right in front of us. It wasn\u2019t relevant enough at the time.\n\nThe other way around it explains how we suddenly see the same type of vehicle appear everywhere when we\u2019ve just taken a test drive, or that more women seem to be pregnant now that you\u2019ve been thinking about starting a family. In that sense, it highlights those events that are on top of your mind.\n\nConfirmation bias\n\nThe second component is what is called Confirmation Bias. This concept influences how we interpret and recall information. We are more inclined to gather evidence that supports and emphasizes our beliefs and to dismiss or fail to seek contradictory evidence.\n\nNow confirmation bias is in itself an interesting to dive into as it plays a role in a variety of highly debated topics ranging from scientific studies to politics, finance, health, religion, etc.\n\nFor the sake of this article, I will refrain from elaborating too much and revert to the scope. The point is that as you are writing about a particular topic, you will be more inclined to emphasize aspects that are aligned with the point you\u2019re trying to make.\n\nCollective Consciousness\n\nApart from the Frequency Illusion, originality is further influenced by what is called Collective Consciousness. This concept, developed by the French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim refers to the common set of beliefs, ideas, attitudes, and knowledge within a group or society.\n\nDurkheim concluded that society exists because unique individuals feel a sense of solidarity with each other. The collective consciousness informs our sense of belonging, identity, and behavior.\n\nWithin a group, people are bound to come up with similar thought processes as it reaffirms their sense of belonging. That is why you will find a lot of agreeable opinions, open doors, and repetition to stay in line with the homogeneous character of the group.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point?\n\nIf it\u2019s all been thought out before and we\u2019re so biased based on our attention span and our position in society, why bother stressing about originality?\n\nWell, you probably shouldn\u2019t. Even though an idea is far more likely to have been thought out before deriving your own opinions and conclusions from, it is a worthwhile exercise. That\u2019s the part where you gain understanding and learn about how to apply the learnings to benefit yourself and others.\n\nTo paraphrase what the author Mark Manson wrote in his most recent book \u201cEverything is f*cked\u201d and that I find particularly applicable here is:\n\n\u201cValues cannot be changed with reason, only through experience\u201d\n\nPiling on more information will not aid in standing out; sharing your experiences is the added value. Knowledge in itself is useless if you don\u2019t know how to apply it.",

He was overwhelmed with sadness that \u201cwe didn\u2019t understand \u2014 not Hitler, nor the Germans, nor Stalin, nor the communists. We didn\u2019t understand any of them.\u201d\n\nAnd this man believed this lack of understanding was holding back progress.\n\n\u201cIt was at that moment that I realized that the rest of my life must be devoted to discovering a psychology for the peace table. That moment changed my whole life.\u201d\n\nThis was the drive behind Abraham Maslow\u2019s famous hierarchy of needs, as told by Hoffman in The right to be human: A biography of Abraham Maslow (1999, 2nd edition).\n\nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs was first introduced in his 1943 paper \u201cA Theory of Human Motivation\u201d in Psychological Review. It has been used widely in many different fields, particularly in management, to understand human motivation and happiness.\n\nWhat made Maslow\u2019s studies different from other psychologists during his time was his focus on happiness and health \u2014 rather than human weakness. He believed when basic needs are met, the deeper desires of creativity and fulfilling our potential can be addressed.\n\nHow is this helpful when writing content \u2014 and headlines? Firstly, we can better capture our reader\u2019s attention with content that addresses their deep needs. Secondly, when we believe our reader is capable of achieving their best self, we help our readers believe that too.\n\nToday we\u2019ll look at Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs and learn how we can bond more deeply with our readers by fulfilling one or more of these needs in our content and headline writing.",

As a web- and mobile developer with over 16 years of experience on his belt, I\u2019ve learned what needs consideration before you start your mobile adventure, both for business supporting apps and stand-alone mobile app services.\n\nEvery assumption that you\u2019re starting your mobile app product on is false until proven valid\n\nYour Assumptions Are Wrong\n\nIn an era where building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), and pivoting ideas as taught by The Lean Startup and agile processes are king, assuming you just need to build your mobile app and turning it into a success is proven to have a 99% chance of failing.\n\nEvery assumption that you\u2019re starting your mobile app product on is false until proven valid. This is a law that applies universally.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re always in the wrong ball-park. But it is unlikely that you are spot on in one stroke, and you should always assume that you are working on wrong assumptions.\n\nYour assumptions could be a little off and just need a little tweaking to work for your idea, or they can be wrong entirely.\n\nAs an entrepreneur or maker, it is your job to find out what assumptions are right and wrong, and how to improve them or find the right ones for your product.\n\nHere are some ways that can help you to minimize the error in your assumptions:\n\nScratch your itch: work on an idea for a solution that you need for yourself or to solve a problem that you\u2019re experiencing yourself. That way, you can validate if it works for you. You\u2019ll need to find out if there are enough of other people that have the same problem to see if this is going to be viable\n\nIdea pivoting: create the simplest form of your idea that helps you to demonstrate your solution to others. This could be as simple as creating an Excel sheet, a clickable wireframe, mockups, or non-coding examples.

        "title": "How To Make Your Writing More Engaging",
        "text": "A few months ago, I wrote a review of award-winning editor Jack Hart\u2019s book Storycraft: The Complete Guide to Writing Narrative Nonfiction.\n\n(That\u2019s my Amazon affiliate link above \u2014 I\u2019ll make a small comission if you buy a copy at no extra cost to you. Thanks!)\n\nStorycraft is one of my favorite books on the craft of writing (I share several of my other favorite books in my article here). Even though Hart aimed his book at writers of nonfiction, I believe there is much that writers of fiction can glean from its pages too.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s one chapter in particular that\u2019s a goldmine of editing tips for any kind of writing. Recently, I collected my top takeaways from the chapter and arranged them as an editing checklist for myself when I work on blog posts, essays, and short stories.\n\nI\u2019ve found these tips incredibly helpful so, today, I wanted to share seven of them with you!\n\nThese powerful editing tips will help you breathe life into your writing, turn plodding sentences and paragraphs into fast-paced narratives, and capture the attention of your readers.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n1. Get Moving in Your Introduction\n\nHart emphasizes the importance of getting moving right out of the block. Make sure your opening paragraphs aren\u2019t dry and filled with exposition. Instead, they should include a sentence or two that catches your reader\u2019s interest and entices them to read more.\n\nHook your readers with action, curiosity, or intrigue.\n\nThe hook might be the very first sentence in your piece \u2014 a real attention grabber like the opening line of George Orwell\u2019s 1984,\n\n\u201cIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\u201d\n\nIn my recent memoir essay \u201cExpecting the Unexpected in New York City\u201d, I followed that approach, opening with this sentence,\n\n\u201cDuring the two-and-a-half years that I went to college in New York City, I witnessed a crime only once.\u201d\n\nHowever, you can also bury the hook several paragraphs into your piece as I did in my essay \u201cThe Hidden Treasure Beneath My Library\u201d, and as Joan Didion did in her essay \u201cSome Dreamers of the Golden Dream\u201d when she writes, after three paragraphs,\n\n\u201cImagine Banyan Street first, because Banyan is where it happened.\u201d\n\nEven if the hook appears several paragraphs into your story or essay, make sure those preceding paragraphs are fast moving. They might even hint that a twist or something else unexpected is coming.\n\nAnd that leads into tip #2.\n\n2. Push Scenes Forward with Continuous Motion\n\nScenes should not be stagnant. At the end of a scene, the action should move forward. The characters shouldn\u2019t be glued to their chairs and talking to each other like robots. That will bore our readers to tears!\n\nIf you have scenes with dialogue, include descriptions of what the characters are doing while they\u2019re talking. Often, this is more effective at revealing what they\u2019re feeling then if you used words like \u201cangrily.\u201d\n\nFor example, compare these two sentences:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this,\u201d he said and slammed the door behind him.\n\nWhen you\u2019re editing your piece, look to see if you\u2019ve included motion to push scenes forward. If you\u2019re writing an informative blog post, this might mean including a story to illustrate a point.\n\n3. Use the Language of Action\n\nAre your action scenes as powerful as they could be?\n\nHart points out that the most powerful action words describe causality.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re describing a woman driving a car. She tries to swerve out of the way of something in the road. You could write, \u201cThe car jerked to the left.\u201d\n\nBut Hart suggests that it would be more gripping to write, \u201cShe jerked the wheel to the left\u201d. It puts us closer to where the action is happening.\n\n4. Write in the Active Voice\n\nWith tip #3 in mind, when you edit your piece, make sure you\u2019ve written your sentences in the active voice and not the passive.\n\nIf your high school grammar is a little rusty, you can read a quick review of passive sentences here. Essentially, in a passive sentence, the subject receives the action rather than performing it.\n\nFor example, politicians and business executives like to use the passive voice when they want to avoid claiming responsibility for a mistake. They might write, \u201cMistakes were made.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a neat little trick because this sentence avoids taking responsibility by failing to tell us who made the mistakes.\n\nNote that you can\u2019t fix a passive sentence by tacking the subject onto the end. \u201cMistakes were made by all of us\u201d is still passive.\n\nSo how to fix it?\n\nJust write, \u201cWe all made mistakes.\u201d Now the sentence is active.\n\n5. Eliminate Unnecessary Words\n\nIn his book On Writing Well, William Zinsser notes,\n\n\u2026The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that\u2019s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what\u2013these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.\n\nHart agrees and recommends eliminating the following unnecessary words in order to write strong sentences:\n\n1. Progressive tense and auxiliary verbs. Write \u201cThe wind blows\u201d or \u201cThe wind blew\u201d instead of \u201cthe wind is blowing\u201d or \u201cthe wind had blown.\u201d\n\n2. Empty Words. For example, eliminate \u201cThere are\u201d, \u201cThere is\u201d, \u201cThere was\u201d, \u201cIt is\u201d, \u201cIt was\u201d. I shared more about empty words in my article here.\n\n3. Beginning of an action. For example, don\u2019t say \u201cHe began to race around the room.\u201d Just write, \u201cHe raced around the room.\u201d\n\n6. Use Time Markers and Straight Chronology\n\nSometimes when you\u2019re writing a narrative, it\u2019s necessary to skip forward or backward in time. However, if you do, be sure you use clear time markers so your readers don\u2019t get confused.\n\nIf your reader has to stop to try to figure out when something is happening, it will definitely slow down the pace of your narrative.\n\nA time marker just means that you write a line explaining when the next scene is going to take place. For example, \u201cNone of this would have happened if I hadn\u2019t received that call two days earlier\u2026\u201d or \u201cFast forward three weeks later.\u201d\n\nHart points out that sometimes your time markers can be more subtle,\n\n\u201cYou might simply note the fall colors on the trees when you open a new scene that jumps ahead from summer to autumn. Or you could slip in the height of the sun in the sky when a character walks out of a building.\u201d\n\nHe also believes straight chronology is the easiest for readers to follow, so evaluate your piece to see if a flashback really is necessary. Sometimes I\u2019ll rearrange paragraphs in my piece because I realize that jumping backward and then forward in time might be confusing to my readers.\n\n7. Speed up, then Slow Down\n\nSpeed up during the boring parts. Slow down during the climatic scenes.\n\nHow do you speed up? Wherever you have lots of exposition, make sure you\u2019re only communicating what\u2019s absolutely necessary for your readers to know.\n\nI\u2019ll ask myself, \u201cIs this paragraph of description necessary? Is this back-story necessary?\u201d\n\nWhen you reach a climatic moment in your piece, however, you\u2019ll want to slow down the pace of your writing to keep your readers in suspense. It will give the writing a breathless quality.\n\nHart quotes Pulitzer-Prize winner Tom French,\n\n\u201cThe reason you slow down is so that the reader can really feel and process and really enter that scene\u2026And how do you slow down?\u2026You allow more space on the page. You allow more sentences. You literally write in shorter sentences. You get more paragraph breaks. You use space. You find pauses inside the scene that occur naturally that you would normally skip over.\u201d\n\nI wrote more about varying sentence structure in my article below:\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThese seven editing tips are simple and straightforward. You can start using them right away to make your writing more engaging and fast-paced.\n\nBy following these tips, you\u2019ll better hold the attention of your readers and, thus, be more effective at sharing your message with the world.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to strengthen your writing and storytelling skills, I definitely recommend getting a copy of Hart\u2019s book. It\u2019s an in-depth read with lots of fantastic actionable advice.",

        "title": "Predicting The Protein Structures Using AI",
        "text": "Proteins are found essentially in all organisms, and they are basically a sequence of amino acids that are arranged in a particular structure. For many decades, scientists have been able to accurately compute the sequence of amino acids, but however, accurately predicting the structure of the protein has always been a challenging task. If we are able to decode the sequence of the amino acids in the protein structure and accurately determine the structure of the protein, then it will serve a number of functions.\n\nAccurate prediction of protein structure will be very helpful in understanding the biological evolution of that particular protein and it will also help us understand the kind of diseases it can cause and the kind of defense it can provide against other diseases.\n\nEssentially, accurate prediction of the structure of the protein is the key to understand the function of proteins and cells and as well as to understand how they can malfunction and cause diseases and this understanding could also be very helpful in the development of treatment and vaccines.\n\nNow, if you look at the SARS-CoV-2, it is the spike protein structure of the Virus that latches onto the AS2 receptor in our cells, thereby leading to the occurrence of the infection. We have been able to develop this understanding quite quickly, mainly because of the progress that we have made with regard to our understanding and prediction of protein structures.\n\nFirst Discovery\n\nSee, this field began evolving many decades ago, and back in 1972, a scientist known as Christian B. Anfinsen predicted that by accurately computing the sequence of amino acids, we will be able to deduce the protein structure. So this discovery won him the Nobel Prize for chemistry and it laid the foundation for analysis and prediction of protein structures.\n\nX-ray Crystallography\n\nThen nearly 60 years ago a scientist known as Max Perutz started to predict protein structures by using experiments. He made use of X-ray crystallography to determine the exact structure of myoglobin and hemoglobin and it was this discovery that helped us understand the true function of hemoglobin in the blood, which is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and cells. This understanding of the structure of myoglobin and hemoglobin also helped us understand how a change in a single amino acid can cause diseases such as sickle cell anemia.\n\nGenome Sequencing\n\nToday, decoding the sequence of amino acids and accurately completing the sequence has become more advanced, thanks to the progress achieved in genome sequencing. Because at the end of the day, the protein structures in the amino acids are essentially a part of the genome itself and the rapid advances we have made in genome sequencing have helped us to easily compute the sequence of amino acids. But however, when it comes to creating a 3D structure of the protein, these experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc., can be quite ineffective and they\u2019re also very time consuming and expensive.\n\nIndia\u2019s Contribution\n\nWhen it comes to the field of protein structural work. Even India is a leading country because an Indian scientist known as GN Ramachandran developed the Ramachandran plot, which today has become the model for scientists around the world to understand the structure of proteins.\n\nCASP Technique\n\nThen in 1994, a scientist known as John Moult came up with the CASP technique, which stands for Critical Assessment for Protein Structure Prediction, and this is provided for a comparative model through which protein structures can be predicted.\n\nSpecialty Of AI\n\nBut however, predicting protein structures is a very complex and challenging exercise, especially when you\u2019re relying upon traditional experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. This is where the emergence of artificial intelligence has caused a major disruption in the field of protein structure prediction. In 2018, a company known as Deep Mind made use of artificial intelligence and deep learning to come out with a predictive algorithm, which today has emerged as a breakthrough technology that can accurately predict protein structure.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese advances made in the production of protein structure with the usage of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms have transformed our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 and it has definitely enabled the accelerated development of vaccines.\n\nGain Access to Expert View \u2014 Subscribe to DDI Intel",

        "title": "NEXT 2018 \u2014 Google crossing the cloud chasm?",
        "text": "Last week I had a great time at NEXT in San Francisco where Google audaciously, in front of 25,000 people outlined where it is heading with Google Cloud. Below is my synthesis on the vast amount of material that was conveyed.\n\nOnly 5\u201310% of payloads that will end up on public cloud, have been migrated\n\nIt was highlighted a couple of times that only a fraction of possible payloads are on public cloud. My inner history nerd took note, having long been a fan of Geoffrey Moore\u2019s seminal book, \u201cCrossing the Chasm\u201d and it\u2019s technology adoption curve. It is universally acknowledged that in regards to public cloud, Amazon won the early phases. Google and others are working hard to compete, but the stat outlines the main prize is still up for grabs.\n\nWhat I witnessed at NEXT, was Dianne Greene and her team\u2019s play on how they are working to cross the chasm, to win the early majority phase. Something Dianne and many of her team achieved at VMWare and virtualisation.\n\nArtificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\n\nGoogle\u2019s play on AI was threaded through the whole week. The message has evolved to be a little more tempered and nuanced. Companies who harness AI will be enhancing experiences rather than taking over the world with Daleks or drones. Conversational AI in the call centre looks imminent. Dialogflow had a phone gateway and sentiment features added. For companies willing to invest, the opportunity to have a cost effective, but yet engaging \u201cAI enabled\u201d triage process on the phone, or in online chat for better customer engagement outcomes can start to be achieved.\n\nI have led a number of Cloud Vision API projects in the past 6 months. AutoML Vision will add a bump to accuracy over the generic vision models without the need for a team of data engineers and data scientists to manage a neural net pipeline. AutoML will be comparatively easy to use for those who understand stats and and can use an API.\n\nDeploying the new mobile Edge TPU processors with TensorFlow Lite gives a path to embedding ML algorithms at remote sides with hardware acceleration to provide real time feedback. Useful for miners, manufacturing plants and the like. I expect the initial use cases to be initially deployed on stock Android devices running TensorFlow Lite without the hardware acceleration.\n\nI participated in a Business Transformation workshop where we worked up and pitched ideas on how to expand the impact of Wildbook, which is crowd sourcing video and camera phone images to help track individual animals via their markings. This collectively enables the mapping of endangered species and their human interaction. Their solution uses a combination of GCP Cloud ML APIs and custom Tensorflow models. All open sourced and available for budding data scientists to look at.\n\nFrom Data to Insights\n\nGoogle\u2019s advantage in data tooling is being pressed home. BigQuery just keeps getting better and better with announcement at NEXT in regards to Machine Learning and Geolocation. Tino Tereshko the BigQuery Product Manager, graciously provided some time with Graham Polley and myself on Friday after the conference, my takeaway \u2014 the BQ roadmap has a mix of continuous improvement and cool shiny new things. It is only going to get more powerful, more capable, while still being easy to use.\n\nBigQuery as a Marketing Data platform also emerged through a number of marketing related sessions \u2014 a space, we at Servian are excited to be working in. GCP and BigQuery gives Marketing and Customer Experience the power to ingest and process various data sources to personalise customer journeys while being responsive to marketers needs. There were a number of use cases where leading brands in the USA were using GCP to give visibility of attribution, and provide personalisation insights to improve outcomes. At Servian, we see this becoming more common as GPDR, privacy concerns and CFOs nudge marketers towards adopting techniques aligned to enterprise data approaches. It will require these techniques to be deployed on well architected and managed cloud solutions to provide the flexibility marketers need to be effective.\n\nThe boring data privacy stuff is also being addressed. The Data Loss Prevention API can scan, redact and tokenize any sensitive data on static or streaming data.\n\nDeveloping & running applications\n\nKelsey Hightower in his \u201ccontainer\u201d on stage\n\nFor developers, Google showed off its natural engineering flair. Kelsey Hightower rocked the stage in the Keynote on Day 3. Cloud Build, KNative serverless containers, all add capabilities to the platform. They help the speed and ease of developing code and then testing, deploying plus running it. Google are also making their platform capabilities easier to leverage by development teams through open source projects such as Spring Cloud and Go-cloud.\n\nGKE On Prem running in VSphere\n\nAll the above however does not provide a runtime bridge to on prem data centres. GKE On Prem however does. Many companies use cloud for dev/test and run production in their on prem data centres. Google have just provided an end to end way to support this hybrid pattern through its combo of Kubernetes, Istio and GKE on Prem under its unified Cloud Services Platform .\n\nGoogle\u2019s acquisition of Velostrata was also detailed. Velostrata provides tooling support for Google Cloud customers that enables VMWare or AWS migrations to GCP with minimum down time, and rollback if needed. Google bought a migration bridge to compliment the runtime bridge they built.\n\nSecurity\n\nMany enterprise security stakeholders express concerns about public cloud vendors and their PaaS style services which are typically exposed on internet facing endpoints. They want them to be secured within a VPC. Google announced their answer to this customer need with VPC Service Controls entering Beta.\n\nIstio is addressing a need to secure service interactions but with a policy managed approach. There are a number of financial services organisations who have built this kind of service mesh or dynamic secure networking capability themselves. Istio provides an open source approach to meeting this need. Google are once again making this easy to operate with Istio part of its Cloud Services Platform, PaaS style service. I think many people are missing that Istio can be applied beyond micro-services, with the Istio Mesh Expansion. Once it matures a little more, it will be able to extend the service mesh beyond Kubernetes to secure traditional 2/3 tier applications. Thus bringing observability and policy driven security on service interactions. All of this able to be undertaken, without impacting application code \u2014 providing secure operational agility beyond what is typically achieved in many on-prem environments.\n\nGoogle\u2019s BeyondCorp model which outlines defence in depth for employee enterprise applications had a range of security capabilities outlined at NEXT including an Identity aware proxy for internal applications, geo-aware Cloud Armor DDOS protection and the Titan security key for 2 Factor Authentication.\n\nIn Summary\n\nDiane Greene, her ex-VMWare crew plus the rest of the Googlers lifted the curtain on their capability roadmap at NEXT. With so much to take in, it is only when I have stepped back, that I appreciated the strategic vision, direction and focus. What I believe is clear, is that, as the announcements from NEXT move to be generally available over the next 12 months. Google Cloud will have a clear, coherent end to end public cloud capability.\n\nThe remaining question then will be, whether or not Google and their partners get the marketing right to cross the chasm by winning the hearts and minds of customers to buy into Google Cloud.\n\nThe has beens \u2014 beer miler, e-gamer and sprinter\n\nFrom a personal viewpoint, I had a really enjoyable panel discussion on stage with Jon Fong, Jason Martin and Dhruv Parpia on running a successful cloud practice.\n\nIn regards to San Fran, it was 3 years between visits \u2014 Americans seems to be using the term \u2018mobile\u2019 now in contrast to \u2018cell\u2019, when describing their phones \u2014 not sure when that happened. Skateboarding is back. The contrast between the wealth and poverty seemed to be starker. Looking up at the multiple gleaming Salesforce office towers provided a sobering backdrop against many of the poor on the streets.\n\nhttps://www.servian.com/gcp/",

        "text": "Do Headlines Really Make a Difference?\n\nFirst impressions count\n\nIllustration by Cynthia Marinakos\n\nIt gets a little confusing.\n\nWhat really gets writers noticed?\n\nQuality writing.

        "title": "Unleash the Potential of AI in Circular Economy: Businesses Potentials",
        "text": "Business Potential of AI in promoting circular Economy\n\n1. Environmental impact analysis and monitoring\n\nFrom CSR to ESG, most businesses today have good intentions to stand up to their environmental and social responsibilities. Nevertheless, in order for them to reduce its environmental impact, they need to first estimate the effect of their activities in quantitative means. Producing such estimates could be challenging, especially for large businesses involved in multiple chains of production and distribution. This can be resolved by the use of IOT ( Internet of Things) and smart sensors. IOT allows automation of accurate and reliable data collection, which could then be fed into data analytic algorithms that outputs analysis of the different sources externalities or pollutions. Businesses could gain insights from these analysis and take actions. For example, by identifying the greatest source of residuals or pollutants in a manufacturing procedure businesses could invest in developing or switching to more efficient production methods to cut their impact.\n\nimage via pixabay under Pixabay License (Free for commercial use)\n\n2. Big data powered product innovation\n\nUsing big data, product development can be done in a more evidence based manner. Two of the main product features that would be desirable for circular economy are modularity and durability. The benefits of greater durability is obvious by itself, on the other hand, modularity means to decompose a complex product engineering process into simple subparts. Greater modularity could then make product remanufacturing and recycling more convenient, it \u201cpermit the arrangement of components in a manner that can be easily modified, enhanced, exchanged, or proliferated.\u201d (Tucker J. Marion, 2010) During the process of product development, data can be collected from prototyping and testing of the product. These data can now be analyzed iteratively through machine learning algorithms, which assists with the evaluation of these desirable sustainable product features and could be used to improve upon current design of products\n\n3. Blockchain and cryptographic anchoring for supply chain management\n\nAnother challenge in tracking and recognizing environmental impact of businesses is the difficulties in reliably following and trace back to the source of its inputs. What blockchain could do is to make the whole supply chain \u201ctransparent\u201d, where each stage in the chain is recorded in an immutable way. Imagine you operate a small restaurant, to provide tasty dishes to customers, you would need to purchase the ingredients. To make it simpler, let\u2019s only focus on the meat supplier. In order to know whether the meat supplier is operating in an ethical and sustainable production process, you need to know which livestock farm did they get their \u201cinputs\u201d from. If you would like to dig deeper, you might also want to know the source of the food they fed to the livestock. This could quickly get complex and difficult to track, and that is indeed a general concern of many businesses, especially for those that have to manage a large variety of suppliers, such as Walmart. Indeed, Walmart was one of the earliest adopters to test the application of supply chain management using blockchain by using it to trace pork in China, to authenticate transactions and facilitate accurate and efficient record keeping.\n\nExample of blockchain digital supply chain (Oliver Wyman) \u2014 Copyright \u00a9 2018, Oliver Wyman\n\n4. Smart inventory management\n\nimage via pixabay under Pixabay License (Free for commercial use)\n\nSmart inventory management mainly concerns with the accurate prediction of customer demand to efficiently produce the right amount of product at the right time. Stockpiling could be extremely wasteful and costly for a business, especially in cases where the product cannot be stored for a long period of time, either because of the nature of the product (fresh food), or because of the decrease in value of product over time (fashion products). By using internal data such as records of past sales, customer preferences and external data such as competitor\u2019s performances, market demand fluctuations and patterns, AI\u2019s prediction capabilities can be utilized to prevent stockpiling and excess inventories. This not only reduces the inventory rental cost for companies, but also greatly lowered the amount of waste and unused products that may impede for transition to a circular economy. There are already wide use of smart inventory management using Internet of things and machine learning, an example of such service provider is \u201cZenventory\u201d.\n\n5. Automated Optimizing Delivery and Shipping\n\nThe use of AI have enabled us to improve the logistics of shipping and delivery by designing the fastest route. On one hand it could analyze customer order data to make best plan for shipping in different regions, on the other hand real-time traffic data can be used to produce efficient scheduling of deliveries. Moreover, the scope of AI usage in delivery extends beyond backend planning to autonomous shipping. In 2018, Rolls Royce and Finferries launched the first fully autonomous car ferry. The cost advantages of using autonomous truck in B2C (business to customer) last mile delivery is substantial, with potential of reducing delivery costs by 10% comparing to traditional delivery method ( McKinsey,2018). The design of the fastest route reduced the amount of pollutants created by shipping vehicles , especially for oversea shipping, while autonomous delivery act as a solution to effective, low manual input delivery, allowing more funds and human resources to be devoted to more productive usage.",

It is to think and to make others think.\n\nThis is a hard job today. It isn\u2019t because people are getting dumber (although it seems that way at times).

        "title": "What It\u2019s Like to Have an ADHD Brain",
        "text": "What It\u2019s Like to Have an ADHD Brain\n\nAnd how I found refuge from the nonstop chaos inside my own head\n\nI\u2019ve always sought comfort in familiar things. I rewatch the same TV shows. I reread the same books. I listen to the same songs for months on end. My routine isn\u2019t about scheduling \u2014 it\u2019s about having a shortlist of familiar activities. It feels as if I\u2019m trying to escape my own spinning brain.\n\nNo two people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) present the exact same way, but there are commonalities. The vast majority of adults with ADHD, for instance, aren\u2019t hyperactive on the outside, but on the inside.\n\nThe moment my head touches a pillow, my brain starts doing somersaults. Intrusive thoughts rear their ugly heads. Remember when you made that girl cry in the sixth grade because you wouldn\u2019t stop poking her? Remember when you said \u201cshit happens\u201d in that job interview? Oh, remember that time you drank too much champagne on a date and ran crying out of The Hunger Games?\n\nMost often, though, it\u2019s half-baked big ideas that turn my mind into a clown car. Ideas for work. Ideas for a new book. Ideas for the nursery for a baby who doesn\u2019t exist yet. The world is full of endless possibilities to contemplate, and my brain has no idea where to put them all. They just tumble around in there like balls in a lottery machine.\n\nIn the ADHD brain, the team is short-staffed.\n\nTuning things out is another formidable task. William Dodson, MD, an adult ADHD specialist in Denver, Colorado, writes in ADDitude that many people with ADHD have amplified senses, making it hard for us to block out stimulation. I hate shirt tags. I don\u2019t like being touched unexpectedly. Loud music in the morning stresses me out. I turn my phone upside down on my nightstand so I can\u2019t see the gently pulsing light as it charges. Ambient noise is my escape from nocturnal household sounds \u2014 ticking clocks are torture, and I live in fear of night-owl neighbors with booming baritone voices. Even in winter, I would sleep with an oscillating fan facing the wall until my husband bought me a white-noise machine.\n\nI\u2019ve developed good habits. I take medication. I make to-do lists every morning. My desk is plastered in sticky notes. I don\u2019t play music while I work \u2014 I\u2019ll just end up listening to it \u2014 but my trusty fan helps muffle the sound of my brain arguing with itself. I keep pages upon pages of overlapping projects. It\u2019s not uncommon for individuals with ADHD to have trouble visualizing an entire task from start to finish. I pick up one thread, follow it for a bit, grab several more along the way, and before I know it, I\u2019m holding a tangled ball of yarn. As I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve developed the patience to occasionally pull a thread free.\n\nBefore I learned how to manage my time, deadlines would appear out of nowhere, and at the 11th hour I would find the motivation to churn out a final product in record time. I\u2019ve often felt like the hare keeping up with the tortoise \u2014 aimless wandering punctuated by frantic spurts of focused energy.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to channel a common but counterintuitive feature of ADHD called hyperfocus. I sit down to work at 8:30 a.m., and suddenly it\u2019s 3:45 p.m. Normally this only happens to people with ADHD when they\u2019re doing something they enjoy, so it\u2019s a good sign that I like my job. Of course, it also means that my house looks like it was hit by a tornado and I often forget to eat lunch.\n\nWhen I do get out of \u201cthe zone,\u201d all of my unfocused thoughts clamor for attention. The brain\u2019s reward pathway has a built-in executive team in the corpus striatum, which helps filter the constant influx of thoughts and emotions and file them in their proper places. Some items should be addressed right away, some can wait, and many go straight to the trash. Occasionally, the team sends the single most important item on the agenda up to the prefrontal cortex for attention.\n\nIn the ADHD brain, the team is short-staffed. Everything \u2014 including the trash \u2014 goes into one big pile of equal importance. Dodson writes that stimulants work by providing support to the team \u2014 helping the striatum choose the single most important task, rather than half a dozen at once.\n\nYet there\u2019s one thing ADHD brains are really good at: recognizing things they want to do and things they don\u2019t.\n\nMotivation is a chemical reaction. Ellen Littman, PhD, a clinical psychologist in New York, writes that the ADHD brain\u2019s reward pathway is off-balance; it takes a lot more dopamine to make us feel happy or satisfied. Reward deficiency syndrome (RDS), a term coined by Kenneth Blum, PhD, makes it extremely difficult to muster the willpower to perform mundane tasks \u2014 even important ones \u2014 if they don\u2019t pack a big enough dopamine punch. Novelty-seeking behavior is common. Some people with ADHD might become firefighters, drive recklessly, or abuse substances in their search for a boost. RDS is linked to procrastination and addiction, both common features of ADHD. Some might call it a lack of willpower. They\u2019d be right, in a way, but it comes down to brain chemistry \u2014 not laziness.\n\nPut simply, we\u2019re the donkey, and dopamine is the carrot. The only carrot.\n\nYet not every ADHD brain is an adrenaline junkie. Littman writes that individuals with more hypersensitive ADHD may be living in a constant state of sensory overload. With so much stimulation and no way to compartmentalize it, these people might avoid crowds or loud venues. Many seek refuge in video games, where they experience dopamine boosts but have control over the amount of sensory input.\n\nThe world is full of endless possibilities to contemplate, and my brain has no idea where to put them all.\n\nI seem to have feet in both camps. I\u2019ll gladly jump off a cliff, perform CPR, ride roller coasters, visit new places, or drive a four-wheeler down a highway. But when the time comes to regain control over the level of stimulation, I extract myself and seek refuge in familiar, comfortable activities. Novel experiences during this time \u2014 Watch this YouTube video! Try ordering something fun for dinner! Take a different route home! \u2014 become less friendly, adding to a feeling of bombardment and stress. To escape the chaos and get my dopamine boost, I watch Lord of the Rings over and over again while I play Candy Crush. I work out to the same playlist of 20 songs. I play familiar piano pieces. I read Harry Potter for the dozenth time.\n\nThe psychology of ADHD makes sense of these behaviors. \u201cPeople with ADD find various ways of self-soothing. It can [help] to have a routine and repeat it over and over again,\u201d says psychiatrist Ned Hallowell, MD, founder of the Hallowell Centers and author of Driven to Distraction. \u201cThey look to alter their inner state. I call that the \u2018itch\u2019 at the core of ADHD. Some of the most adaptive ways to scratch that itch are having a creative outlet, physical exercise, or close relationships. The maladaptive ways are compulsive activities, gambling, substance abuse, surfing the net, video games, those kinds of things.\u201d\n\nSandy Newmark, MD, founder of the Center for Pediatric Integrative Medicine and author of ADHD Without Drugs: A Guide to the Natural Care of Children with ADHD, agrees. \u201cA lot of kids with ADHD also have a sensory processing disorder\u2026If they have the kind where they\u2019re over-sensitive [or inattentive], that might be a reason to seek familiar activities\u2026I can see how it would be soothing.\u201d In my case, this behavior has carried itself into my adult life, which is not uncommon in ADHD.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that for people with ADHD in particular, every escape is also an entrance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving one place, but you\u2019re entering another,\u201d Hallowell says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re watching TV, you\u2019re entering into the world of the TV show. When you\u2019re going on a ride at an amusement park, you\u2019re escaping into the thrill of the ride. When you\u2019re escaping into\u2026a drug, you\u2019re entering into the world that drug creates for you. You\u2019re never escaping into nothing.\u201d\n\nDespite the chaos, people with ADHD excel at the things we enjoy. We have a remarkable ability to channel our energy into creative pursuits \u2014 writing, journalism, music, design, teaching, freelance work. We are constantly tempted to escape the mundane and chase what makes us happy. With healthy habits, support, and good communication, this can lead us to incredibly fulfilling lives.\n\nI like to imagine a world where more people chased what made them happy, instead of what they think they\u2019re supposed to do. In that, I think we ADHD brains have it all figured out.",

Good for them. Be happy for them, even if the only reason you are happy for them is that complaining will not be good for your writing career.\n\nThere is a lot of negativity online. Don\u2019t add to it. People aren\u2019t attracted to people who complain and approach anything with a \u201cwhoa is me\u201d attitude.\n\nWe all have pangs of envy and jealousy.\n\nI read an article in The Atlantic last night that had me really questioning if I\u2019d ever be a great writer; that doesn\u2019t really matter; the only thing that matters is if I like to write and whether I think it is worth time. I do.\n\nIf you wonder why some writers take-off faster than you, you are putting your energy in the wrong place. You may think, I can\u2019t believe so and so wrote that piece, and it has X amount of views; it isn\u2019t even very good. I can write a better piece than that four minute piece of\u2026\n\nWell, you didn\u2019t write that four-minute piece of \u2026that everyone seems to love. You didn\u2019t come up with the idea or articulate it in a way that resonates.\n\nInstead of concentrating on why you think they don\u2019t deserve x and x, put that energy into writing better.\n\nDo this instead.\n\nOne way of getting out of the comparison trap you put yourself in with other writers is to remember that growth happens when we compare ourselves to our own evolution.\n\nReal growth doesn\u2019t come from measuring ourselves against others but from measuring our progress. Compare yourself now to yourself a month ago, three months ago, a year ago. Then, plan what you want your life to look like three months, six months, or a year from now.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about what others are doing; put sustained effort into your writing journey and find out what you are capable of, and your writing life will expand exponentially. Complaining that you aren\u2019t as far as such and such when you started earlier only increases that burden.\n\nWhen I find myself in the comparison trap or dealing with \u201cimposter syndrome,\u201d I ask myself, what do I want, what could I do to grow my writing chops?\n\nThen I answer the question. It is usually something straightforward, like read a book on writing or take a writing class. And then, I do it. I\u2019m continually pushing myself to get better, and one of the ways I do this is sitting down to write every day.",

        "text": "\u201cIf you live for the love of other\u2019s, you will die from their rejection.\u201d Lecrae\n\nFollowers, claps, likes, and views all have one thing in common \u2014 they\u2019re distractions. These stats distract from the reason you started writing to begin with and that\u2019s to create quality content that people everyone can enjoy reading.\n\nWe already live in a world with too many distractions. Our faces are magnetized to our cell phones, we have jobs to do to pay bills, and too many social media notifications is constantly barking at us like a dog that you forgot to feed. It\u2019s a constant feeling of overwhelm and it can take away from your artistic quality.\n\nThis feeling of overwhelm is elevated even more so, when you allow it to interfere with your work as a writer. Whether you write as a passion or as means to generate revenue, it\u2019s always important to maintain creative control of your work. When you allow superficial concepts such as followers and claps to determine your work, your writing will inevitably suffer. Nothing you write will feel good enough because you\u2019re constantly searching for external approval instead of allowing your creativity to take over. At this point, you\u2019re no wonder a writer but an entertainer to the masses.\n\nI have personally struggled with this myself and I\u2019m only recently learning to cut through the overwhelm and prioritize my writing. I have at least ten different drafts that I have started but never finished due to a fear that none of it will be good enough. This has been going on for the past three months but its been a constant life struggle for me.\n\nFor example, you start writing then you lose hope that it will amount to anything because you have very few followers and no claps on your past articles. Maybe you publish your article but notifications never go off on your Medium app so you slowly lose interest and wondering if you\u2019re wasting your time. That\u2019s my struggle with validation and it may be your struggle as well.\n\nRecently, after my 26th birthday, I came to the realization that if I ever want to be a great writer, I have to do it for myself and no one else.\n\nHere are some tactics to get away from external approval and focus on where it matters: writing quality content.",

        "title": "5 Reasons Why You Find It Hard To Wake Up At Early Everyday",
        "text": "There\u2019s been quite a bit of talk on the internet both for and against waking up at 5 AM in the morning. As someone who has religiously woken up early and also outright avoided it, I have arguments on both sides. What I\u2019ve come to the conclusion, though, is that while it certainly can be beneficial \u2014 it certainly isn\u2019t necessary for being productive.\n\nBusiness Insider, Inc. Magazine and Fast Company have all recently published articles about how waking up early can actually be harmful to your productivity. While it has been helpful and can be proof of someone\u2019s self-discipline and aspirations, it isn\u2019t necessary and isn\u2019t necessarily the key.\n\nHere are some reminders as to why you shouldn\u2019t force yourself to wake up early if it isn\u2019t helpful for you:\n\n1 || You find that you resent yourself for following the 5 am crowd\n\nMost people start waking up early, not because of their desire to get a head start on things, but because they heard that one successful person did it and wanted to follow suit.\n\nThe problem is, when you so aggressively follow the proverbial crowd, you\u2019ll start to resent yourself and the activity of waking up early every day, rain or shine. Waking up early on a consistent basis is not easy and it doesn\u2019t come naturally to most people. If you don\u2019t get in touch with a solid why for waking up early, you\u2019ll wake up lost, tired, confused, and resentful of this obscure habit you\u2019re trying to establish for no apparent reason.\n\n2 || You deprive yourself of sunlight\n\nI didn\u2019t realize this until weeks into my 5 AM habit \u2014 that waking up early when the sun didn\u2019t rise until 6:30 AM, like now, meant that I was awake, in the dark, alone, for an hour and a half. As a social person and a human being who requires sunlight to maintain a high quality of life, this was pretty harmful to my psyche.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, women who don\u2019t sunbathe are twice as more likely to die than those who do sunbathe every summer. While this isn\u2019t exactly an argument for not waking up at 5 AM, it does provide an interesting point. Being around sunlight is healthy, and improves both our physical and emotional health. This is especially important in the mornings.\n\n3 || You negate the importance of high-quality sleep\n\nWaking up in the morning isn\u2019t inherently bad. The problems begin to arise when you value waking up early over getting high-quality sleep. While some people are able to wake up and operate with under 4 hours of sleep, most people need somewhere between 7\u20139 hours of sleep.\n\nSetting your alarm for 5 AM every day isn\u2019t helpful to you if you\u2019re never getting enough sleep. And not only would you be depriving yourself of sleep, but you would also be reinforcing the false idea in your mind that sleep isn\u2019t important. My story, 10 Ways To Guarantee Better Sleep, can give you some ideas on how to sleep better and how to develop a mindset that knows the importance of sleep.\n\n4 || You\u2019re losing your social life\n\nOkay, okay. I know this one is a little bit extreme, but it\u2019s true. If you are trying to value sleep, have a solid routine, and also want to be around people and be active late at night with said party people, you\u2019re not going to be able to have that much of social life.\n\nWhen people want to hang out with you or invite you out for a night on the town, you\u2019re not able to do so because you have to stick to your schedule. Committing to wake up at 5 AM every morning takes away your flexibility in a way that can make you say no to things you don\u2019t want to \u2014 just so you can have an extra hour or two in the morning. You have to ask, is this worth it? Most of the time, prioritizing your favorite people over your morning routine is the better decision.\n\n5 || You know you can experience a different kind of productivity at night\n\nThere are actual genes in your body associated with whether you\u2019re a morning person or a night owl. If you happen to be someone who\u2019s more naturally a night owl in accordance with your circadian rhythm, rejecting the trend of waking up at 5 AM in the morning could actually be the best choice you make in terms of being more productive in the long run.\n\nI, personally, have never felt more inclined towards waking up early in the morning or staying up late at night. I enjoy both and try and enjoy different parts at during different seasons in my life. But what I have noticed about the evening is that, when the sun is going down and my brain\u2019s slowing down, processing the day, and slowly falling asleep, I\u2019m less inhibited and am more willing to be creative.",

        "title": "Ecosystem restoration, reviving hope.",
        "text": "Photo by Nikola Jovanovic on Unsplash\n\nLand degradation is a worldwide issue affecting more than 3.2 billion. When the land is degraded through soil erosion, salinization or pollution, it loses its wildlife and its ecosystem services.\n\nIn the future, it will be important to rehabilitate degraded landscapes and seascape to restore their productivity. Moreover, land restoration is especially important to mitigate climate change as forests, coral reefs and wetlands can store a huge quantity of carbon.\n\nAs young people are taking the streets to call for climate action and asking adults to join the next global climate strike in September, a momentum is taking shape and open an opportunity to push governments to act against climate change.\n\n\u201cNow that people are aware of the existential threat of climate change, we must give them solutions\u201d\n\nPeople have a lot of energy and are eager to change the status quo, but how do we channel this energy to have the biggest impact? That is the question asked by Tim Christophersen, focal point for the UN decade project for land restoration. In a webinar last week on land restoration, he stressed that everybody has a role to play in this mass movement but not everybody knows what to do. For example, people can plant the wrong trees at a bad time, bad place and the tree can die, and once a farmer experience failure, he will never plant a tree again.\n\nTim Christophersen highlighted that \u201cthe momentum comes after many years of work in land restoration, and that now we have a large knowledge about terrestrial ecosystem restoration but also marine ecosystem restoration like mangroves and coral reefs. Now that people are aware of the existential threat of climate change, we must give them solutions and shift negative views to the opportunities we have\u201d.\n\n\u201cinspiring action by measuring the potential of land restoration to stop climate change\u201d\n\nThomas Crowther and Jean Francois Bastin, two researchers from the university ETH Zurich explained the goal of their research: \u201cinspiring action by measuring the potential of land restoration to stop climate change\u201d. With such measure, people can understand the size of the problem and how they can contribute to solve it. At the webinar organized by the Global Landscape Forum, Thomas Crowther gave an interesting example: \u201cthere are 300 extra gigaton of CO2 in the atmosphere, this is the size of the problem. If everybody stops to eat meat, it is 66 gigaton which will not be emitted\u201d.\n\nThe two researchers did the same kind of calculation for land restoration around the globe using geospatial and ecological data. They have mapped how much tree can grow in each part of the world. The model they developed was based on the biophysical data of protected areas. Then, they extrapolated to all the globe to see how much trees could grow around the globe. This model finally gave information about the potential of land restoration to reduce climate change.\n\nWhen everybody thinks about geoengineering and technological solutions, people forget that natural solutions are also an option. According to the results of the research which will be published next month in Science, Jean Francois Bastin affirms that ecosystem restoration will be the first climate solution in the world.\n\n\u201c\u2026because planting trees is not the only way to restore a land\u201d\n\nTo uncover the potential of land restoration, there are many challenges to overcome. Mathilde Iweins, an expert of ecosystem services and local finance at the FAO, listed 7 challenges to widely implement land restoration.\n\nFirst, many countries lack of coordination between their stakeholders within governments and ministries. Planning must be more integrative and in agreement with the people doing restoration otherwise new infrastructure may be built on a restored area.\n\nSecond, land tenure issues must be solved, and farmers should receive land titles otherwise they will not be motivated to care and restore the land.\n\nThird, trainings about new types of land restoration must be created and shared because planting trees is not the only way to restore a land.\n\nForth, restoration must be linked to livelihood so people can see the benefits they can receive through land restoration.\n\nFifth, financial partnership must be created as the public sector cannot tackle the problem by itself. The private sector must be involved and see the economic benefits of land restoration.\n\nSixth, biophysical and social effect of land restoration must be monitored, evaluated and linked to a cost-benefit analysis. Such analysis will show investors the benefits to restore degraded land.\n\nLastly, restoration does not happen fast, and time will be needed. In a system where international donors expect results after 4 years; restoration project does not have enough time.\n\nFortunately, restoration projects are already ongoing and international donors have already invested 50 million USD to start a dozen of projects in 10 countries. These projects which were developed in the same way, are part of an initiative of global knowledge sharing and capacity building. All these projects use the same monitoring and evaluation methods as well as the same set of biophysical and social indicators. Thanks to that, these projects are generating comparable data about their benefits and challenges so we can improve the implementation and financing of future projects.\n\n\u201cit is a crucial and cheap tool we can use to solve climate change\u201d\n\nThere is a lot to be learnt as there is no golden bullet, and land restoration is a constant experimentation. Countries, especially in the global south, will need assistance to carry on large-scale restoration projects. They will have to learn how to use geospatial data and online platforms to find the suitable land to restore. If we can manage all the challenges and harness the potential of land restoration, it is a crucial and cheap tool we can use to solve climate change.",

        "text": "Music Star Alex Boye Is Doing an Anti-Suicide Concert. The Former Member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Performed in an Anti-Gay Marriage Event. Does He Have Regrets? Rhett Wilkinson Follow Aug 21, 2019 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nJust six years ago, Alex Boye entrenched himself in the predominant culture in Utah when he performed in opposition to gay marriage. And that was already while benefitting from the same culture. Boye performed for seven years for the choir representing the Latter-day Saint (ex-Mormon) church. That\u2019s the institution underlying the predominant culture in Utah that is marginalizing the depressed and suicidal, many of whom are gay.\n\nAlex Boye, already a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir at the time, entrenched himself into the predominant culture in Utah when performing at an anti-gay marriage concert. In doing a concert against gay marriage, does Boye have regrets? (photo credit: DSU Indeen)\n\nNow, Boye is doing a concert in the very same town as where he proclaimed opposition to gay marriage. But this time, to go against suicides, even though it seems clear that some of the suicides are a result of marginalization of gays by that predominant culture.\n\n(Jan Chamberlin left the choir when she thought it was wrong to benefit from a cultural item.)\n\nA Boye spokeswoman pointed The Seer Stone to a video Boye released about why he believes in fighting suicides. Boye said he had an impression to write a song, now called \u201cBend Not Break.\u201d The night he told music engineers that \u2014 and that they needed to not go home yet but work on the song \u2014 is the same night as the one-year anniversary of one of the engineer\u2019s best friend taking his life. The best friend said that night that he had thought about one thing he could have said to his friend to make him change his mind.\n\nClick here for the video.\n\nBoye also talks about the Herriman, Utah community supporting Boye making a music video in the area about suicide prevention. Boye also said that he gets messages from therapists who show Boye\u2019s music video to patients.\n\nAlex Boye talks about why he believes in suicide prevention. (photo credit: Alex Boye via YouTube)\n\n\u201cI feel like all my dreams are coming through just through this one song,\u201d Boye said after talking further about life experiences that informed his making the music video.\n\nA Boye colleague told Boye: \u201cWhen you release this song, it will define your whole career.\u201d\n\nOne girl went from cutting herself, hating herself, to feeling \u201cthe chills\u201d after listening to the song for the first time.\n\n\u201cSomething in of her just kind of registered. And she said \u2018I\u2019m never going to do this anymore,\u2019\u201d Boye said. \u201cShe sends messages every now and then; she said \u2018Look, I\u2019ve struggled at times, but I\u2019ve never gone that far.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mind-blowing for me,\u201d Boye said.\n\nClick here for the music video.\n\n\u2014\n\nEven if you no longer affiliate with the Latter-day Saint (ex-Mormon) church but enjoy sociality with family and friends as before, you can still find social settings organized by the Utah Valley PostMormons. There, you can find your people. And of course, if you don\u2019t enjoy those relationships like before, the many UVPM events that happen each week can be even life-saving.\n\nLed by wonderful people, UVPM is also for folks who just are struggling with it or are \u201cnever Mormons\u201d seeking a break from the predominant culture. Find their events on Facebook and Meetup.\n\n\u2014\n\nFor more articles like this, please support The Seer Stone at the Hero\u2019s Journey Content Patreon page.",

        "title": "Datalake File Ingestion: From FTP to AWS S3",
        "text": "More insight into our code:\n\nLets now discuss each section of our FTPIngestion class in some detail.\n\ninit method\n\nThis is the init method also called as the constructor of our class. When we create an object of our FTPIngestion class all the attributes get set at object creation time. Values for each attribute are being fetched from the config.py class where we have defined their values. We import the config.py file as cfg and set each attribute with its corresponding value.\n\ninit method\n\nRecommendation: instead of using the config.py class we can use AWS SSM where we define our key value pairs for each of our attribute just like we did in our config.py file. Using SSM is more robust and secure.\n\ncreate_ssh_connection method\n\nThis method creates a secure ssh connection with our FTP server using the given credentials. On successful connection it sets the self.ssh_ok attribute to True and returns. Otherwise self.ssh_ok is set to False and returned.\n\none thing to notice in this method is the self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy( paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()). We configured it to set the missing host keys with a auto generated policy. If you\u2019re going to run this in AWS Glue as python shell job, instead of adding the auto add policy, use the host policies. For this, do the following in the code\n\n#self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())\n\n# in production, use load_system_host_keys\n\nself.ssh_client.load_system_host_keys()\n\ncreate_sftp_connection method\n\nThis method calls the create_ssh_connection method creates the ssh connection and then proceeds to open the SFTP connection. On successful connection it sets the self.sftp_ok to True and on failure sets it to False and returns the value.\n\ncreate_sftp_connection method\n\nmove_files_to_processed method\n\nThis method is called in the initiate_ingestion method after the file is successfully uploaded to s3. This method take the file name as argument. Sets the source and destination paths on the FTP server as src and dest, and then executes the following command which will move the file from the src path to the dest path.\n\ntry:\n\n_, _, _ = self.ssh_client.exec_command(\"mv \" + src+\" \" + dest) except Exception as error:\n\nprint(\"error moving files to processed directory, error: \", error)\n\nOur move_files_to_processed method is as follows:\n\nmove_files_to_processed method\n\ncreate_s3_partition method\n\nThis method creates the s3 partition structure. The partition consists of root directory name followed by year, month,day,hour. In this way we can have a time based partitioned data.\n\ncreate_s3_partition method\n\ns3_upload_file_multipart method\n\nThis method uploads the files to the specified s3 bucket. It uses the TransferConfig class to handle the multipart upload. We specify the configurations for TransferConfig as follows:\n\nconfig = TransferConfig(multipart_threshold=cfg.MULTIPART_THRESHOLD,\n\nmultipart_chunksize=cfg.MULTIPART_CHUNKSIZE,\n\nmax_concurrency=cfg.MAX_CONCURRENCY,\n\nuse_threads=cfg.USER_THREADS\n\n)\n\nthe multipart_threshold parameter determines the minimum size of file that should be after which the file will be uploaded via multipart. AWS recommends all files greater than 100MB be uploaded via multipart, so I have set this parameter to 100MB. This can be changed in the config.py file.\n\nparameter determines the minimum size of file that should be after which the file will be uploaded via multipart. AWS recommends all files greater than 100MB be uploaded via multipart, so I have set this parameter to 100MB. This can be changed in the config.py file. the multipart_chunksize parameter determines the size of each part during multipart upload. I have set it to 20MB.\n\nparameter determines the size of each part during multipart upload. I have set it to 20MB. the max_concurrency parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent S3 API transfer operations that should be used to upload each part. Default is 10.\n\nparameter determines the maximum number of concurrent S3 API transfer operations that should be used to upload each part. Default is 10. lastly the use_threads parameter determines whether transfer operations use threads to implement concurrency. Thread use can be disabled by setting the use_threads attribute to False. If thread use is disabled, transfer concurrency does not occur. Accordingly, the value of the max_concurrency attribute is ignored.\n\nWe pass this config object to our s3.upload_fileobj as parameter\n\nself.s3.upload_fileobj(source_file, self.s3_bucket_name,\n\ns3_target_file, Config=config)\n\nThe TransferConfig class automatically checks whether to upload the file as a single part or via multipart. It automatically handles the failed uploads and takes care of retries in case of failures.\n\ns3_upload_file_multipart method\n\ninitiate_ingestion method\n\nThis method initiates the calls to establish ssh and sftp connections. Changes FTP directory path to specified path where the files reside. Gets list of all the files in the FTP specified path and starts upload to s3. Files Successfully uploaded to S3 gets moved into the processed directory on FTP server. Once all files are uploaded closes all the connections.\n\nclose_connections method\n\nThis mehtod is used to close the ssh and sftp connections.\n\nUsing the code as AWS Glue Job\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the same implementation can be used in a managed environment such as AWS Glue. If user has files arriving on the FTP server at a certain time period (hour, day, month etc) he can schedule the job to run at a specific time to ingest all the files from the FTP server to s3.\n\nWe have to modify a few things in our code to be able to run this implementation as an AWS Glue Python shell job\n\nIn our imports section of python_glue_injestion_job.py file uncomment the following import. We are using easy install to install the paramiko module in the Glue Environment since it does not come with default Python installation.\n\ninstall_path = os.environ['GLUE_INSTALLATION'] easy_install.main( [\"--install-dir\", install_path, \"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ac/15/4351003352e11300b9f44 a13576bff52dcdc6e4a911129c07447bda0a358/paramiko-2.7.1.tar.gz\"] ) reload(site)\n\nin create_ssh_connection method comment following\n\n#self.ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())\n\nand uncomment the follwoing\n\nself.ssh_client.load_system_host_keys()\n\nwhat we are doing is instead of using an auto generated policy we are using the host keys of the environment we are in.\n\nAfter doing above steps we can run this code in as a Python shell job in AWS Glue.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this article, we looked at how can perform the data ingestion step of a Datalake pipeline. We learned how we can use the paramiko library to create a secure ssh SFTP connection with a FTP server and upload files from the server to our AWS S3 buckets. We also briefly looked at how we can use the given implementation in a managed environment such as AWS Glue.\n\nLink to my Github repository:",

        "title": "Only 49% of Americans Plan to Get Vaccinated Against COVID-19. Yes, You Should Be That Shocked",
        "text": "I am always fascinated by all the wonderful things people can create. Vaccines are one of those things. We have the ability to find ways to become immune to viruses without getting sick.\n\nBut sometimes, people can really disappoint me.\n\nA survey conducted by the AP-NORC Center in May 2020 showed that 49% of Americans plan to get vaccinated, 20% don\u2019t, and 31% are unsure.\n\nImage by apnorc.org\n\nOld people are more willing to get vaccinated than young people. It partly surprised me, because old people tend to be more skeptical in general. But it\u2019s also true that they are the ones who risk more lethal complications.\n\nWhite people are more will willing to get vaccinated than Blacks or Hispanics. I personally think that this has more to do with the economical status than with the race. Minorities have a lower average income than Whites in the US. They may be worried about the direct and indirect costs of vaccination. But it\u2019s just my personal hypothesis.\n\nDemocrats are more willing to get vaccinated than Republicans. It didn\u2019t really surprise me. As a liberal, I know I can be biased, and I know that there are very smart conservatives too, so don\u2019t take it personally. But the numbers speak for themselves here. Also, I was a bit surprised that Independents are the most unsure. Maybe, since they are very moderate in their political views, they tend to be very moderate in everything? Not that it\u2019s a bad thing.\n\nImage by apnorc.org\n\nThe reasons why one would get the vaccine are obvious. Protecting oneself, one\u2019s family, and the community are the most common ones. But I was really curious about the reasons one would not get the vaccine.\n\nImage by apnorc.org\n\nAll these reasons, except the allergy one, are very concerning. We will explore the top five in a moment.\n\nSimilar studies have been done everywhere. In Europe, the situation isn\u2019t much different. A similar poll has been conducted in Italy, where I live, and it shows similar results.\n\nImage by quotidianosanita.it\n\nIt translates to \u201cI am willing to get vaccinated if a vaccine against COVID-19 will be identified\u201d. The answers, left to right, are: \u201cabsolutely unlikely\u201d, \u201csomewhat unlikely\u201d, \u201cneither unlikely nor likely\u201d, \u201csomewhat likely\u201d, \u201cvery likely\u201d.\n\nIn the rest of this story, I will explore the reasons why people won\u2019t get vaccinated, while also analyzing the psychology behind them.\n\nIgnorance Is As Deadly As the Virus\n\nPhoto by Roman Kraft on Unsplash\n\nIt\u2019s not news that there is a lot of misinformation about vaccines. This is a major concern, to the point that the World Health Organization listed \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d as one of the 10 major global health threats. And it was in 2019, before COVID.\n\nWithout even talking about the made-up causality between vaccines and autism, which is a conspiracy theory held by a minority, there are other unfounded concerns held by a larger share of the population. Let\u2019s take another look at those shown by the poll:\n\n\u201cI would be concerned about side effects from the vaccine\u201d. Yes, vaccines have side effects and no vaccine is 100% safe. But these side effects are no worse or more frequent than any drug you normally take. A vaccine will be deployed only after it will be scientifically proven that the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n\u201cI would be concerned about getting infected with the coronavirus from the vaccine\u201d. That\u2019s the whole point! You get infected so that you build immunity, but with a virus that is weakened and unable to reproduce.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus\u201d. More on that later.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think vaccines work very well\u201d. It\u2019s true that most vaccines don\u2019t have a 100% efficacy rate. A new vaccine is needed for influenza every year. But what do you have to lose? Even if the vaccine won\u2019t work perfectly on you, it will probably still give you a partial immunity, and you would get less serious symptoms from an infection.\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak is not as serious as some people say it is\u201d. Are we still doing that? Coronavirus has already killed more than influenza normally does in a year without the lockdown. Coronavirus may be just like a bad flu for some people, but it\u2019s been proven that it\u2019s way more contagious.\n\nIt\u2019s so disheartening that scientists are working hard on a vaccine to end this global crisis, but their efforts can be rendered worthless by mere human ignorance.\n\nPeople Are Getting Bored with COVID, It\u2019s Not Frightening Anymore\n\nPhoto by Jade Masri on Unsplash\n\nAfter three months stuck at home, we got used to COVID. Now it\u2019s part of our normal life, and we don\u2019t care anymore.\n\nFear has diminished. Most countries have eased the lockdown and expect people to behave with common sense, adopting good habits like wearing masks. But people won\u2019t do something that is not mandatory if it\u2019s even a bit uncomfortable. It\u2019s too hot to wear masks now. Who cares?\n\nTake BLM protests, for example. I fully support the reasons behind these protests, but this was the worst timing possible. Furthermore, allow me to get a bit off-topic and share an unpopular opinion. It\u2019s not like they are going to fix anything. Racism in the US is too deep-rooted in the nation\u2019s history. Slavery in the past created a vicious circle in which racism and low opportunities for Blacks fed each other. Even after they were granted equal rights, Blacks got fewer chances to prove themselves and this further amplified racist views. Protests may alleviate some symptoms, but it will take much more to fix racism.\n\nFortunately, though, studies show that these protests didn\u2019t increase the spread of COVID. So, why am I saying all this? The point I want to make is how little people care about COVID now. Most people knew that these protests would have increased the spread, even if it didn\u2019t happen. But they didn\u2019t care.\n\nTo make matters worse, most people have started to think that COVID has gotten weaker with summer weather.\n\nThis is not true. A virus never \u201cgets weaker\u201d on its own. It can only get stronger. It\u2019s basic evolution.\n\nYes, the exponential spread has partially slowed down with the higher temperature. But this is only because, with hot weather, saliva drops evaporate faster, and the virus spreads with more difficulty. Yet the virus itself is the same as before.\n\nAfter the summer, the spread will accelerate again, and we will likely get a second wave. If anything, the virus can only get more contagious with the summer, to adapt to a more difficult environment. But this is just my hypothesis, and I\u2019m not a virologist, so I won\u2019t make further predictions.\n\nThis summer is the quiet before the storm. At least in Europe, things look good for now. In Italy, we are getting just 100\u2013200 new cases every day. But in the US, with its government\u2019s poor management, things look very, very bad. And people just don\u2019t care anymore.\n\nYour Actions Matter. Remember, It All Started With a Single Person\n\nPhoto by Morning Brew on Unsplash\n\nOne of the reasons why people wouldn\u2019t get vaccinated was the following: \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus\u201d.\n\nThis is either ignorant or just selfish. As we are required to wear masks to protect others, we should get vaccinated not only to protect ourselves, but also to avoid being potential carriers of the virus. In other words, if you don\u2019t get vaccinated, you may put several other people at risk.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the 2\u20133 people you can directly infect. Each of these people is another potential carrier that could infect another 2\u20133 people. This could grow exponentially and hundreds or thousands of people could get infected because you didn\u2019t get vaccinated (and neither did they). Remember, it all started with a single person.\n\nAs I\u2019m writing this, there are almost 11,500,000 confirmed cases, while the actual number is probably 5 or 10 times higher. All it took was just one person.\n\nSo, even if you don\u2019t care about getting sick, you should get vaccinated for your friends, family, and community. It can actually make a difference.\n\nAccording to estimates, 50 to 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.\n\nVaccination is an act of social responsibility. It\u2019s not enough to fight fake news about vaccines, people should also be made aware of the importance of vaccination as a duty towards others.\n\nThe virus itself is not the only challenge we are facing in this pandemic. The role of our opinions and decisions as responsible citizens poses a bigger challenge that will shape our future even beyond the pandemic.",

        "text": "Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash\n\nIt is very easy these days to find ourselves overcommitted and overwhelmed as we try to \u201cfit it all in.\u201d\n\nThere are many demands for our time and attention, pulling us in a thousand different directions, and countless distractions to derail us from what really matters.\n\nIt is all too common to find ourselves busy nonstop throughout the day without any space for real thinking. After all, when our lives are so hectic, isn\u2019t it an unrealistic luxury to set dedicated time aside for thinking and reflecting?\n\nThat is the default mindset for many, but author Greg McKeown provides an alternative viewpoint in his New York Times best-selling book, Essentialism (a fantastic book about doing less, but better, in all areas of our lives).\n\nHe says,\u201cThe faster and busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedule. And the noisier things get, the more we need to build quiet reflection spaces in which we can truly focus.\u201d\n\nMcKeown cites Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, who schedules up to two hours of uninterrupted time on his calendar every day.\n\nWeiner started this practice when back-to-back meetings began consuming his schedule. Initially, blocking out blank space felt like an indulgence, but now he credits it with being his single-most important productivity tool.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos follows a similar model. He has been known to keep two days per week unstructured in order to think, generate new ideas, and take a long-term perspective instead of getting buried in the day-to-day.\n\nAnother example is Bill Gates who has habitually taken a week off (twice a year) simply to read and to think. Just in case this only seems possible for Gates at this stage in his career, it turns out that his \u201cThink Week\u201d ritual dates back to the early 1980s and has been maintained during even the most stressful business times at Microsoft and his foundation.\n\nAs McKeown says, \u201cNo matter how busy you think you are, you can carve time and space to think out of your workday.\u201d\n\nMaybe it could be first thing in the morning instead of checking email, or in the afternoon as an alternative to social media.\n\nWhether it is two hours per day, two days per week, or two weeks per year, we need to make it a point to block out time specifically to think.\n\nThis space is vital in order to prioritize our life and work, and to focus our energy in the most meaningful areas.\n\nBut it will only happen if we deliberately design it into our calendar.",

        "title": "A Goodbye to Golden Muzzles: Internal Dissent and the Cautionary Tale of Facebook",
        "text": "In 2019, former CIA agent Yael Eisenstat was specifically hired by Facebook to help reform how the company works with political disinformation and politic ads that contain lies. She quickly bounced out, outraged at Facebook\u2019s inability to take a sober look in the mirror. In short order, she became a vocal critic.\n\nYael sees reforming Facebook as the best and most viable path forward. The social media platform has fended off or absorbed dozens of would-be competitors in the last decade and grown to become a media empire. Facebook\u2019s network effects, reaching more than 2 billion people and counting, are unassailable. The company is a source of American pride and the projection of soft power. But it has also proven an Achilles heel for American democracy, vulnerable to Russia, China and other actors who have fractured and divided us, sewn discord and unrest, successfully diminishing America\u2019s standing in the world. Some would now argue Facebook and other social media to a lesser degree, have been the drivers pushing America to the brink of a new civil war.\n\nThough Zuckerberg himself engages weekly with Facebook employees, in AMA sessions where dissent is ostensibly encouraged, he did not alter the company\u2019s content policies until his own personal wealth saw a $7B hit, as share price fell due to the ad boycott. Money talks, apparently. For Zuckerberg, it may be the only voice he listens to.\n\nPrivately, many people I\u2019ve spoken with in technology, or who cover technology for major news outlets are skeptical as well of the recent Facebook oversight board. Off the record several have characterized this move as a pre-emptive attempt at self-regulation to stave off any government oversight, oversight that might have teeth and impose real sanctions for hate speech or lies that have serious criminal or geo-political impacts.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is true myself. It would be commendable if an oversight committee had real independence, a group that could not be overruled by Zuckerberg on a whim and could make binding choices that might even result in less revenues but greater civic responsibility. If recent experience is any teacher, such choices would likely never be approved by Zuckerberg. It\u2019s probably true that this will only happen in a substantive way through legislation from Congress.\n\n\n\nAt present I\u2019m in the minority of my friends who are still using the platform. Those of us who have not yet abandoned Facebook are there because of all the ways we can connect with people we love, admire or miss around the world, data harvesting be damned. The platform does provide connection and opportunity.\n\nI\u2019ve done all I can to moderate my own feed towards civil discourse, learning, discovery and debate in a spirit of mutual respect. We try to eschew the outrage that sadly has become the norm for grabbing and retaining people\u2019s attention. But I also am under no illusion that my choices are minimal and that Facebook\u2019s opaque algorithm is in charge of what I see and read and who sees and reads what I offer there.\n\nI do not control my bubble. They do, and they adjust it to fit their advertisers, to maximize their own revenue and to maximize the usefulness of my data in order to sell it. If you\u2019d like to read more on how we\u2019re all uncompensated \u201cdata wells,\u201d I\u2019d recommend Tristan Harris\u2019 Center for Humane Technology or Douglas Rushkoff\u2019s Team Human.\n\nOne of the best things that could happen to check Facebook\u2019s unrestrained power would be a digital data rights piece of legislation such as that proposed by Andrew Yang\u2019s Humanity Forward organization. If people were paid for their data and could collectively bargain for how it is used, we might get to retain Facebook\u2019s benefits without the company racking up more moral failures and more unchecked power. I personally don\u2019t see how this could operate without a self-sovereign digital identity, a one true encrypted version of each of us online, to which rights, protections and responsibilities could accrue, just as they do in the physical world. In fact this is still a project I hope to work on in the future.\n\nSo, what would Facebook be like now, if dissent had been genuinely valued, in such a way that it resulted in real flexibility on issues like limits on freedom of speech?\n\nAnd what can startups in their infancy, but with Facebook-scale ambitions, learn from turning internal dissent into an advantage for the organization? How might dissent be an engine for positive civil impact as economic milestones are achieved?\n\nThe Advantages of Dissent\n\nGiven the incentives and rules of the shareholder economy, most companies today operate a bit like a constitutional monarchy, with a parliamentary function embodied by a board and shareholders, meant to keep executives (the monarchs) in check. Oversight is meant to prevent abuses or harms that might affect the bottom line, or potentially generate negative legal repercussions. These tend to be cold and unfeeling calculations.\n\nThere is no real oversight beyond this dynamic for moral hazard \u2014 we haven\u2019t yet built that into how our economies operate.\n\nThere are more cases than warrant cataloguing for greed overriding principle in the behavior of corporate leaders. In fact it\u2019s common that CSR and philanthropic initiatives operate to whitewash ill-gotten gains. If you want a fascinating at length expos\u00e9, consider Anand Giridharadas\u2019 book Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.\n\nAnd if you believe as I do, that the majority of power in our world is currently operative in the corporate sphere, then you may also agree that we as a global culture have politically devolved. In the last 500 years, we\u2019ve moved from feudalism to democracy to corporate feudalism as the dominant forms of power shaping our lives today.\n\nHow might we bring more democratic principles into corporations?\n\n\n\nSome companies have experimented with structures such as Holocracy, or what Noam Chomsky once referred to as \u201canarcho-syndicalist communities,\u201d typified by Burning Man. The hope here was to flatten hierarchies and create dynamic self-directed teams to produce products, solve problems and achieve deliverables, whether shipping shoes or building theme camps or art cars. Once achieved, the team could dissolve and join new teams in a constantly evolving fashion that would render the traditional org chart obsolete and provide the intrinsic fulfillment of novel initiatives for all involved. These attempts were most famously piloted by Zappos and its CEO Tony Hsieh. Amongst the tech community and written about here in the NY Times, these experiments are now mostly considered to be failures, not producing greater employee satisfaction or superior outcomes.\n\nBut this was just one experiment.\n\nIf we are going to evolve the ways companies function and perhaps infuse them with more democratic processes, we\u2019ll need to experiment a lot more than this. There\u2019s a near infinite number of possibilities for democratizing internal operations as well as public access to internal decision making and overall accountability.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll need to look at how open dialogue can be turned to competitive advantage. Less dramatic experiments with more egalitarian decision making and structure have been trialed at Patagonia and at REI and other co-ops throughout the world.\n\nAnd the promised land may include some element of Pixar, but with a more inventive governance structure. Pixar famously enshrined psychological safety and creativity generating rituals into its company in robust ways that have proven resilient, even after it was acquired by Disney. A great place to read about how this was done is in Ed Catmull\u2019s recent book, Creativity Inc.. Pixar broke down the slide towards rigidity, politics and career enough at least to ensure that the studio did not forever attempt to repeat its most profitable films and instead pushed for continuous reinvention and originality of storylines. Dissent is architected into Pixar\u2019s daily operations.\n\nSo how might we move away from monarchy and towards democratic principles? How could such principles become an advantage for your startup? And what does this have to do with constructive conflict?\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s come to light for me recently is the promise of collective intelligence, collective and complementary veins of creativity and problem solving. These are ideas at the forefront of social science and most of them have not really been fully applied in the context of commercial companies.\n\nTo fully benefit from complementary intelligence and talent you need to solicit the recurrent and safe voice of dissent. We need to think together. In the words of Laurie Mulvey, Director of World in Conversation, \u201cconflict doesn\u2019t have to be a dirty word.\u201d You need robust trust and real disagreement, without people succumbing to \u201camygdala hijack,\u201d a full blown attack of anger, because someone feels personally threatened.\n\n\n\nFor trust to blossom and unvarnished dissent to surface consistently, using Safi Bahcall\u2019s metaphor, a garden must be tended.\n\nLarger work cultures tend to cultivate battlefields more than gardens. They teach insecurity, scarcity, avoidance of risk, minimal agency, a war mindset, a zero sum game, with commands trickling down from the top of a pyramidal org chart. The norm is to focus on politics and career advancement. At least in America, most employees can be laid off without notice. If you speak up and become a pain in the ass, the possibility of being fired and to some degree blacklisted in an industry is real. When you\u2019re out there hiring, this sort of conditioning is brought into your startup by most employees, no matter what your company may screen for. It\u2019s a reasonable expectation within the job marketplace as it is. People play defense and zip their lips.\n\nTo remove the muzzles, golden or otherwise, and benefit from collective intelligence requires repetition from leadership. It requires the cultivation of a symbiotic garden wherein all elements flourish. Leaders will need to repeat that substantive moral dissent is welcome, moral questioning is welcome, to produce this kind of candor. This requires emotionally secure and wise leaders.\n\nAnd though it may feel too dangerous, dissent that is visible outside of the company is not necessarily a disadvantage. A growing body of research suggests that leaders willing to express vulnerability and fallibility are far more sympathetic and credible.\n\nWorking With Dissent and Cultivating Collective Intelligence\n\nSo in conclusion for you startup founders, how might your company benefit from the collective intelligence of your founding team?\n\nAnd how might you build a culture and company with enshrined rituals to benefit from dissent, from diversity of opinions that will allow you to remain flexible and adaptive as context changes and your company\u2019s impact grows?\n\nHere are a few suggestions.\n\nPractice constructive conflict. Model and repeat that the culture you\u2019re all building together is not a monarchy, that collective wrestling with tactics and with moral issues implied by the company\u2019s activity is welcome, always. Schedule for AMAs and close the loop by telling your colleagues when their dissent or differing perspective shaped or reshaped any small or large part of the company\u2019s operations.\n\nModel and repeat that the culture you\u2019re all building together is not a monarchy, that collective wrestling with tactics and with moral issues implied by the company\u2019s activity is welcome, always. Schedule for AMAs and close the loop by telling your colleagues when their dissent or differing perspective shaped or reshaped any small or large part of the company\u2019s operations. Be a good gardener, not a military general. Devolve decision making to others as much as possible and repeat that you trust them, admire them and care deeply about their success. Call attention to their greater expertise and defer to their decisions especially when you initially disagreed with their proposals.\n\nDevolve decision making to others as much as possible and repeat that you trust them, admire them and care deeply about their success. Call attention to their greater expertise and defer to their decisions especially when you initially disagreed with their proposals. Do the dangerous and hard thing. Develop a communications strategy that demonstrates to your customers and the public that you\u2019re a fallible, humble, learning organization, not a uniform and obedient phalanx of soldiers gulping Kool-Aid without question. Companies that treat their work like war are increasingly mistrusted. Be relatable and human and watch public respect for what you accomplish rise. Speak from integrity, follow through and own mistakes.\n\nDevelop a communications strategy that demonstrates to your customers and the public that you\u2019re a fallible, humble, learning organization, not a uniform and obedient phalanx of soldiers gulping Kool-Aid without question.

Remember that Adam Smith, arguably the father of economics, was actually a moral philosopher.\n\nContinuously realign extrinsic rewards with ethical behaviors, even whistleblowing.

I think this is best addressed by hallowed pundit, author and syncretic thinker Malcolm Gladwell. In this short video from the BBC, he addresses social conditioning, ethnicity and bias in who is allowed to add friction and who is discouraged from doing so, all good things to be aware of if you truly want to encourage constructive dissent in your company from all voices and corners.",

        "text": "Reading, writing and displaying images\n\nBefore we can do anything with computer vision, we need to be able to read and understand how images are processed by computers. The only information computers can process is binary information (0 and 1), this includes text, images, and video.\n\nHow do computers work with images\n\nTo understand how a computer \u201cunderstands\u201d an image yo can picture a matrix of the size of the image where on each cell you assign a value that represents the color of the image in that position.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example with an image in greyscale:\n\nFor this particular case, we can assign each block (or pixel) in the image a numeric value (which can be interpreted as binary). This numeric value can be from any range, though it\u2019s a convention to use 0 for black, 255 for white, and all the integers in between to represent the intensity.\n\nWhen we work with color images, things can get a bit different depending on the library and how we choose to represent the colors. We will talk more about that later in the post, however, they all share more or less the same idea, which is using different channels to represent the colors, being RGB (red, green, and blue) one of the most popular options. With RGB we need 3 channels to build each pixel, so our 2d matrix now is a 3d matrix with a depth of 3, where each channel is the intensity of a particular color, and when mixing we get the final color for the pixel.\n\nWorking with images using OpenCV\n\nLet\u2019s now jump into the code to perform 3 of the most important functions when dealing with images, reading, showing, and saving.\n\nimport cv2\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Reading the image\n\nimage = cv2.imread('sample1.jpg') # Showing the image\n\nplt.imshow(image)\n\nplt.show() # Saving the image\n\ncv2.imwrite('sample1_output.jpg', image)\n\nIf you run our code, now you will get one image saved to disk, and another as a result of the plot.\n\nImage by author, from original image by Berkay Gumustekin on Unsplash\n\nThe image on the left is the one we plotted, vs the one on the right which is the image saved to disk. The difference in sizes aside (due to the plot), the image on the left side looks weird, looks bluish, but why is it different? (by the way, the image on the right is correct).",

        "title": "How Writing 1000 Words a Day Changed my Life",
        "text": "I wrote at least a thousand words a day every day from the age of twelve on. \u2014 Ray Bradbury, Zen and the Art of Writing\n\nWhen I interviewed Julien Smith for the first time in 2012, he had one of the most popular blogs on the internet. Of all the things he shared with me in our conversation, one thing he said stood out to me. I write 1000 words every day.\n\nShortly after that conversation I started writing 1000 words a day and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing ever since. To say that the habit changed my life would be an understatement.\n\nIt\u2019s served as a form of meditation, therapy, and clarity.\n\nIt led to a 2 book deal with a publisher and helped me to launch a career as an author and speaker\n\nIt\u2019s enabled me to finish a 45,000 word manuscript in 6 months and write 100\u2019s of articles.\n\nThis simple daily habit has literally had a six figure ROI. It\u2019s changed my life and my career.\n\n1. A Habit Born out of Necessity\n\nWhat started first out of curiosity, eventually turned into something that I had to do out of necessity. The demands on my production increased dramatically almost overnight.\n\nI was writing 2\u20133 posts a week for my personal blog in addition to a weekly newsletter\n\nI was being paid $1000 a month to write one piece a week for a client\n\nI was writing a weekly piece for a blog at a startup that I owned a small equity stake in.\n\nIn order to keep up with the demand, I had to develop a system.\n\nIf I waited to be inspired I would be screwed\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before, systems are essential to increasing your creative output. 1000 words a day became my system. Within a few months it was a habit so deeply ingrained into my life that it was like brushing my teeth. And that\u2019s when things started to get really interesting.\n\n2. The Art of Being Unmistakable\n\nAs part of my 1000 words I would publish a really long Facebook status update, what I jokingly referred to as committing career suicide one status update at a time. After a few months my writing started resonating with people like it never had before. In September of 2013, I compiled all of my Facebook status updates into a google doc, had it edited, had Mars Dorian design a book cover, uploaded it to Amazon and called it the Art of Being Unmistakable.\n\nThe first week it sold 300 copies and I considered that a success. But about three weeks later, a media circus erupted. When I check the rankings on Amazon, I noticed that my book was #1 in the entrepreneurship category. When I tweeted about it, somebody said \u201cyou might want to thank Glenn Beck. He raved about your book on his show today.\u201d When I asked a friend she said \u201cI don\u2019t think you realize how big a deal this is, check your sales.\u201d When I logged into the Amazon dashboard, I noticed that the book had sold 1000 copies in a day. Shortly after that I ended up being on the Glenn Beck show and my self published book became a Wall Street Journal Best Seller.\n\n3. A 2-Book Deal with a Publisher\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, I never stopped writing 1000 words a day. A few months into 2015, I got the following email from an editor at Penguin Portfolio.\n\nI recently rejoined publishing after working at online education startups, having just left Skillshare to join the Penguin Random House team. While it might seem counterintuitive, I came back just for this specific division that works and thinks differently than most of the industry \u2014 and is setting out to help entrepreneurs and changemakers with the stories, experiences, and motivation of people who have successfully forged their own path, people like Seth Godin, Guy Kawasaki, Ryan Holiday, Nir Eyal, Nick Bilton, and more. You are one of those people, and are top of my list of who to contact to work on a book together.\n\nWriting in many ways is like planting seeds. You plant seeds today for the person you eventually want to become. After a few conversations, my daily writing habit resulted in a 2 book deal. The first book Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best was released on August 2, 2016. And I\u2019m currently working on my second book.\n\nSo how exactly do you incorporate this habit into your life?\n\n4. Design an Environment Conducive to Writing\n\nYou have to design an environment that\u2019s conducive to the person you want to become. If you want to become a writer, your environment should reflect that. If you came to my apartment you would notice two things:\n\n1) I read a lot of books\n\n2) I have stacks of Moleskine notebooks\n\nIt\u2019s likely that you\u2019d notice something similar in the environment of anybody else who is a writer. When I ate dinner at Tucker Max\u2019s house for the first time, the first thing that caught my attention was the sheer number of books he had. In Ryan Holiday\u2019s post about maintaining a physical library you\u2019ll see that he has multiple bookshelves that are filled from floor to ceiling.\n\n5. Activation Energy and Success Accelerants\n\nIn his book The Happiness Advantage, the author Shawn Achor talks about how reducing the amount of energy it takes to do something increases the likelihood you\u2019ll do it. Something as simple as decreasing the number of mouse clicks to do something will increase your odds of doing it.\n\nThe simple hack for this is using a distraction free writing tool like Macjournal. Set it up the night before, so when you flip open your laptop in the morning, it\u2019s the first thing you see. Then you just write. If you prefer to write with a paper notebook, put it out with a pen the night before. The simple act of putting your notebook out the night before with a pen increases the likelihood that you\u2019ll actually follow through on writing.\n\nAnother variation of this hack is to write one sentence the night before, ideally right before you go to sleep. Write down somebody else\u2019s words. Suddenly the page appears less daunting. This is one of the many reasons I always read before I write. Since your brain makes progress towards a goal based on how close it thinks it is towards that goal, starting with a quote allows you tap into the power of success accelerants.\n\n6. Be Prolific\n\n\u201cAll good writing begins with terrible first efforts\u201d \u2014 Anne Lammot\n\nIt\u2019s likely your early writing efforts will be lousy. Don\u2019t be afraid to write a shitty first sentence. To this day only a small amount of what I produce on a daily basis is actually usable. But when you write 7000 words a week, you don\u2019t need much to be useable. Say you write 1000 words a week that are decent. That\u2019s 52,000 words. That\u2019s one book in a year. Your cumulative output matters more than any individual writing day. If you want to become a better writer, start by becoming a prolific one.\n\n7. Don\u2019t Judge Your Work\n\nIt\u2019s possible during the course of 90 minutes of writing that you\u2019ll wander. This happens to me all the time. I\u2019ll get 3\u20134 paragraphs into a train of thought and suddenly I\u2019m writing stream of consciousness psychobabble. At this point your natural temptation will be to give up or give into a source of distraction. But if you can resist this temptation and just let the verbal vomit show up on the page, you\u2019ll get back to a place of making sense. In that sense it\u2019s a bit like meditation. You simply observe the wandering mind and return to focusing on your breath.\n\n8. Make it a Habit\n\nInspiration is an unreliable strategy for creative work. The muse is a fickle mistress and she tends to show up on her own schedule. You on the other hand have the option to show up every day. By showing up every day, you tap into the profound power of consistency. Something that starts as an item on your to do list eventually becomes a habit and you start to build momentum.\n\nOn a related note- if you struggle with habits, I\u2019ve put a guide together on optimizing productivity & creativity. Sign up for my newsletter here and you\u2019ll receive it shortly.\n\n9. Always Carry a Notebook\n\nInspiration has a funny way of striking at unusual times. Usually you\u2019re not in front of the computer when this happens. A habit I picked up from my friend AJ Leon is to always carry a notebook. A notebook is like fertile soil where you can plant seeds for your creative ideas.\n\n10. Learn to Recognize Patterns\n\nIf you pay attention to how you work, you\u2019ll start to see patterns. These patterns are incredibly useful in helping you to develop systems and mental models for you to get your work done. They give you a personal operating manual for yourself. Recognizing patterns helps you adjust your behavior to reach optimal levels of performance.\n\nA pattern I saw in my life was that waking up before 6am and meditating led to deeper levels of flow and focus. I also knew that after 10am things seemed to go downhill and after 1pm I\u2019m essentially worthless.\n\nI tend to experience flow most consistently when I give myself 90 minutes of uninterrupted creation time.\n\nIf I go more than a few days without sweating or exercising, my depression and anxiety tend to be exacerbated.\n\nI saw that text messages that weren\u2019t responded to after I sent a text were causing me anxiety. I turned of all notifications after this.\n\nThese patterns play themselves out throughout our lives. Not just in our work. They occur in nearly every situation. You might notice something as simple as a phrase in an email that always elicits a positive response. If that\u2019s the case it makes no sense to deviate from that pattern.\n\nYou might think that adjusting to patterns might make your life repetitive and boring, but the opposite seems to be true. The beauty of recognizing patterns in your life is that it frees up your cognitive bandwidth for much higher value activities than trying to decide how you plan to behave for the day. Recognizing patterns in your life requires you to take actually take time, slow down and reflect on the results that your behavior is producing.\n\nUnderstanding your own behavioral patterns and the results they produce is the closest thing to a \u201csuccess\u201d pill you could find.\n\nIf x causes y, then it would make sense that you choose the x that causes the y that you want. As you recognize patterns you\u2019ll begin not only work more efficiently but work more effectively. By utilizing the patterns you recognize to develop processes and systems, you free your mind up to think creatively. If your mind is taxed with decisions like how long and how much you\u2019re depleting your willpower.\n\nOne of the most valuable sections of the BestSelf journal is Lessons learned for the day. We learn tons of lessons every day, but without the discipline to capture them, it\u2019s no better than if we didn\u2019t learn them at all. In fact this idea of patterns was inspired by a lesson I learned yesterday which was that 90 minutes of deep work was my consistent sweet spot. Once I saw that pattern I started looking for other ones. As you recognize patterns in your life, you\u2019ll go from a frenetic scatterbrained pace to one that is fast paced, focused, sustainable and generates momentum.\n\nThere\u2019s a point at which any habit you adopt eventually becomes a part of who you are. You no longer have to think about it. It\u2019s what James Clear refers to as an identity based habit If you see in me in a coffeeshop, at a conference, or anywhere else before 8am, it\u2019s more than likely you\u2019ll find me writing 1000 words. This is no longer something I just do. It\u2019s who I am. In order for a habit to truly change your life, it has to become a practice, likely one that is lifelong.",

        "title": "Anorexia Has A Bacterial Origin, Researchers Say",
        "text": "Infection | Brain\n\nAnorexia Has A Bacterial Origin, Researchers Say\n\nIt\u2019s too naive to think anorexia arises from psychosocial factors alone, researchers argue.\n\nImage by CoxinhaFotos from Pixabay\n\nSitting at the 3rd most common disease affecting adolescent females, anorexia is characterized by severe calorie restriction \u2014 comorbid with anxiety and depression \u2014 that lead to the starvation and malfunctioning of many other organs. Anorexia is titled the most fatal mental illness.\n\nAnorexia Etiology Revisited\n\n\u201cPsychological factors might be important but are unconvincing as the primary or major cause [of anorexia],\u201d James Morris and colleague from Lancaster University, UK, wrote in Medical Hypothesis in 2016.\n\nAnorexia is a functional or psychosomatic disease; psycho means mind and somatic means body. It\u2019s a mind-body disease caused by a combination of psychological and physical factors.\n\nModern views of anorexia, however, neglect the physical cause of the disease, as Morris and team argued:\n\nThere might, for instance, be an increased incidence of physical and sexual abuse in childhood in those who go on to manifest functional disorders. It is easy to see how this could influence symptoms in adults but it stretches credulity to imagine abuse as the sole and sufficient cause of the functional disorder. Equally modern concepts of the perfect physical form promoted by the fashion industry will influence teenagers to diet but surely there must be something more profound and fundamental to induce emaciation and death by starvation or suicide.\n\nBasically, Morris et al. question the idea of psychosocial factors being the sole cause of anorexia. It\u2019s too simplistic and cr\u00e9dule, they thought.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t explain why a subset of adolescents do not develop anorexia when they have been exposed to similar childhood and cultural experiences.\n\nMany will quickly attribute this to differences in genetics, social support or individual\u2019s innate resilience. While these may also contribute to the overall likelihood of developing anorexia, Morris et al. asked:\n\nWhat if bacteria also play a role?\n\nWhen Bacteria-Fighting Antibodies Attack the Brain\n\nMorris et al. first observed that anorexia nervosa is 10x more prevalent in females than males, and so are autoimmune diseases.\n\nThey then cited several studies that found the presence of autoantibodies \u2014 that attack the serotonin neurons and appetite-regulating hormones/peptides\u2014 roaming in the blood and hypothalamus of anorexics. The levels of these autoantibodies also correlated with the severity of the eating disorder.\n\nThe hypothalamus is a brain region that controls human's basic needs such as sleep, body temperature, thirst, and appetite. It\u2019s also part of the limbic system \u2014 also called the reptilian brain \u2014 which is an ancient set of structures in the brain that governs instincts and emotions.\n\nWhere did these auto-antibodies come from? The studies that discovered them raised the possibility of bacterial infection(s). Upon encountering foreign entities, the immune system makes antibodies that bind to the bacteria surface \u2014 to neutralize or marked it for destruction by other immune cells.\n\nIf the bacterium shares a similar structure to some of the host\u2019s proteins \u2014 a phenomenon called molecular mimicry \u2014 the antibodies will target both the bacteria and the host own proteins.\n\nThe fact that these antibodies \u2014 now autoantibodies \u2014 are considered as allies makes things worse. The blood-brain-barrier, for example, doesn\u2019t see it as a threat \u2014 enabling these autoantibodies to easily enter the brain\u2019s limbic system.\n\n\u201cAuto-antibodies acting on the [brain\u2019s] limbic system could induce extremes of emotion including disgust and fear,\u201d Morris et al. wrote. \u201cThese then become linked, in the minds of adolescent girls, to culturally determined ideas of what is, and what is not, the ideal body shape and size.\n\nIt is then a small step for disgust and fear to be directed to food and obesity which the fashion industry currently demonises.\u201d\n\nLinking to Gut Dysbiosis\n\nWhile Morris et al. have not pinpointed a specific bacterial agent, current scientific evidence suggests that it could be gut bacteria.\n\nSergue\u00ef Fetissov, MD and Professor of Physiology, and colleagues from Rouen University and Hospital in France published a pioneer finding in this regard \u2014 which Morris et al. cited in his Medical Hypothesis paper.\n\nFetissov and team found that autoantibodies \u2014 attacking appetite-regulating peptides \u2014 in the bloodstream of anorexics have substantial sequence similarities to few known gut microbes and external pathogens.\n\nProteins having a similar string of amino acid sequence likely have similar structures. And similar structures indicate a higher chance of getting bound by the same antibody due to molecular mimicry.\n\n\u201cNumerous cases of sequence homology with these [appetite-regulating] peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli, Bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Candida species,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThese are just some examples as they have also discovered 20 other such microbes that have similar protein sequences as the human appetite-regulating peptides. The team further showed that mice without a gut microbiome have lower levels of such autoantibodies than normal mice.\n\n\u201cOur data demonstrate multiple cases of molecular mimicry of regulatory peptides with microbial proteins, identifying micro-organisms as putative biological targets to be tested for their relevance to the normal or pathophysiologic mechanisms of appetite and emotion,\u201d Fetissov et al. continued.\n\nLinking to the Gut-Brain Axis\n\nA 2019 review \u2014 written by Jochen Seitz, MD, and coordinator of eating disorders research at University Aachen and colleagues from Germany \u2014 took a more holistic approach to the bacterial implications of anorexia.\n\nThey look at the gut-brain axis and its associated immunology as a whole. They look at it as intricate biological machinery or systems that interact with one another (see figure below).\n\nWhile providing evidence supporting that bacterial infection may confuse the immune system to make antibodies attacking the brain\u2019s appetite-regulatory signals, they added more recent evidence on the gut microbiome profile of anorexics. Compared to non-anorexics, their gut showed a reduced microbial diversity and abnormal outgrowth of certain microbes.\n\n\u201cThese digestive products of [microbial] protein fermentation [in anorexics] were previously found to increase PYY-production, a gastric peptide known to decrease appetite and increase depressive symptoms,\u201d the German researchers wrote.\n\nImage credit: Open-access publication. Caption: Gut microbiome interactions in patients with AN. Citation: Seitz et al. (2019). The Impact of Starvation on the Microbiome and Gut-Brain Interaction in Anorexia Nervosa. Frontiers in Endocrinology, 10(41). doi: 10.3389/fendo.2019.00041\n\nTo Wrap It Up\n\nA gut dysbiosis or dysregulated gut-brain axis leads to systemic inflammation, autoantibodies, and harmful microbial metabolites \u2014 all of which negatively affect the brain\u2019s appetite signals.\n\nThis may trigger \u2014 or at least contribute to \u2014 the downward spiral leading to anorexia, in addition to genetic and psychosocial factors. To this end, Seitz et al. (2019) proposed for gut microbiome interventions in addition to traditional therapy for anorexia.\n\n\u201cThe goals could be to increase the amount of energy harvested from the same quantity of food and to decrease gut permeability, inflammation and antibody formation, with the potential consequence of reducing depressive and anxious symptoms,\u201d Seitz and colleagues emphasized.\n\nLikewise, Andrew Radford, the Chief Executive of Beat, an eating disorder charity told The Telegraph:",

You will create a science fiction story using this prompt.\n\nPlease follow the steps below and try to quickly respond to each question. You might use quick bullet points. Keep writing and keep it flowing. Enjoy!\n\nDescribe the starship. What is its name? Technical or technological features? Imagine its advanced technology. Imagine futurist technologies of the day. Implications? How are they traveling? Why is this starship leaving the Earth? Think of the reason(s) and the back story. Initiate the story: What are the events that trigger this starship to leave the Earth? Think of the mission of this starship. Where are they going? Why? What is their mission? What are the obstacles and challenges facing crew members? Think about these 12 characters/crew members. Who are they? Where do they come from? What makes them tick? Any pains? Are they haunted by their past? What about their personality? Any hidden agendas? Any special talents or super-powers? Ego issues? Vulnerabilities? Who are the biggest adversaries/enemies? What are their plans? How will they act? How do they pose a threat? Describe the events that lead to tensions/conflict. How do these events unfold? What is at stake? How do our heroes act? How do they deal with these threats/challenges? How do they transcend the obstacles? How do they transcend themselves? How do they face the darkness in themselves or in their enemies? How do they fall into darkness/traps/obstacles? How do they overcome these? Any conflicts or trust issues among crew members? How and why? How do they resolve these issues and solve the problems? Think of a few cliffhangers and a finale that will satisfy your readers or viewers.\n\nDo not judge your ideas and keep your ideas flowing.\n\nFollowing these steps and writing down your ideas quickly will help you get started in worldbuilding, screenwriting, and storytelling.\n\nWe did this exercise in the class that I taught recently. You can find the video of this workshop below. You can go to minute 1.50 to find this futurist screenwriting and storytelling exercise.\n\nWorkshop on Storytelling and Worldbuilding\n\nI designed this workshop as collective performance art, where we reviewed some of the biggest names in the landscapes of entertainment, creativity, and business. From space to magic, from basketball to fashion, from animation to computer games, from film music to architecture we have had a trans-disciplinary tour of storytelling and creative careers.",

Instead of writing about what\u2019s in it for my audience, I write more \u201cHow to Survive if Your Life is Shit\u201d pieces. Good-looking self-help gurus are much more marketable than the steaming pile of dooky that has been me and my life for 52 years.\n\nI know I\u2019m not where I want to be on Medium because I cannot fully embrace the listicle or the \u201c10 Quotes from Elon Musk that will Make You A Better Writer\u201d post.\n\nIt\u2019s just not me, and even though I have \u201cmaking money\u201d as my number one reason for blogging, I can\u2019t force myself to write clickbait headlines and vanilla pudding content.\n\nBecause the fact is that most times, I have to force myself to sit down and write, and I can\u2019t push myself to write junk I don\u2019t believe in.\n\nYou have to understand what is going on in my mind right now:\n\nVoices are screaming at the top of their lungs, back and forth to each other, and the topic is me and what a shit writer I am. The voices are spouting the ugliest and most hateful things about me and my failure to do anything with my life.

He knows I have to be tough on him and not let him fall victim to the crap going on behind him. As exhausted as he is from putting up with the racket 24 hours a day, I still have to be firm with him so that I can write.\n\nHe wants to be comfortable and only write when inspired or in the mood. But I know him. If I wait until he is in the perfect mindset to create, I will be waiting forever, and my life will stagnate.\n\nSo I encourage and even raise my voice, even though I know he is doing his best.

        "title": "It\u2019s Now or Never for a Green New Deal",
        "text": "Some sports fans will remember Doug Flutie\u2019s epic Hail Mary throw in the final seconds of the Orange Bowl in 1984. The throw was an act of desperation as there were only 6 seconds left at the beginning of the play, and a field goal was not an option as Boston College was down by 4 points. Flutie called the \u201c55 Flood Tip\u201d play, which sent three receivers straight down the field in the hopes that if one didn\u2019t get a clean catch, another receiver might tip ball in their favor. This is of course not a perfect metaphor for our current climate situation, but the notion of a Hail Mary play should resonate with an American audience.\n\nAs a society, we only have a small set of options moving forward in the context of climate change. The first option is to do nothing. That would be the equivalent of Doug Flutie taking a knee without even attempting to move the ball forward. The second option is to solely invest in climate adaptation, and effectively forfeit against the challenge of addressing climate change. This option would be the equivalent of Doug Flutie calling a run play in the final seconds of the game, essentially accepting the loss, but finishing out the game respectfully. The third and most exciting option is to throw our Hail Mary. This is the Green New Deal. A set of truly massive federally funded programs that drive our carbon emissions to net zero.\n\nThe phrase \u2018massive federally funded programs\u2019 is undoubtedly politically contentious as progressives and liberals will celebrate these new programs and fiscal conservatives will cringe at the thought of more taxes, more debt, more spending, and more government. Unfortunately, the reality of climate change is uncomfortable and requires our attention, our time, our dollars, and that of future generations as well. The planet is ours to maintain, and it isn\u2019t cheap. There is of course a lot to be done by individuals, local governments, state governments, corporations, and non-governmental organizations. But, we have a time constraint that necessitates federal involvement in a big way.\n\nWhen we refer to Green New Deal programs, we shouldn\u2019t think of them as a single piece of legislation or a single bill being advocated for by one Congresswoman. We need to think about Green New Deal programs as a myriad of initiatives that will continue until we reach a steady-state net zero emission economy. This means that over the next 30\u201350 years, we are going to develop countless programs and initiatives designed to address climate change and reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. And then, after we achieve a net zero carbon footprint economy, we will have to maintain it. So, this means that many of these programs and initiatives will exist forever, and even more will have to be created for the specific purpose of maintaining the promise of a sustainable future.\n\nGiven the results of the 2020 Presidential Election in the United States, it is time for Americans to rally behind a Green New Deal\u2026 forever.\n\nIt is conceivable that the political pendulum in the United States will continue to swing back and forth, which means in 4 to 8 years, America might vote in a fiscal conservative that de-prioritizes addressing climate change. If that is a possible future, then it makes even more sense to support massive investments in Green New Deal programs now. Imagine spending 4 to 8 years passing incremental legislation and investing modest amounts of money in emissions reductions, and then shifting to fiscal conservative control of Congress and the White House in 2028 having only made small emissions reductions.\n\nIt is no longer reasonable to be fiscally conservative, because of the reality of climate change. If it is conceivable that America could elect a fiscally conservative Congress anytime in the future, then it is upon this new Congress and Administration to make any future Congress and Administration irrelevant in the fight to address climate change.\n\nIn other words, we don\u2019t have the luxury of going back and forth anymore. The planet cannot withstand the long term impacts of the American political pendulum continuing to swing in and out of its favor. This new Congress and Administration must make the pursuit of a sustainable future permanent and disconnect that pursuit from the turmoil of politics. We need a Hail Mary play, not to win, but rather to just stay in the fight against climate change. We need that Hail Mary play to last a century, and we need it to work, which means we need some redundancy. Doug Flutie didn\u2019t send one receiver down field. He sent three. We need to develop and deploy hundreds of programs and initiatives that address climate change, and send them off into the future with permanent and sufficient funding.",

        "text": "Having a high control of themselves is the job of a skilled leader. Needless to say, there is no person in this world who could suppress panics and strong emotions without eventually becoming physically or psychologically ill.\n\nThe interviewed founders shared learnings that helped them to become stronger winners at their lowest points.\n\n1. Asking for help\n\nOne of the hardest things for a founder to do is to ask for help.\n\nMany want to resolve everything themselves without allowing anybody and even themselves to see their weaknesses.\n\nTalking with the right people about the problems lets us unstuck ourselves from the same perspective and see the situations from new lights.\n\nAsking for help only means resolving problems faster! And time is the essence of the startup.\n\n2. Finding emotional support\n\nLack of emotional support was what makes founders quit too soon.\n\nHaving a supportive community of like-minded fellow entrepreneurs helped many in restoring the motivation. It becomes important to see that you are not alone going through rough times and it\u2019s a normal part of every startup journey.\n\nIn addition, every interviewed successful founder revealed that they had a special person with whom they could privately and openly vent about their complicated situations and their feelings.\n\nHowever, that person was not just any person, it was a person would it be a friend, spouse, family member, mentor or coach who knew how to provide needed emotional safety and right kind of help.\n\n3. Building a family\n\nThe most unexpected find from the interviews was that many founders mentioned how having family and children helped them to succeed in the startup life.\n\nIt is expected that founders would spend many nights in the office in building their startups. There is even a notion that if a founder that goes home at 7 pm is not serious about their venture\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cSometimes you feel guilty for not working as many hours as others while building a startup but at the same time having a family keeps everything that is happening in a startup world in perspective. Family and children remind you what is most important in life.\u201d\n\nThis perspective helped founders in managing the mental sanity and make better decisions in the startup. Making time for family thought how to better structure days. Also, the family provided so needed emotional or even financial support during hard times in building a venture.\n\nBy talking to people you don\u2019t let yourself be dragged down the hall of the spiraling negative thoughts and emotions. Expressing frustration of \u201cwhat the fuck to do next\u201d and having a chance to tell what you feel. Having a supportive family who does not put pressure on you keeps you balanced.\n\nWhat helped you to overcome the hardest times?",

        "title": "\u201cHoly\u201d: Jamila Woods\u2019s HEAVN Finds Spiritual Freedom in Solitude",
        "text": "Solitude has a stigma. Our society harshly judges a solo life in any capacity \u2014 from the simple decisions of attending a movie alone to the major life choices of not getting married. When we see people alone, we may think they are antisocial, defective, or even criminal in nature. This toxic judgement prevents us from deepening our relationship with ourselves and our brains. Without a sense of conviction in our solitude, we cannot be fully at peace with ourselves and our place in the world. It is only with a deeper sense of freedom in our solitary experiences that our relationships, goals, and health can fully blossom. Jamila Woods moves towards this solitude on \u201cHoly\u201d, the penultimate track off her outstanding debut album HEAVN, an angelic and stirring standout that highlights the human capacity to thrive within oneself.\n\n\u201cHoly\u201d by Jamila Woods\n\nBefore leading fans to inspiration, Jamila Woods blew away audiences everywhere by shining the light on her own ability to thrive.\n\nWith immense lyrical depth and outstanding vocal performance, Jamila stole the show on 2015\u2019s Surf, the debut album from The Social Experiment. On lead single \u201cSunday Candy\u201d, she shocked and awed audiences with her angelic, tender, and rich voice, buoyed by lyrical content of spirituality and peace. On this gospel-infuenced hip-hop track, she delivered a chorus that could make the clouds part and the sun shine down even on the darkest days. Riding the waves of that critical and commercial success, she released 2016\u2019s HEAVN \u2014 capitalizing on her vocal strengths while expanding her lyrical content towards topics like racial identity, gender politics, hometown reflections, and internal purpose.\n\nThrough these topics, Jamila never stops searching for her own personal heaven.\n\n\u201cGive me today my daily bread / Help me to walk alone ahead / Though I walk through the darkest valley I will fear no love / Oh my smile my mind reassure me I don\u2019t need no one\u201d\n\nJamila opens the song with a steady and passionate vocal delivery that immediately absorbs you into the heady atmosphere of the track. She punctuates each word with an ever-so-slight staccato that perfectly lands in sync with the drum beat. This contrasting combination allows the gravity of each word to sink in while maintaining a comforting levity throughout the track. That levity allows us to maintain hope as Jamila recounts the rollercoaster of feelings that comes with our lease on life.\n\nWith references to Christian theology, she acknowledges that the expedition of life is often one that is both solitary and spiritual. In this expedition, we will trek though the darkest valleys. Trying to do this without a flashlight, guidebook, or a crew can be one of the most terrifying undertakings. Yet when we remember that we always have ourselves for support through the ebbs and flows, a conviction so powerful begins to overtake us.\n\nWith a new conviction, often comes an epiphany.\n\n\u201cWoke up this morning with my mind set on loving me / With my mind set on loving me / I\u2019m not lonely, I\u2019m alone / And I\u2019m holy by my own\u201d\n\nWith a simple but enlightening chorus, Jamila shifts the connotations of being alone that have been ingrained in so many of us. We can be surrounded by tons of people but still feel empty and lonely, and we can be all by ourselves yet brim with fulfillment. As we create more of the latter moments for ourselves, we make the sacred transition from loneliness to solitude.\n\nThe electronic-tinged synth loops, jazz-influenced drum pattern, and soothing horns all build in a slow-moving fashion allowing for a steady energy that grows fuller as the song progresses with Jamila\u2019s journey. This instrumentation coupled with her heavenly and seasoned vocals, create an environment that is just as internally convicted as it is externally triumphant.\n\nThis triumph is not without the acknowledgement of life\u2019s hard truths.\n\n\u201cYe, the bad days may come / The lover may leave / The winter may not / Hey, the map of your palms / The temple you be / You\u2019re all that you got\u201d\n\nWith these words and her mature-sounding vocal delivery, Jamila gives an impression of someone who has seen pain and hardship directly in the face but has maintained a level of practical determination to not wither in the storms of life. As the horns crescendo and an injection of soulful crooning supports Jamila\u2019s final chorus, her determination transfers to the listening audience. We leave the song understanding that life is hard, but we begin to internalize the idea that our capacity to thrive in times of solitary strife may have been severely underrated.\n\nAs college has come and gone, and I have moved to a major city, this stage of my life has naturally veered into a more solitary direction. I still see and connect with friends, family, and co-workers on a highly regular basis, but I also have begun to spend much more time alone. Even more jarring than that, my life path has become much more of a solo endeavor. The intense camaraderie that defined my life has disappeared as I am no longer in the same structural bubble of the American education system.\n\nThis change was difficult at first. What begun as a pretty intense bout of loneliness slowly transformed into a great focus on myself. I began to take much better care of my mental and physical health, creating a more disciplined food, sleep, and exercise routine, along with taking full advantage of my company\u2019s free mental healthcare benefits. I started my music publication, which deeply reconnected me with my core values and made me profoundly optimistic of where I could take my dreams. All these changes skyrocketed my ability to be self-compassionate and deepened in me a strong sense of self-efficacy.\n\nThese types of transformative experiences crystalize in the moments we spend with ourselves. These are times when we can ponder, reflect, and process our lives completely without distraction or input. Eventually, this time of disconnection can lead us to a place where our greatest values and hopes are no longer this drifting ephemeral cloud that is impossible to grasp, but a burning spiritual fire that is at the forefront of our consciousness. While crippling and painful at first, this solitude eventually builds us in ways we could have never imagined.\n\nIn this solitude, we find our freedom.",

        "title": "How Google and Its Geeks Nudge Each Other to Sustainability",
        "text": "When you think of working at Google, what likely comes to mind are the legendary perks, the game rooms, free haircuts, and napping pods. But while the Silicon Valley titan has earned a reputation as a leader in corporate sustainability, less evident is its use of certain perks to encourage employees to reduce their own environmental footprints. Likewise, sometimes the supersmart \u201cGooglers\u201d are the ones pushing the green envelope.\n\nGoogle\u2019s sustainability cred comes in part from its status as the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, not counting utilities. Since 2010, the company has signed 20 agreements to purchase roughly 2.6 gigawatts, about the same as taking 1.2 million cars off the road.\n\nGoogle is also on track to reach its goal of using 100 percent clean power across its operations this year. To be clear, this does not mean that the company will run entirely on wind and solar, but that Google will purchase renewable electricity each year equal to the amount of electricity its global operations consume.\n\nBut clean energy is only part of the picture. The company has numerous energy efficiency and waste reduction initiatives at its offices and data centers, which save money while reducing environmental impact.\n\nBecause we\u2019re talking about Google, these efforts often involve the use of various digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (more on that in a bit), to solve problems. For example, while Google provides compost bins in its famous caf\u00e9s where employees chow down on free gourmet meals, its chefs use digital scales designed by a company called LeanPath to monitor supply and usage in the kitchen to improve meal planning and reduce waste in the preparation process.\n\nThe company thinks about waste in a \u201cbroader framework\u201d and is trying \u201cto design waste out of our systems altogether,\u201d says Kate Brandt, chief sustainability officer at Google. \u201cIt certainly has some parallels with energy efficiency \u2014 there\u2019s a great business case for it as well a great environmental benefits.\u201d\n\nThrough its waste reduction, composting, and reuse and recycling programs, Google has reached an 86 percent landfill diversion rate at its Bay Area offices and 78 percent globally. This year, the goal is another 10 percent reduction per Bay Area employee compared with 2015, as well as a new set of regional targets.\n\nBikes and Burgers\n\nFood is one of two areas where perks at Google overlap with incentivizing employees to shrink their environmental footprint. The other is transportation.\n\nFirst, workers must commute to the compounds where they infamously spend much of their time. The company\u2019s shuttles, which run on 5 percent biofuel and include heavy-duty filtration systems, have been a fixture on Bay Area highways for a decade now.\n\nIn 2015, use of Google shuttles and the more recently added corporate electric vehicles netted an annual savings of 29,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of taking 5,700 cars off the road. Globally, the company has installed more than 1,600 electric vehicle charging ports at its offices and data centers, and employees can charge their cars at work for free.\n\nThe company also gives an electric pedal-assist bike, lock, and helmet to any employee at its Silicon Valley headquarters who wants to make biking his or her primary means of commuting.\n\nThe overall goal: to reduce single-occupancy vehicle commuting at the headquarters to 45 percent by transitioning more workers to shuttles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking. (Google does not prohibit working from home, but neither does it particularly promote it.)\n\nMeanwhile, back at the company\u2019s caf\u00e9s, you\u2019ll find more covert attempts at changing employee lifestyle. For example, Google is subtly nudging its workers toward a less meat-intensive diet, according to a recent report by Fast Company. Meat consumption contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 by one estimate, raising livestock for meat, dairy, and eggs is responsible for 14.5 percent of emissions globally.\n\nGoogle\u2019s chefs prepare various vegan dishes \u2014 often made with \u201cugly produce\u201d bought at a discount and saved from the landfill \u2014 but the company doesn\u2019t try to convert meat lovers immediately to a fully vegetarian diet. Instead, its strategy is to reduce meat consumption, such as with its \u201cblended\u201d burger that uses mushrooms to cut the amount of beef in each patty.\n\nNow here\u2019s the covert part: Over time, the company has slowly increased the percentage of mushrooms, which add moisture and soak up the flavor of the beef as they cook, in each burger from 20 percent to 50 percent. In other dishes, meat might shift from being the center of the meal to a side or garnish.\n\nGeeking Out on Energy Efficient Data Centers\n\nGoogle corporate doesn\u2019t always do the nudging. It has an incredibly talented staff coming up with new ideas during each lap in the onsite pool.\n\nBrandt tells the story of Jim Gao, a former Google efficiency engineer who last year made it his mission to use artificial intelligence to reduce energy use at the company\u2019s data centers, which as of 2015 already used 50 percent less energy than the industry average.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t think about it every time you send an email, comment on a social media post, or watch the latest YouTube clip, but it takes a network of enormous energy-consuming data centers to keep the internet humming 24/7. This connectivity, like everything, comes at a cost.\n\nGlobally, data centers consume 3 percent of the world\u2019s energy (around 420 terawatts) and emit 2 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, according to Yole D\u00e9veloppement, a French market research and consulting company focused on the technology industry. Google has 14 data centers around the world and has long considered its servers to be the front line of its sustainability efforts.\n\nGao did his work via a 20% Project, a company program that allows employees to use 20 percent of their time at work to solve a particular problem. He had taken a class in machine learning, a type of AI that gives computers the ability to learn things without being explicitly programmed. Basically, computers can teach themselves through repetition how to interpret large amounts of data.\n\nGoogle was already using machine learning to improve features like language translation and image recognition. When you ask Google Photos for pictures of cats in a box, Google\u2019s machine learning algorithms find the photos you want. So Goa wondered: Why not use this tech to reduce server energy use?\n\nHe soon discovered why not. With all of the different variables, Goa and his data center intelligence team were looking at billions of distinct configurations, a set of possibilities far beyond the ability of any human to test. So Goa joined forces with Google\u2019s leading AI research group, DeepMind, which had recently gained attention for its work on a computer agent that taught itself to play not just one, but every Atari game really well. (Goa now works for DeepMind full-time.)\n\nGoa\u2019s team and DeepMind used a model of broader, more generalized algorithms and came up with a solution: General beats specific. Since their discovery, the models have been piloted at multiple data centers and have produced a 40 percent reduction in energy used for cooling and a 15 percent reduction in overall energy overhead.\n\nGoa is far from an anomaly. \u201cNot a week goes by that I\u2019m not talking to someone about a new idea or a potential 20% project,\u201d says Brandt.\n\nGoogle\u2019s monstrous volume of servers has also become an example of deploying what\u2019s called the \u201ccircular economy\u201d at scale, says Brandt. The circular economy is the buzzword for the latest incarnation of waste reduction, which involves designing more efficient systems (or products or equipment) where materials are endlessly cycled back through via repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. (Remember the LeanPath scale? That\u2019s an example of designing waste out of a system.)\n\nGoogle starts with server maintenance so equipment can be used as long as possible. Servers that can\u2019t be kept on the floor get pulled off and sent to a central hub for remanufacturing. Functioning parts that the company no longer needs, such as hard drives, are wiped clean and sold on the secondary market. Anything left over gets recycled through the company\u2019s recycling partners.\n\nLast year, the company diverted 86 percent of its data center waste away from landfills. As of September, Google\u2019s goal is zero waste to landfills at all 14 of its locations.\n\n\u201cWe definitely set a stretch goal to reach zero waste to landfill, but this is the kind of challenge we get excited about,\u201d says Brandt. \u201cWe like to solve these gnarly problems.\u201d\n\nSolve on, gnarly Googlers.",

        "text": "J.K. Rowling\u2019s Advice For Writers With Big Dreams\n\nA simple and highly effective way to up your game\n\nPhoto by Rae Tian on Unsplash\n\nJ.K. Rowling is the richest writer in the world.\n\nMaking a fortune on children\u2019s book seems impossible. But it happened for her, and it happened again and again.\n\nAs legend has it, Harry Potter came to her when she was riding a train. She started writing as soon as she got home.\n\nYou never know where and when a great idea will present itself to you.\n\nWrite them all down when they show up. Take time to flesh them out and lead you in new directions.\n\nThat\u2019s where great writing starts.\n\nBut if you really want to be the best writer you can be, you\u2019ve got to do one simple thing repeatedly.\n\nWrite the Rubbish Out\n\nRowling is British. I\u2019m using her word for verbal garbage here.\n\nYou get good at anything by being bad at it first.\n\nThe first time you drive a car, you better practice in a wide open space like an empty parking lot while school\u2019s out. This is smart because you won\u2019t hit another car with yours while you\u2019re learning how hard to press the gas and hit the brake. You won\u2019t annoy the people behind because nobody is behind you. Do this enough and by the time you hit the road, no one has to fear for their life.\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent, you know kids are born with foolishness built in. Your job is to drive it out of them so they navigate life well and stay out of constant trouble.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. But if you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019ll pay dearly for it later.\n\nWhen you first start writing from a raw idea, it might not make much sense. That\u2019s okay. Just like bodybuilders have to warm up their muscles before they pump iron, writers have to warm up their pens a bit before the words flow with ease and elegance.\n\nYou can\u2019t skip this step if you want to be a great writer.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to share the rubbish.\n\nThe next point will sound counter to that, but trust me, it isn\u2019t.\n\nPhoto by Est\u00e9e Janssens on Unsplash\n\nShare your failures\n\nDo you want to be perfect?\n\nI understand. I want to be perfect, too. And I\u2019ve tried really hard.\n\nI can\u2019t do it.\n\nPerfection is at best, elusive and subjective.\n\nIt\u2019s elusive because you can always look at your work tomorrow and say, \u201cI could have done that better.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t torture yourself.\n\nAll great art isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s finished. The artist stopped somewhere. You must too, if you want to publish and ship regularly.\n\nPerfect is subjective because one person\u2019s awesome is another one\u2019s awful. Want to please everyone? You can\u2019t. Please the ones who care about what you care about.\n\nSo show us your flaws. Share your failures. We know you\u2019re not thrilled about them. But that one bad experience, framed the right way, can bring someone the hope they\u2019ve been longing for.\n\nCan you think of a better gift than that?\n\nWe can\u2019t relate to people with perfect lives. We love those who succeed despite the fact they\u2019re as messed up as we are.\n\nSo go ahead, share that mess.\n\nChoose the right goal\n\nWe\u2019ve kicked perfection to the curb.\n\nWhat do we have left to focus on?\n\nEffectiveness.\n\nHow can you leave someone better than you found them?\n\nHow can your story give hope to others who struggle?\n\nHow deep can you dig to show that you care and that it\u2019s okay to be messed up?\n\nHonest writers make the best connections with readers.\n\nAm I telling you not to aim high?\n\nNo way.\n\nCompete with who you were yesterday. It\u2019s the only fair contest. Define your mission so clearly you know what it will take to achieve it. Consider each post to be part of a body of work dedicated to that mission.\n\nEach time you write your heart out you move one step closer to achieving your mission.\n\nIt all starts when you embrace the rubbish within. Write it out and you\u2019ll find the gold.",

        "title": "F. Scott Fitzgerald on How to Write Masterful Dialogue",
        "text": "September 22 marked the beginning of autumn, and it reminded me of this wonderful quote from The Great Gatsby,\n\n\u201cLife starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.\u201d\n\nAs the quote repeated itself in my brain, I wondered what part of the book it came from. There are so many quotes like this one that people lift from books and share across Instagram and other social media sites, devoid of their original context.\n\nSo I went in search of the quote and found it on page 107 of my edition of The Great Gatsby. It\u2019s a line of dialogue that the character Jordan says in reply to Gatsby\u2019s love interest, Daisy:\n\n\u2018What\u2019ll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\u2019 cried Daisy, \u2018and the day after that, and the next thirty years?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t be morbid,\u2019 Jordan said. \u2018Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.\u2019\n\nThe writer in me sprang to attention and said, \u201cWhat masterfully written dialogue!\u201d\n\nPerhaps I could glean several tips from Fitzgerald that would help me to write masterful dialogue as well.\n\nSo I continued reading a little more of the scene and came away with these three takeaways.\n\n1. Increase Conflict Through Contradiction\n\nConflict makes a story a story. If The Great Gatsby were just about Nick Carraway\u2019s stay in a cottage in New York and described his rather monotonous daily routine, the book would not have become a bestseller. Instead, the book is full of shocking plot twists: murders, affairs, and more.\n\nJust as conflict drives the plot of a story forward, it drives dialogue forward as well.\n\nNotice in the lines of dialogue above that Jordan is reproving Daisy. This adds tension to the conversation and also introduces the unexpected, which keeps readers on their toes.\n\nEach of your characters should have their own unique personalities. This means they\u2019ll probably disagree with each other more often than they would agree.\n\nI delved into this more in the YouTube video I recently made about the dinner table exercise. You can watch it here.\n\nHow to Put This Tip Into Action: I\u2019ve found this tip very helpful for editing the novel I recently finished writing. I\u2019d written several scenes with long conversations, and I realized they weren\u2019t very interesting because it was just one character speaking their mind. I introduced disagreement and questioning from other characters, and the conversations became much more interesting to read and revealed much more about the characters\u2019 personalities.\n\nAs you write a conversation in your story or novel, experiment with having characters disagree with each other. You might find that the conversation ends up going in a different direction than you had originally intended and makes your plot even more intriguing.\n\n2. Avoid Writing Dialogue That\u2019s \u201cOn the Nose\u201d\n\nAs I continued reading the scene from The Great Gatsby, I realized that it was the part of the story where Daisy accidently reveals she loves Gatsby in front of her husband, Tom. Here\u2019s what Fitzgerald writes,\n\n\u2018Who wants to go to town?\u2019 demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby\u2019s eyes floated toward her. \u2018Ah,\u2019 she cried, \u2018you look so cool.\u2019 Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. \u2018You always look so cool,\u2019 she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded.\n\nNotice that Daisy doesn\u2019t say out loud to Gatsby that she loves him. Instead, she merely says that he looks cool. Fitzgerald explains that the underlying subtext is that she loves Gatsby. The subtlety of her words makes the scene compelling.\n\nThis is a fantastic reminder not to write dialogue that is \u201con the nose.\u201d Try to avoid having your characters say something that\u2019s obvious to the reader or reveals exactly what the character is feeling or thinking with no subtext.\n\nHow To Put This Tip Into Action: Take a story or other manuscript you\u2019ve written and see if there is any \u201con the nose\u201d dialogue. Rewrite it to make the scene more engaging for your readers. Instead of having a character exclaim, \u201cI\u2019m angry!\u201d show us the character is angry through their actions and facial expressions and through a more subtle line of dialogue.\n\nA quick note, though, that \u201con the nose\u201d dialogue isn\u2019t always a no-no. A demure, soft-spoken old lady who suddenly lashes out and exclaims, \u201cI\u2019m furious!\u201d will pique your readers\u2019 curiosity.\n\nSo only avoid \u201con the nose\u201d dialogue if it is stating something obvious or if it is not revealing further details about the character\u2019s personality.\n\n3. Hint at the Theme of Your Story\n\nHere are two more fantastic lines of dialogue from this scene:\n\n\u2018She\u2019s got an indiscreet voice,\u2019 I remarked. \u2018It\u2019s full of \u2014 \u2018\n\nI hesitated. \u2018Her voice is full of money,\u2019 he said suddenly. That was it. I\u2019d never understood before. It was full of money \u2014 that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals\u2019 song of it\u2026.\n\nFitzgerald uses the line of dialogue \u201cHer voice is full of money\u201d to hint at one of the themes of the story: the shallowness of the upper class, who hide behind their wealth.\n\nIn his book Storycraft, editor Jack Hart notes the importance of having a theme or lesson in your piece of writing,\n\n\u201cTheme gives the audience a sense of time well invested. (What\u2019s the point of reading unless reading has a point?)\u2026When you think about it, every theme incorporates a lesson. That\u2019s the value added that draws an audience to a story in the first place. The bigger the lesson, the more value added. The biggest have the enduring quality we associate with great literature.\u201d\n\nYou can convey your story\u2019s theme in a lot of different ways: character arcs, plot structure, etc. And, as we see in The Great Gatsby, you can also convey the theme through dialogue.\n\nHow To Put This Tip Into Action: When you attempt to convey a theme through dialogue, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of having a character preach at the reader for several long paragraphs. Fitzgerald shows how to convey a theme with just a single sentence of dialogue.\n\nLook at a piece you\u2019ve written and see if you have any characters (maybe even the narrator) preaching at the readers. See if you can simplify what they\u2019re saying into just one memorable line or two. Conversely, if you have a piece where you haven\u2019t conveyed the theme as strongly as you\u2019d like, see if you can work it in through a line of dialogue.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nI\u2019m sure if we continued studying Fitzgerald\u2019s novel we could glean many more tips for how to write memorable dialogue, but these three are a fantastic starting point.\n\nAnd while Fitzgerald was a renowned writer, these three techniques are simple and straightforward. You can start using them right away to take the dialogue in your stories to the next level.",

        "text": "Mesensei is a company that designs and creates mobile solutions for organisations and companies. The company turned to Kodan when they wanted to renew some of their software development processes and make them more effective, productive and cost-effective. After some brainstorming, we decided to focus on transforming part of their service into the cloud. The result of teaming up with Mesensei was a modern new way of working that Mesensei can now carry out independently in their future projects.\n\nThe project: Designing new architecture to streamline product development\n\nWe were excited to be asked by Mesensei to kick their product into a new gear and speed up their development by offering technical help. We wanted to design the new architecture in a way that would support and enhance the company\u2019s business model. Transforming the process was a challenge, but we here at Kodan love a good challenge!\n\nMoving to the cloud for flexibility and safety\n\nAt the start of the project, we felt the vibe about where Mesensei was at and then had a brainstorming sessions to chat about where they wanted to go next. Deciding to split the system into several smaller parts and moving those into a cloud infrastructure, we used the microservice architecture approach, because operating in the cloud improves system performance and safety, and makes everything easier to maintain.\n\nWe chose the Mesensei\u2019s API for images as our test feature that we would move into the cloud. As the projectt kicked off, we noticed we could also offer Mesensei valuable help with programming and provide them with more workforce.\n\nKicking off with the modernization at the beginning of 2019, we used AWS and node.js tools and brought in a senior and a junior coder, which also helped us amp up our own knowledge. While our developers Nikolas, Juho and Jan worked with moving the image API into the cloud, Mesensei\u2019s programmers were able to get on with their own work, using the existing system uninterrupted.\n\nResult: Cloud-based microarchitecture, clear direction and more tools for the future\n\nThe project didn\u2019t need a hefty investment in terms of money or time. All in all, it was a swift move that will help Mesensei to do the same with the rest of their services in the future, and in general enables new, established processes. New features can now be developed and implemented faster than ever.\n\nAt the end of our collaboration, Mesensei was happy with the work we\u2019d done together and the smoothness of the process. We\u2019re stoked to have helped them on their journey toward expansion.\n\n\u201cWorking with Kodan has been a breeze. They were quick and efficient, and we got solid and concrete results fast.\u201d - Tuukka Yl\u00e4lahti, Co-founder & CEO at Mesensei\n\n\u2014\n\nFor more information about the case, contact our CEO Marko Loukkola: marko.loukkola@kodan.fi or +358 (0)44 552 5952.\n\nFor more Kodan: www | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram",

        "title": "How are Big Tech Companies Dominating the Markets in the Global Arena?",
        "text": "Our focus today will be on big tech companies. Let\u2019s take, for example, Amazon, Apple, etc.,\n\nAmazon\n\nLet\u2019s say, for example, it is called as the gatekeeper of e-commerce. It reduces the competition and harms the consumers and people who are not putting their products on this particular platform. Let\u2019s say, for example, Amazon has a huge amount of money in its kitty. It decimates the brick and mortar stores and it makes sure that it is collecting all the data of a particular customer. This also pushes a product to the customer such that his data and privacy are also compromised. So Amazon being too big and has a huge market dominance has become impossible for other companies to dominate over Amazon.\n\nApple\n\nApart from this, when it comes to Apple. Apple also favors its own applications. It also puts rivals at a disadvantage as well, and when it comes to Apple and Google, they are on a buying spree as well. Whenever they see a competition that is popping up against the hegemony of these companies, they immediately buy that particular company rather than competing with them. Instagram and WhatsApp could have become the competitors of Facebook, but since they saw that they could not compete with Instagram, they immediately grab an opportunity to buy that specific company; the same is with Apple and Google.\n\nWhen it comes to Google, it buys at least one firm a month, and when it comes to Apple, it buys two to three firms every single month, says statistics.\n\nSo what would be the impact?\n\nWhen it comes to the impact, the consumers or the customers who have been availing their services will have limited opportunities. Since they have limited opportunities, they will not have multiple options as well. This ultimately means that they have to go buy that particular service only from big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, or in fact, Facebook as well. And as a result, what will happen? The consumer base will also start increasing only with respect to those big tech companies. So what will happen? We are giving away our data, and this particular data, when it is given, can be violated, which will violate the right to privacy. Initially, when Facebook had come, initially when there was Google as well, all these people used to respect the right to privacy with eventuality when there is no competition.\n\nThey also take up our data and manipulate our data because data is the new fuel for Facebook and Google. So what do they do? They target our inboxes with what is called as the advertisement with which we attempted to buy a particular product as well. They also understand what our political inclinations are, and they also play a political role as well. Such is the devastation that they cause when it comes to the consumers.\n\nNow when it comes to India. Let\u2019s look at some of the statistics. More than 400 million of Whatsapp\u2019s estimated two billion users are in India. Amazon has around one-third of the share of online retail in India, neck to neck with Flipkart, which was recently acquired by Wal-Mart. Then we have India as Facebook\u2019s largest single market with around 270 million accounts. Google completely dominates the search engine space in India. Most smartphones in India are also Android-based OS.\n\nSince they are dominating in India, this article suggests that for the Competition Commission of India and elsewhere in their own countries for more regulation. When it comes to countries in Europe and the United States of America, they are also planning to break companies as well. One such suggestion was given by the federal agency in the United States of America. Back in the 1980s, we have AT&T, which had also gone too huge when it comes to its market. So what was decided by the federal agency back then? They had to break this AT&T and split this particular organization.\n\nSimilarly, they are also planning a proposal with respect to Facebook as well. The split will be Facebook as an independent organization. We will also have Instagram as an independent organization or an application and WhatsApp as an independent application. So this is a suggestion given by the federal agency. So they do not have all the hold in the market, and there are diversification and more options given to the customers as well. This is one of the proposals given by the federal agency and also in European countries as well.\n\nAlso, remember, when it comes to companies like Facebook or Google, they have a cozy relationship with political parties in India as well. So what we require is more regulations, more laws to control the dominance of the big tech firms. And at the same time, India does not have a privacy law. So when it comes up with privacy law, they have to make sure all these aspects of data collection are taken into the picture when a law is being drafted.\n\nGain Access to Expert View \u2014 Subscribe to DDI Intel",

        "title": "\u2018Am I Just Lazy?\u2019",
        "text": "We\u2019ve got an obsession with productivity. \u201cHacks\u201d for life are everywhere, covering every aspect of human existence. We can hack relationships, jobs, household tasks, and more. So many of us are obsessed with efficiency in our own private sphere. Our never ending search for peak productivity becomes a whole distraction from productivity in and of itself\u2026\n\nSo what is the answer then, for that person who doesn\u2019t move at the same pace? For whom doing anything seems to be hard? Who never seems motivated or interested in anything?\n\nWhen I started grappling with my own mental health, I remember becoming distinctly aware of the notion that one should just \u201cbuck up\u201d, and get on with things \u2014 that that was the only \u201creal\u201d way out of depression. \u201cJust do more stuff,\u201d came the advice. Perhaps this is the obvious argument in a world where we are all driven to do more, when we see someone who doesn\u2019t seem driven anywhere. \u201cDoing more\u201d seems like the obvious counter. That absolutely does not work for someone who is depressed; having commitments, activities and routine can certainly help prevent depression and keep things moving. But in a low, just pummelling yourself with the guilt associated with not doing anything will really do very little for you. So is that person being lazy, or are they actually depressed?\n\nMental health is such a complex issue, and I have written many times about depression and how to handle it. The only possible way I have noticed that we can differentiate between laziness and an actual problem comes when that person is out of the worst part of the cycle. Most people I know with depression aren\u2019t content to keep on suffering \u2014 in my opinion, it\u2019s pretty hard to be okay with being depressed. Obviously they\u2019re unhappy \u2014 low moods are part of depression \u2014 but they also want to know that there\u2019s another option and much of the time, unless they are really truly in the lowest part of the cycle, they want potentially to work towards a better place. At the lowest point, this isn\u2019t something that can even be imagined. If someone is suicidal, they aren\u2019t thinking about changing their depression, they\u2019re thinking about what would give relief, most quickly. Because depression is painful.\n\nLaziness, on the other hand, is something else entirely. And the lazy person doesn\u2019t really seem to mind quite so much \u2014 it isn\u2019t painful to them to be that way. It\u2019s easy. And easy is what they\u2019re going for.\n\nSo, firstly: engage in some direct self reflection\n\nIt\u2019s pretty hard to outwardly tell the difference sometimes between laziness and depression, even for ourselves. Only you, as an individual, can ask yourself for the truth and face your own reality. Are you dealing with a mental health problem, or have you always shown a tendency towards laziness? Most people don\u2019t become lazy overnight. So think back: how likely were you to finish things in school? Or keep up hobbies? How often do you see projects or ideas through to completion, or keep on working at something until you feel you\u2019ve achieved something tangible? Are you looking for the first opportunity to shift into a new shiny activity? Or are you always picking up new hobbies? Are you someone who leaves things unfinished?\n\nIf none of this sounds like you but lately things have been getting darker, harder to deal with, and the world seems a bit more grey than it should, you might well be experiencing low mood and potentially even depression. In which case, you need to start by understanding that, and how to take care of yourself in that mode.\n\nSet the baseline and break it down into achievable parts\n\nWe\u2019ve all got to eat healthy, exercise and sleep, in order to have the energy to do things we want or need to do. So it\u2019s time to set the baseline: when should you be getting into bed each night? How can you ensure that you do that? Do you need to create a nighttime routine? What about in the morning? I\u2019m personally quite a light sleeper, so one alarm and I\u2019m up. But you need to learn how to make mornings work for you. That doesn\u2019t mean cramming in an entire second life before work, the way many productivity blogs advise. I personally do do that, I\u2019ll be honest; but I love mornings. If you are not a morning person, then work with it, not against it.\n\nConsider taking up meditation. Find a type of exercise that works for you, that you actually enjoy. Take these things one step at a time and practice some self-compassion as you experiment. Take note of what works, and what definitely doesn\u2019t work \u2014 literally write it down.\n\nFigure out where your focus should be\n\nValues. They\u2019re everything. I wrote about this recently, because I think the process of figuring out your core values is really important. Often laziness comes from an inability to focus on what you need to do \u2014 things feel overwhelming perhaps, or there\u2019s so much to get done that you feel paralysed. But taking a breath and a step back is really important. Figure out what should be holding your attention \u2014 where your values truly lie. From here, there\u2019s a much better chance you will be able to get moving again. It\u2019s the fog of laziness and an inability to prioritise that can become easy stopping points.\n\nIt\u2019s time: Face your fears\n\nSometimes \u2018laziness\u2019 is actually just \u2018fear\u2019 in disguise. Like, you\u2019re afraid to commit to doing something you might fail at.\n\nI know what that\u2019s like. Intimately. And living that way isn\u2019t great. It\u2019s a pretty good way to subject yourself to constant unease and guilt. Because ultimately only we can decide to bite the bullet and commit to doing the thing that scares us most. And if it\u2019s living life the way you really want to, it comes down to this:\n\nWill you be okay to die wondering? Ultimately, what will my life look like, when I look back on it? The idea that I might get old and die without having ever tried was more terrifying than any of my objections \u2014 than any other fear my mind could conjure up. I needed to write. I needed to try and to know my own currency.\n\nSo\u2026\n\nDo one thing first\n\nJust one thing that will move you in the direction of your values. Making the conscious effort to stop sitting around or finding excuses to do whatever is easiest is going to be the tough first step. Put down the game, stop Instagramming, don\u2019t text gifs to your friends. Just think: what is it I want to be doing with my life? What are my values? And what one thing can I do to enact them? Even if it is starting with making a list. Just start.",

        "text": "\u201cWe must actively, consciously, consistently, and creatively nurture our artist selves.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Julia Cameron, The Artist\u2019s Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity\n\nAre you like me? You get some of your very best ideas in the shower. You swear you will remember them \u2014 they\u2019re that good. And then you get busy with life. Finally, you settle down to capture your brainstorm. Maybe it\u2019s a catchy headline or blogging topic. But you draw a blank. Where the F- did it go?\n\nAccording to Julia Cameron, author of The Artist\u2019s Way, and others who study such things, when we\u2019re doing repetitive actions that don\u2019t require a lot of concentration, like walking, washing dishes, showering, gardening, etc., our brain is relaxed and free to roam.\n\nNeuroscientists who study the brain have found that exercise not only strengthens muscles and other body functions, but it generates new neurons and neural connections in the brain. Athlete and coach Christopher Bergland interviewed scientists on this topic for Psychology Today:\n\nAlthough there is some controversy and debate on the best ways to improve fluid intelligence, common sense would suggest that non-academic pursuits \u2014 including aerobic exercise \u2014 are key to improving not only cognition but someone\u2019s long-term success in life. I have written a wide range of Psychology Today blog posts that link \u2014 physical activity, playing a musical instrument, making art, improving motor skills, and getting a good night\u2019s sleep \u2014 with optimizing brain function and improving cognitive abilities.\n\nHere\u2019s my over-simplified take on it: When our brain is not needed for a specific task, it\u2019s free to roam. Anywhere \u2014 through the fields of memories, scanning and reviewing some of the over-stimulating content it\u2019s been fed non-stop with no time to process: snippets from ads, phone calls, videos, Twitter, etc.\n\nOur brains love to make connections and solve puzzles.\n\nWhat if? is a great question for a brain \u2014 harvesting the fruit of those new neural connections. What if this character from this book met up with that character from that book? (Great idea, but make sure the characters are in public domain first!!!)\n\nAnd brainstorming! Our brains love to make lists. I do this on my Iphone\u2019s microphone feature while out on my nightly sunset walk.\n\nTalking into my Notes app, I\u2019ll brainstorm headlines for possible articles \u2014 the more ridiculous, the better, as that gets the juices flowing. This is how I do my pitch idea homework for my satire class. (Yes, while a lot of it comes naturally, taking a class from Second City sure helps me develop whatever gifts I may have in this area!)\n\nOr topics for articles and book ideas for BYOB \u2014 Blog your own Book. Or who to reach out to for such and such. Or even a to-do list I hadn\u2019t time to write yet.\n\nGet into your groove.\n\nMy theory is it\u2019s the rhythm of these activities that make them so productive. Swimming is one that helped me solve plot glitches. Cameron recommends it as well as the more meditative knitting, for that reason among others.\n\nOnce when I was stuck with a plotting quandary in my novel, a solution popped into my head absolutely unbidden while swimming laps at the Y. I was trying to get my hero\u2019s wife to do his dirty work, and she wasn\u2019t having it.\n\nThe a-ha came when his youngest son popped into my head while doing the crawl. Perfect foil. Too young to know any better. Meanwhile, forcing my brain to come up with a solution usually doesn\u2019t work. When I try that, the ole gray matter likes to rebel!\n\nBergland also validates these experiences in Psychology Today:\n\nMost often, creative solutions are not wrestled from your mind through sheer force of will. Eureka moments tend to occur spontaneously, almost always when the conscious mind is thinking of something else, or nothing at all.\n\nBuild some of these activities into your day.\n\nBecause you need a clean house or at least a clean kitchen. Because you need a clean body. And a healthy one. And you need a break from the left brain non-stop push, push, push.\n\nIt\u2019s your health and sanity, and creative input all rolled into one. But don\u2019t stress or force it. Be relaxed. Take deep breaths, allow it to come. Put on your dictaphone, and just start talking, like how morning pages work.\n\nSooner or later, the ideas just come. Welcome them and corral them. Don\u2019t judge; you never know when it will prove just the perfect fit. As Kevin Costner was told in the film Field of Dreams, \u201cBuild it, and they will come!\u201d\n\nTry it for yourself. Do let us know how this goes for you!!!",

        "text": "Guidelines\n\nHow to get your article ready for publication!\n\nWe aim to strike a balance between innovating, informing and philosophizing. We want to hear from you! But we do ask that if you are not a professional writer, you consider the following points when you prepare your article. We want to publish high quality, professional articles that people want to read.\n\nPlease be aware that if you don\u2019t follow our submission guidelines, your article won\u2019t be accepted.\n\n1. Is your story a story that needs to be told?\n\nBefore you start writing, ask yourself: is this story a story that needs to be told?\n\nIf you have read many articles addressing the same issue or explaining the same concept, think twice before writing another one. If you have a radical, new take on an old chestnut, we want to hear from you\u2026 but, we need you to persuade us that your article is something special that distinguishes itself from the pack and speaks to our audience.\n\nConversely, if your article addresses an underserved area or presents a new idea or method, that\u2019s just what we are after!\n\n2. What is your message?\n\nLet us know what your \u2018take home message\u2019 is, right from the start. Give your piece a snappy introduction that tells us:\n\nWhat is your novel idea?\n\nWhy should we care?\n\nHow are you going to prove your point?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got that out of the way, you can be as conversational as you like, but keep calling back to the central message and give us a solid conclusion.\n\nRemember though, Towards Data Science is not your personal blog, keep it sharp and on-topic!\n\n3. On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog\n\nYou\u2019ve got a new idea or a new way of doing things, you want to tell the community and start a discussion. Fantastic, that\u2019s what we want too, but we\u2019re not going to take for granted that you know what you are talking about or that we should uncritically believe what you say\u2026 you\u2019ve got to persuade us (your audience) that:\n\nThe subject matter is important\n\nThere is a gap that needs to be filled\n\nYou have the answer\n\nYour solution works\n\nYour idea is based on a logical progression of ideas and evidence\n\nIf you are giving us a tutorial, tell us why people would need to use this tool and why your way is better than the methods already published.\n\nYou can do this by explaining the background, showing examples, providing an experiment or just laying out how data you have extracted from various sources allowed you to synthesise this new idea.\n\nAre there arguments that counter your opinion or your findings? Explain why that interpretation conflicts with your idea and why your idea comes out on top.\n\n4. Do you have a short title with an insightful subtitle?\n\nIf you scroll up to the top of this page, you will see an example of a title and subtitle. Your post needs to have a short title and a longer subtitle that tell readers what your article is about or why they should read it. Your header is useful for attracting potential readers and making your intentions clear. To remain consistent and give readers the best experience possible, we do not allow titles or subtitles written in all-caps. We also ask that you avoid profanity in both your title and subtitle.\n\nWhen your subtitle is directly under the title and formatted correctly, it will show up in some post previews, which helps with your click-through rate. To correctly format your subtitle on Medium, type it out, highlight the text and then click the smaller of the two Ts in the popup window.\n\n5. What value do you deliver to your readers?\n\nMake sure your post achieves its purpose. For instance, if your goal is to explain several concepts, ensure that these concepts are bared to their essentials, narrated in an orderly sequence and illustrated with simple and accurate analogies.\n\nSecond, use concrete language and visual imagery. As Steven Pinker puts it in his book The Sense of Style: \u201cWe are primates, with a third of our brains dedicated to vision, and large swaths devoted to touch, hearing, motion, and space. For us to go from \u201cI think I understand\u201d to \u201cI understand,\u201d we need to see the sights and feel the motions.\u201d and he continues \u201cMany experiments have shown that readers understand and remember material far better when it is expressed in concrete language that allows them to form visual images\u201d.\n\nThird, work to improve your writing skills. You could start by replacing linking and light verbs such as \u2018to be, is, going, become, bring, make, take, have\u2019, by more precise action verbs. For example, you could say \u2018agile\u2019 instead of \u2018going fast\u2019. There is plenty of great advice on the internet.\n\nFinally, check for spelling, punctuation and grammatical mistakes. If you can\u2019t do it yourself, use Grammarly and then ask a friend to help you. As we are such a small team, we can\u2019t correct every submission.\n\n6. Is your code well displayed?\n\nPlease don\u2019t screenshot your code but use one of these two other solutions:\n\nMedium\u2019s native code blocks & inline code\n\nEmbed GitHub gists\n\nIf you paste a code within your article, be sure to explain it so all your readers can follow what you are doing.\n\n7. Check your facts\n\nWhenever you provide a fact, if it\u2019s not self-evident, let us know where you learned it. Tell us who your sources are and where your data originated. If we want to have a conversation we all need to be on the same page. Maybe something you say will spark a discussion, but if we want to be sure we are not at cross purposes, we need to go back to the original and read for ourselves in case we are missing a vital piece of the puzzle that makes everything you say make sense.\n\n8. Is your conclusion to the point and not promotional?\n\nPlease make sure that you include a conclusion at the end of your article.

        "text": "Every time I think people can\u2019t amaze me further with their stupidity, I\u2019m sadly mistaken. Yes, stupidity. Or would you rather I say dangerous behavior? Either works.\n\nAs of today, in the United States alone, there have been 13.7m cases of the novel coronavirus, with almost 270k deaths.\n\nWhat in those numbers gives you the idea that travel is a good idea? Now, it would be one thing if people were vacationing to parts unknown, not surrounding themselves with people. But that\u2019s really not the case. People are still going to Disney. The park recently announced they\u2019re open for business again, minus the water parks.\n\nJust be sure if you\u2019re over the age of 2, you wear a mask at all times.\n\nWearing a mask is important for sure. But you can\u2019t tell me a crowd the size of the ones that frequent Disney isn\u2019t a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s not only dangerous, it\u2019s destructive. No amount of memory making is worth the potential for death, or at the least, severe illness.\n\nI blame the companies for agreeing to open in such a dangerous situation. I blame our government for not doing more to stop this on the front end. But I also blame the people of the United States who can\u2019t put their plans on hold for a little longer in order to remain safe, and for the health and well-being of others.\n\nGoing on vacation would be a godsend right now for my family. We\u2019ve been stuck at home since March, invading one another\u2019s space, constantly under each other. Sure, it\u2019s nice to spend time with your family, but enough is enough. Through all this, there\u2019s no vacation on this planet that\u2019s worth our continued health. We even avoided a small Thanksgiving get-together to ensure we remained virus free.\n\nWhether you have children, if you\u2019re single or married, your health and well-being are important. Consistently masking up, only going out when absolutely necessary, and avoiding crowds goes a long way towards ending this pandemic. Taking a family vacation, just because it\u2019s what you\u2019ve always done, isn\u2019t the smart answer.\n\nThe state of the world isn\u2019t what it\u2019s always been. We have to adapt and overcome. Roll with the punches, if you will. But for all that is holy, stay home this holiday season and plan the vacations for when it\u2019s safer. If you don\u2019t, your vacation memories could be the last ones you make.",

        "title": "Google Objectron \u2014 A giant leap for the 3D object detection",
        "text": "bjecrPhoto by Tamara Gak on Unsplash\n\nGoogle Objectron \u2014 A giant leap for the 3D object detection\n\nGoogle has just announced the launch of MediaPipe Objectron, its mobile technology for real-time detection of 3D objects, enabling the smartphone to recognize the size and orientation of objects.\n\nIf there one thing that I love in Google\u2019s research is image analysis. The automatic suggestions of Google Photos or the capabilities of Google Lens are good examples, and the recent news that the company already has its new layer of analysis-ready to understand what is present in each photo.\n\nIf we go a little further, to object detection as such, Google also has a few tricks up its sleeve.\n\nGoogle has just announced the launch of MediaPipe Objectron, its mobile technology for detecting 3D objects in real-time, allowing the smartphone to recognize an object\u2019s size and orientation, opening several application doors.\n\n(MTheiler), CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhat is Object Detection?\n\nHumans\u2019 intrinsic ability to rapidly detect, differentiate, and classify objects allows us to make quick decisions regarding what we see.\n\nDetection of objects in images remains one of the most significant challenges in the field of computer vision since objects found in images can be perceived from the most diverse viewpoints and transformations in size and rotation, making it more difficult to detect.\n\nDigital cameras provide good advantages among the critical sensors that AI can use: they can be lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, essential for some environments.\n\nTo achieve object detection goals, methods for the extraction of image information, visual attention models, and bio-inspired learning models have been studied to identify and classify vehicles.\n\nObject detection is crucial for good object recognition. A classification technique is to formulate it as a classification problem. Objects are instances with well-defined limits and center, unlike the background.\n\nMethods for detecting and recognizing objects require fewer resources to perform rapid detection due to the increased computational cost. The advanced and complex classifier, such as the CNN \u2014 Convolutional Neural Network, is necessary to obtain high accuracy in the Detections.\n\nDetection theories can be used to classify small, low cost or low consumption, electronics, transportation, health, safety, among other areas.\n\nAphex34, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe CNN Object Detection problem\n\nThe difference between object classification methods (like the networks in the previous section) and object detection methods is that in object detection, you want to:\n\nidentify how many objects of a given category are in the image;\n\nobjects of a given category are in the image; identify where in the image each object is located.\n\nIt is typically not known in advance how many instances of a given object category you will identify in a scene. If you were to build a standard CNN to solve this problem, you would have the following situation: the output size is variable. It depends on how many instances of an object you will find and where they are, which is impossible on a network with an output layer of fixed size. For this, models such as R-CNN and YOLO were developed.\n\nR-CNN: Regions with CNN feature\n\nR-CNN performs segmentation based on the results of object detection. R-CNN initially uses selective search to extract many candidates and then calculates its characteristics through CNN. Finally, it classifies each region using a specific linear classifier, usually SVM (support vector machines). Unlike the networks discussed in the previous section, R-CNN can perform more complex tasks, such as object detection and coarse segmentation of images. An R-CNN can be built on traditional image classification networks, such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.\n\nR-CNN solves the problem of multiple exits using a selective search as follows:\n\n1. Generate initial sub-segmentation; we generate many candidate regions\n\n2. Use a greedy algorithm to combine similar regions into larger ones recursively\n\n3. Use the generated regions to produce the final candidate region proposals\n\nR-CNN initially generates around 2000 candidates using the above algorithm based on simple traditional computer vision techniques. From there:\n\nEach candidate is reformatted to a standard size square image; Image is fed to a neural network that generates 4096-dimension feature vectors as output; An SVM classifies the vector of characteristics producing two outputs: a rating an offset indication that can be used to adjust the bounding box.\n\nDisadvantages of the model:\n\nSlow to train: training is in two stages; Very slow to execute: for each image, R-CNN first classifies 2000 sub-images.\n\nFast-R-CNN: Fast Region-based Convolutional Networks for object detection\n\nIn an article the following year, the authors of R-CNN presented a solution that solves the problems of slowness in the approach based on the analysis of 2000 semi-random images of R-CNN: convolutional preprocessing.\n\nInstead of feeding the neural network with candidate images, the entire image is provided to the network to generate a convolutional feature map ( CFM ). This CFM is then used to search for candidate regions, which are reformatted into fixed-size square images through a region-of-interest pooling layer ( RoI pooling ). From the characteristic vector generated for each RoI, a classification is performed with a softmax layer, which predicts the object category and associates it with the origin square\u2019s bounding box.\n\nThe graph below shows a comparison between the two approaches and another network from the same time, SPP-Net (Spatial Pyramid Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition) :\n\nFaster-R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks\n\nAgain, the same authors found a solution to make the network even faster was to eliminate the selective search for regions of interest. Similar to Fast R-CNN, the image is used directly as an input to generate a convolutional feature map. In this model, however, instead of performing a selective search on this map, a second, separate neural network is used to predict candidate regions. It is called the Region Proposal Network (RPN). RPN uses a neural mini-network based on a sliding window that analyzes the input image, and the translation is invariant. To avoid excessive proposals, suppression of non-maximums is carried out at this stage.\n\nThese candidate regions, like Fast-R-CNN, are reformatted into fixed-size square images through a region-of-interest pooling layer ( RoI pooling ). From the characteristic vector generated for each RoI, a classification is performed with a softmax layer, which predicts the object category and associates it with the bounding box given by the square of origin.\n\nThe image below shows a comparison between the three models of the authors and SPP-Net :\n\nSource: http://www.lapix.ufsc.br/ensino/visao/visao-computacionaldeep-learning/deteccao-de-objetos-em-imagens/?lang=en\n\nSingle Shot Detection Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Recognition\n\nThe above approaches use to focus on the sub-regions of the image to identify objects. The network never looks at the image as a whole. Here we will see approaches that consider the image as a whole.\n\nYou Only Look Once: YOLO\n\nIn YOLO, a single convolutional network predicts both the bounding boxes and the probabilities of belonging to each detected object\u2019s class. For this, YOLO works as follows:\n\nan image is taken and divided into an SxS grid of cells; using the grid as a reference, m bounding boxes are generated ; bounding boxes with a probability above a threshold are selected and used to locate the object within the image.\n\nMuch faster YOLO (45 fps on the authors\u2019 set -> up to two orders of magnitude) faster than contemporary algorithms. Its biggest flaw is inaccuracy with small objects in the image.\n\nEach cell in the grid can predict B bounding boxes ( bbox ) and C class probabilities. A bbox prediction has five components: (x, y, w, h, confidence). The coordinates (x, y) represent the center of the bbox relative to the location of the cell (if the center of a bbox does not fall into a cell, it will not be responsible for it and will not represent it -> cells only have a reference to objects whose center falls into them). These coordinates are normalized to [0, 1]. The bbox (w, h) dimensions are also normalized to [0, 1], relative to the image size.\n\nSuppose you split a 448 \u00d7 448-pixel image into a grid of SxS = 3 \u00d7 3 cells:\n\nIn YOLO, the concept of intersection over union (IoU) plays an important role: the confidence of a prediction in YOLO is given by Pr (Object) * IOU (pred, truth).\n\nDetecting 3D objects in real-time.\n\nWhile there are ample amounts of 3D data for street scenes, due to the popularity of research into self-driving cars that rely on 3D capture sensors like LIDAR, datasets with ground truth 3D annotations for more granular everyday objects are minimal. To overcome this problem, we developed a novel data pipeline using mobile augmented reality (AR) session data. With the arrival of ARCore and ARKit, hundreds of millions of smartphones now have AR capabilities and the ability to capture additional information during an AR session, including the camera pose, sparse 3D point clouds, estimated lighting, and planar surfaces.\n\nWe built a novel annotation tool for AR session data to label ground truth data, allowing annotators to label 3D bounding boxes for objects quickly. This tool uses a split-screen view to display 2D video frames on overlaid 3D bounding boxes on the left, alongside a view showing 3D point clouds, camera positions, and detected planes on the right. Annotators draw 3D bounding boxes in the 3D view and verify its location by reviewing the projections in 2D video frames. For static objects, we only need to annotate an object in a single frame and propagate its location to all frames using the ground truth camera pose information from the AR session data, making the procedure highly efficient.\n\nMediaPipe is Google\u2019s cross-platform framework for creating different data processing pipelines. Objetron is included within this framework as a moving pipeline for real-time 3D object detection.\n\nIn other words, Objectron detects objects through 2D images to later estimate their orientation and size through a machine learning model trained on a 3D data set. In other words, it is capable of detecting 3D objects from a single RGB image.\n\nBut understanding objects in 3D remains a challenging task due to the lack of large real-world datasets compared to 2D tasks (e.g., ImageNet, COCO, and Open Images).\n\nSo, to empower the research community for continued advancement in 3D object understanding, there is a strong need for the release of object-centric video datasets, which capture more of the 3D structure of an object, while matching the data format used for many vision tasks (i.e., video or camera streams), to aid in the training and benchmarking of machine learning models.\n\nThrough an encoder and decoder model, Google can convert a 2D input into a 3D output. A single image is enough.\n\nAt the basic structure level, the model has an encoder-decoder architecture based on MobileNetV2, Google\u2019s neural networks for classification and visual detection. Using these networks, the 2D projection of the image, and a 3D estimation algorithm, the model can process a 3D output of said object.\n\nTo mitigate possible fluctuations in the image, Google has worked under the same detection and tracking framework for its 2D objects. This translates into something that will already sound familiar to you if you know how Google works: image segmentation.\n\nThe original image is captured in 2D. Bounding boxes are applied to it for subsequent object detection. The object is detected by Gaussian distribution. The segmentation mask is applied.\n\nGoogle highlights that the model is so light that it can run in real-time at 26 FPS on a high-end mobile, specifically with the Adreno 650 (the GPU of the recent Snapdragon 865). The new solution is now available to anyone who wants to test it to develop new use cases and applications.\n\nThe Dataset\n\nThe Objectron dataset is a collection of short, object-centric video clips accompanied by AR session metadata that includes camera poses, sparse point-clouds, and characterization of the planar surfaces in the surrounding environment.\n\nIn each video, the camera moves around the object, capturing it from different angles. The data also contains manually annotated 3D bounding boxes for each object, which describe the object\u2019s position, orientation, and dimensions.\n\nThe dataset consists of 15K annotated video clips supplemented with over 4M annotated images in the following categories: bikes, books, bottles, cameras, cereal boxes, chairs, cups, laptops, and shoes. It is stored in the objectron bucket on Google Cloud Storage.\n\nAlong with the dataset, Google is also sharing a 3D object detection solution for four categories of objects \u2014 shoes, chairs, mugs, and cameras.\n\nThese models are released in MediaPipe, Google\u2019s open-source framework for cross-platform customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media, which also powers ML solutions like the on-device real-time hand, iris, and body pose tracking.\n\nBy releasing this Objectron dataset, Google hopes to enable the research community to push the limits of 3D object geometry understanding and foster new research and applications, such as view synthesis, improved 3D representation, and unsupervised learning.\n\nDataset Key Features\n\n15000 annotated videos and 4M annotated images\n\nAll samples include high-res images, object pose, camera pose, point-cloud, and surface planes.\n\nReady to use examples in various tf.record formats, which can be used in Tensorflow/PyTorch.\n\nObject-centric multi-views, observing the same object from different angles.\n\nAccurate evaluation metrics, like 3D IoU for oriented 3D bounding boxes.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Frank on Unsplash\n\nConclusion\n\nHumans\u2019 intrinsic ability to rapidly detect, differentiate, and classify objects allows us to make quick decisions regarding what we see.\n\nDetection of objects in images remains one of the most significant challenges in the field of computer vision since objects found in images can be perceived from the most diverse viewpoints and transformations in size and rotation, making it more difficult to detect.\n\nObject detection is crucial for good object recognition. There is a lot of excitement about this google release, especially considering that today there are powerful augmented reality platforms such as AR Core in Google and AR Kit in what refers to Apple.\n\nVideo games, applications, photography, video, and more can all benefit from object recognition.\n\nLet\u2019s keep one eye on this technology for future activities and developments by joining the Objectron mailing list and visiting Google\u2019s GitHub page.\n\nLinks\n\nReferences\n\nGoogle AI Blog \u2014 https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/11/announcing-objectron-dataset.html\n\nMediaPipe Objectron \u2014 https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/objectron\n\nFLODNet \u2014 Detec\u00e7\u00e3o e reconhecimento de objetos em dispositivos de baixa especifica\u00e7\u00e3o: um estudo de caso em classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de alimentos \u2014 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/303978504.pdf\n\nDeep Learning:: Object Detection in Images \u2014 http://www.lapix.ufsc.br/ensino/visao/visao-computacionaldeep-learning/deteccao-de-objetos-em-imagens/?lang=en",

        "text": "Just to be clear, I\u2019m not saying that writing every day is a bad thing, what I\u2019m saying is do what is sustainable, at whatever pace that works, for you. Whatever motivates you to write consistently and intentionally for weeks, months, years; instead of feeling success at your fingertips while burning yourself to the ground in the process. Do whatever makes you write better, and hopefully, forever. And no, you don\u2019t have to be miserable to be an artist. Be happier and healthier than that, your work, your body, and your mind will appreciate it.\n\nLet me be real with you, there are days I could hardly get to the shower, let alone sit down (or up?) and write 500 words. On those days, I could feel my anxiety so physically like an invisible rock clinging against my chest. Sometimes, it grows legs and moves up to my throat, preventing me from raising my already-stifled voice. On those days, I don\u2019t write despite the unbearable fear of me not working, not producing, not doing enough, not being enough. Because deep down, I know I write better when I\u2019m well-rested; when ideas flow from my mind onto the computer\u2019s screen without me having to think too hard about it.\n\nHave you done something and later you exclaim with pride and excitement mixed with a little of confusion \u201cI did that!?\u201d?. That\u2019s where you want to be, not grinding your words onto the page like a chore; which way of creating is gonna make you miserable at the end of the process.\n\nSo you know what? Binge that TV show. Finish the books that have been collecting dust on your slightly messy desk. Go out. Drink a cup of tea. Go hiking. Go to the gym. Go to the woods. Don\u2019t forget to take naps because naps are the best! Do whatever you need to cope as the kids say, and keep yourself healthy, mentally and physically. Self-care is your first and foremost responsibility, cliche as it sounds. If your creative career takes a bit longer to take off, that\u2019s okay. Because when you\u2019re not happy, what\u2019s the point of success? Success is the high you feel for 2 minutes (maybe a little more, or a little less, perhaps it\u2019ll last for days if you\u2019re lucky but eventually it\u2019ll fade) after you achieve the very thing you\u2019ve been trying to reach for years. Then there you are, alone yet again with your miserable self after the high subsides.\n\nDo you want to be happy with your success, or do you want to feel dead inside because you have nothing left to give?

        "title": "AI Unfolds the Science Behind a 50-Year-Old Protein-Folding Problem",
        "text": "DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold.\n\nThree decades after CASP issued its challenge to the scientific community, a most promising solution has surfaced using AI to predict the shapes of protein structures with accuracy that has yet to be seen. DeepMind, a company devoted to developing artificial intelligence systems to solve intelligence and advance scientific discovery, partnered with CASP to solve biology\u2019s grand challenge. AlphaFold is DeepMind\u2019s deep-learning system that has been proven to \u201caccurately predict the structure of proteins to within the width of an atom\u201d.\n\nAlphaFold was trained to analyze the structure of proteins using a databank of roughly 170,000 protein structures. During testing, AlphaFold achieved an average score of 92.4 GDT (Global Distance Test) in its predictions. The competitive threshold score: 90 GDT. This means that AlphaFold\u2019s abilities are easily competitive with the results obtained using experimental methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and x-ray crystallography. These experimental methods can take years to determine the shape of a protein. In contrast, AlphaFold can manage it in a few days. Achieving a score of over 90 reveals that any difference in the predicted and actual structure could be from experimental error in the experimental method \u2014 not the software. Alternatively, an error could predict an alternative protein configuration that could occur due to natural variation. The global distance test the results are based on is a scale of 0 to 100 which dictates how close the AI predicted structure is to the actual shape of the protein as determined from experimental methods.\n\nAlphaFold was able to predict the structure of proteins with a margin of error of 1.6 angstroms (0.16 nanometers). This is equivalent to roughly the width of an atom. AlphaFold was able to accomplish the unthinkable. While scientists can determine the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein, there are thousands (an understatement) of ways that a protein can fold to achieve a three-dimensional shape. Back in 1972, Christian Anfinsen won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for proving that protein shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. However, for the next 50 or so years, the scientific community had been grappling with trying to understand the shapes that proteins could fold into.\n\nAccording to DeepMind, their latest version of AlphaFold used in the recent CASP experiment was created using an attention-based neural network system. The system was trained end-to-end to be able to interpret the structure of a spacial graph which can be used to predict the shape of a folded protein. The system then goes on to reason over the implicit graph that it is building. AlphaFold \u201cuses evolutionarily related sequences, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and a representation of amino acid residue pairs to refine this graph.\u201d This iterative process allowed AlphaFold to develop solid predictions about the shape of a protein in as little as a few days. Finally, an internal confidence method in AlphaFold is used to determine which parts of the predicted protein shape are reliable.\n\nAlphaFold\u2019s ability to predict the shape of proteins has given new life to the study of diseases, something that has been thrust into the forefront of biology in the last year with a new urgency. DeepMind\u2019s technology could help virologists identify proteins that have become impaired to help understand how they interact in this new malfunctioning state. Success in this field could lead to more precise drug development, further insight into existing experimental methods, and hopefully the realization of more efficient treatments for a variety of diseases and viruses.\n\nDeepMind has even had the chance to use their AI in a real-world situation, having aided in early studies on the protein structures of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. AlphaFold was able to identify several related protein structures that had previously been unknown, helping scientists to better understand the nature of the virus.\n\nDeepMind is currently in the process of preparing a paper concerning their system that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.",

A notebook full of ideas from the writing residential you attended three years ago but fell out with one of your classmates, so you dare not look back there?\n\nIf you\u2019ve finished one story, I bet you have a store because the imagination is like a weed in its ability to spread all on its own, come sun or shade.

Yes, I\u2019m afraid so, but this one conveys how easy it is to discard goldmine ideas, and it\u2019s not about craft.\n\nIt\u2019s about Carrie, his first published novel. After his initial spark of inspiration for the story, he wrote a three-page first draft and promptly threw it in the bin, deciding he didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t worth wasting any more time on, and it would never sell.\n\nHis wife, curious about the crumpled pages protruding from his bin, took it out, read it and loved the story. She pushed him on, wanting to know what would happen next. And so he finished it, and you know the rest; he published his debut novel, was rescued from imminent poverty and forged a long successful career.\n\nThe takeaway features for un-repped/unpublished authors are;\n\n- It isn\u2019t easy to be objective about our work.\n\n- It is easy to abandon a story.\n\n- It\u2019s hard to spot the gold amongst the fog of endless rejections.\n\n- It\u2019s easy to lose inspiration.\n\n- The time when you\u2019re most likely to give up, the beginning, it\u2019s hardest to see the potential.\n\nPlus it feeds into my romantic view about the first draft of any story being a living, breathing thing in existence in the world. Long may this optimism last!\n\nWe need to take on the role of treasure hunter ourselves. Who uses a waste paper basket anymore? Here\u2019s my excavation process for seeking out the gold in the mountain of half-finished and forgotten stories that have amassed over the last seven years of writing.\n\n1. Storyhunting\n\nIt\u2019s time to get your gloves on and start exploring your spaces. Maybe you\u2019re all digital, lucky you! My handwriting days have left a chest full of notebooks and stolen A0 notepads. If this exercise is worth doing, it\u2019s worth doing correctly.\n\nMy creative cellar includes:\n\nOne Drive and old pc hard drives\n\nNotebooks\n\nEmails from course tutors\n\nCourse notes in hard and digital copy.\n\nIn this phase, you need to get them all into one place. Don\u2019t worry about reading them just yet. We\u2019re in the stock-take mode, and it\u2019s feeling good.\n\n2. Organising\n\nI\u2019ve come to the unfortunate realisation that amongst all of the character swashbuckling, living a Rimbaudian existence, research and inspiration chasing, the organising of any project is an essential part because without this you, you know, lose your stories!\n\nIt\u2019s time to note down the following:\n\nThe title, draft and date\n\nWhat was the inspiration?\n\nWho is your favourite character?\n\nWhat form is the story?\n\nFor this, you\u2019ll need a spreadsheet.\n\nIt\u2019s fun; you remember how much you\u2019ve got already and recall some of the adventures along the way.\n\n3. Reading\n\nThe thought of reading your old work might fill you with the dreads, but there are more upsides than down, as you\u2019ll discover.\n\nFor every cringe you sound out loud, you can also celebrate how much you\u2019ve learned and grown as a writer.\n\nBut more importantly, there is a reason you started this project. What was it? A person? An injustice? A character? A response to another piece of literature?\n\nFinding the spark of inspiration will be worth any pain you feel at the reminder of what an amateur writer you used to be.\n\nAs you go along make a note of the bits, you like. Maybe it\u2019s just a description of a bluebell woods; perhaps it\u2019s an antagonist or a brilliant line of dialogue. It\u2019s unlikely that you don\u2019t find something that\u2019s still breathing in each of your old stories.\n\n4. Repositioning\n\nNow you\u2019re familiar with your stories again, and you\u2019ve remembered what inspired you to write them in the first place is there a better way to tell the story? Maybe you\u2019ve written a stage play that would be better as a film script or even a short story. Perhaps a television idea you started penning would be better as a novel.\n\nWith everything you\u2019ve learned about storytelling, is there a better platform for your story?\n\nRemember that the options are endless:\n\nFlash fiction, microfiction, novella, novels, films, radio plays, stage plays, short film, web series, series.\n\nAn old playwriting tutor once spelt this out for me, it might seem obvious to you but here goes,\n\nThe written word of novels and short stories is best suited for exploring conflict that happens within the self.\n\nThe stage is best suited for exploring the conflict between people.\n\nFilm is best suited for exploring the conflict between people and their world.\n\nA few repositioning questions; is your story in its best format? Is your main character a dynamic character, or is there someone else who can take the protagonist spot?\n\nA tutor at a workshop once said to me that the biggest problem he saw with scripts was that it was full of characters that had situations put onto them; instead of characters that created their conditions.\n\n5. Big Picture\n\nNow you\u2019ve changed or confirmed the landing for your story, how are you going to get there? What\u2019s the most astonishingly extraordinary thing that could happen to this story? Then turn it into action like you would for one of your characters.\n\nThink big; try the +10 rule. You lost the idea the first time around; this time, you need to go bigger.\n\nWhat actions do you need to take to make this happen? List everything \u2014 cleaning your desk, finishing up a project to allow time for this one, eating more beans, getting rid of the energy demons in your life.\n\nDestroy all obstacles in the way of you and your story\u2019s bigger picture.\n\n6. Action Plan\n\nThe action plan is the most straightforward step of all. You\u2019ve got your vision; add a date, add milestones and list teeny steps you need to take to complete the task. Example steps might include finding a publishing platform, sending a nice email to a friend who might be kind enough to read your story \u2014 think meta!\n\nHere\u2019s an old blog about action planning your screenplay rewrite; the process will be the same.\n\nProgramme your plan onto a spreadsheet with a column or reporting function to close items out as you go along.",

        "text": "Sub-species\n\nThe Electrophysiologist\n\nThe recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other Neuroscientus by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.\n\nThe Systems Neuroscientist\n\nDistinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain \u2014 the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians \u2014 to yet others that identify with the type of brain \u2014 the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.\n\nInsufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (\u201cwe\u2019re a real science now\u201d), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these \u201cmulti-electrode recording\u201d and \u201ccalcium imaging\u201d, respectively).\n\nThe Cognitive Neuroscientist\n\nThis subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:\n\nNeuroimager \u2014 often referred to by other subspecies as \u201ca psychologist with a magnet\u201d, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to \u201cBonferroni\u201d, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase \u201cdead salmon\u201d. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.\n\nScalp tickler \u2014 a \u201cpsychologist with a hairnet\u201d, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. \u201cP100\u201d, \u201cN2\u201d), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.\n\nThe Paddlers \u2014 believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).\n\nThe Neuroanatomist\n\nWas thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.\n\nNeural Engineer\n\nConsider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.\n\nBehavioural Neuroscientist\n\nAttempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: \u201cthe US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact\u201d).\n\nNeuroethologist\n\nAttempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.\n\nNeuroendocrinologist\n\nSlightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn\u2019t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a \u201craster plot\u201d is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.\n\nMolecular neuroscientist\n\nApplies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other. Unable to distinguish the brain from the liver without assistance.\n\nNeurogeneticist\n\nObsessed with the expression of bits of DNA and RNA in brain cells. Unable to distinguish the brain from yeast without assistance.\n\n\n\nClinical Neuroscientist\n\nHaughty and proud, these interact the most with Homo sapiens, bringing their skills to treat the damaged and sick among that closely-related species. Males of this sub-species are thought to be born wearing a suit and tie.\n\nComputational Neuroscientist\n\nOften gaunt, frequently shunning daylight, these shy creatures have also a number of distinctive breeds. Recent gene sequencing work on this sub-species has revealed evidence of lateral gene transfer from known species of Physicists, Mathematicians, and Computer Scientists. The consequent melange of languages spoken among members of this sub-species often collapses interactions into mutual bafflement.\n\nCircuit modeller \u2014 Literal-minded to a fault, these build exact scale models of bits of brain. Often try to show them to their fellow Systems Neuroscientists working on the same bit of brain, but suffer frequent barbs and social rejection (\u201cSuited for a more specialist journal\u201d).\n\nThe Algorithmics \u2014 Seek the Holy Grail of the step-by-step instructions by which the brain works. Once discovered that deep-lying neurons, which may or may not contain dopamine, send a signal that looked like the difference: [actual value of what happened] \u2014 [predicted value of what happened]. Have been banging on about it for the past 25 years.\n\nCompartmentalist \u2014 Uses a thousand equations to describe a single neuron, none of whose parameters are experimentally determined. Often found weeping silently into a drink at conference bars. Worship at the Church of Rall.\n\nThe Bayesians \u2014 Have discovered a hammer, and are determined to use it on absolutely bloody anything that\u2019s not already nailed down.\n\nKarl Friston\n\nUnclassifiable.",

        "text": "1. Time management is squeezing blood from a stone\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only 24 hours in a day,\u201d people say. They think that means you should get as much as you can from each of those hours.\n\nWhat that actually means is there\u2019s a limit to the time you can save. Time management is squeezing blood from a stone.\n\n2. We\u2019re entering the creative age\n\nAccording to Kai-Fu Lee, AI and automation are poised to take forty- to fifty- percent of jobs in the next couple decades.\n\nBut not all jobs will disappear at the same rate. Jobs that require creativity will be out of reach for AI.\n\nWe\u2019re entering the Creative Age.\n\n3. Creative thinking is different from other thinking\n\nWe know thanks to the work of neuroscientists John Kounios and Mark Beeman that creative thinking is a unique type of thinking.\n\nCreative thinking is promoted by a positive mood and relaxation.\n\nThe creative state is also a fragile state. It\u2019s hard to get into, easy to get out of.\n\nHere\u2019s what the moment of insight looks like in the brain.\n\nAnimation by John Kounios and Mark Beeman (Northwestern/Drexel)\n\n4. You\u2019re most creative when you\u2019re least sharp\n\nWe each have our \u201cpeak\u201d and \u201coff-peak\u201d times of day.\n\nCounterintuitively, the science shows you\u2019re most creative during your off-peak time of day.\n\nIf you\u2019re groggy in the morning, don\u2019t reach for coffee first thing: That grogginess is a creative gift.\n\n5. Creative work happens in stages\n\nA great idea doesn\u2019t mean your idea is ready to ship. There are four stages of creativity:\n\n1. Preparation: Learn about the problem\n\n2. Incubation: Let it sink in\n\n3. Illumination: Have the idea\n\n4. Verification: Get it ready to ship\n\nRespect these stages, don\u2019t get blocked.\n\n6. Not all hours are equal\n\nSome hours are great for having ideas \u2014 other hours are great for executing on those ideas.\n\nDan Ariely and I noticed working on Timeful (Google acquired) there aren\u2019t 24 hours in the day \u2014 there\u2019s an hour here or there for each type of thinking.\n\nHere\u2019s what the late, great, Anders Ericsson saw when he looked at the practice schedules of the very best violinists: Intense practice in the morning. Sporadic practice the rest of the day.\n\nRedrawn (by the author) and adapted from \u201cThe Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance,\u201d Ericsson et al., 1993.\n\n7. The world works in cycles\n\nYou can work with cycles in your world to propel your ideas forward.\n\nDays, weeks, seasons, and years can be harnessed to cycle through the Four Stages of Creativity.\n\nFor example, you can use a night\u2019s rest, a relaxing weekend, or a cozy winter as Incubation:",

        "title": "How to Write a Dynamite Pitch For Your Guest Post",
        "text": "How to Write a Dynamite Pitch For Your Guest Post\n\nGet your words in front of thousands at lightning speed\n\nPhoto by Nainoa Shizuru on Unsplash\n\nDo you want to be famous?\n\nI\u2019m not talking about being so famous you can\u2019t go to the grocery store without a team of bodyguards. But if that\u2019s what you want, more power to you!\n\nI\u2019m talking about credibility. You get that by being known as an authority in your niche. When you achieve that status, you become a go-to guide people turn to when they\u2019re looking for the latest and best insights in the business you\u2019re in.\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be great?\n\nGuest posting is a fantastic way to give your message the boost it needs.\n\nSo how do you approach an Influencer?\n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cWho am I to ask the biggest blogger I know to let me write for them?\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m about to say will encourage you and maybe even shock you.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter who you are.\n\nIf you have a great idea for a post that will make an Influencer look good, they\u2019ll be glad to hear it. And more importantly, if your idea lifts their audience to a higher level of performance, you\u2019ll have your best shot ever of getting your foot in the door.\n\nJust make sure it\u2019s original, inspiring, and useful.\n\nHere\u2019s what most people do wrong.\n\nIf you want to get ignored, do this.\n\nTalk about yourself. Focus on your own needs. Tell the Influencer that using her platform will really help your career take off.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t care what you want.\n\nWhat she cares about is her agenda.\n\nDo you know what it is?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to figure out.\n\nAsk yourself why you read her blog every week. Think about some of the wins you got reading her posts. Are they inspiring? Useful? What is her writing style? Does she have a lot of other voices contributing to the conversation?\n\nThe more you know, the better your pitch will be.\n\nThink about it. This blog is big and popular because the Blogger was intentional about it. She has a clear mission and she dedicates all her efforts to promoting it. She\u2019s not going to let just anybody come in and blow it all. Writing for her is a privilege, not a God-given right.\n\nRemember that, and you\u2019ll be much more successful getting a guest spot.\n\nUse This Template and You\u2019ll Maximize Your Chances of Getting a Yes.\n\nMake sure your pitch is short, friendly, and direct.\n\nInfluencers are busy. They probably have assistants reading their emails. And if you think your inbox is crowded, multiply that times a thousand for them.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got to stand out.\n\nFirst and always, follow the guidelines.\n\nMost bloggers who accept guest posts will spell out what they want. They\u2019ll tell you what topics they\u2019re looking for, how long the posts should be, and what style of writing they publish.\n\nI know sometimes it\u2019s okay to break the rules when you write. Don\u2019t make it these rules.\n\nRules are a screen as much as resum\u00e9s are for job applicants. If you satisfy enough of the criteria, your submission won\u2019t get tossed out. If you exceed what\u2019s expected and offer something that wows them, you\u2019re almost assured of getting a shot at a guest post.\n\nUse a proven template to pitch.\n\nWe said before to make your pitch short, friendly, and direct.\n\nShort means 3 paragraphs max. No more than 5\u20136 sentences total. Any longer and everything you did to make them happy before won\u2019t mean a thing.\n\nLine 1 \u2014 Compliment them.\n\nDon\u2019t be vague here. Tell them something specific, like,\n\n\u201cI loved your post last week on how to break bad habits for good. It was a game changer for me, helping me quit smoking after being hooked for 30 years.\u201d\n\nAnd be sure you\u2019re honest here. If you can give them a specific example of how it helped, that\u2019s much better than the generic phrase everyone uses:\n\nI love your work.\n\nSo dig deep if you must, and be specific. It will make you stand out from the other form submissions they\u2019re getting.\n\nLine 2 \u2014 Make your proposal.\n\nDo you see a gap you can fill with your wisdom? Is there a question in the comments somewhere that didn\u2019t get answered well enough? Can you see something on the horizon in your industry that no one else is seeing or talking about yet?\n\nMake your proposal in a sentence or two. Only make it longer if the guidelines specify that you should. The point here is that if you can capture your idea in one sentence, the rest of the writing will come a lot easier.\n\nAnd more importantly, it will be laser-focused.\n\nBe sure to make your proposal clear so the reader understands it as well as you do. In fact, it should be so clear that it can pass the test of a casual glance. Remember, the person who reads your email is busy. She won\u2019t work to figure out what you meant. So be clear right from the start.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure its clear, ask your friends and colleagues if they understand what you want to write.\n\nLine 3 \u2014 Thank them again.\n\nThis is simple courtesy. Tell them you appreciate their consideration and hope to hear from them. But even if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll still be a fan.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nWhat to do if it\u2019s rejected.\n\nSometimes you might offer something they have enough of already.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. Read the blog every time they publish something new. Go back as far as you can into the archives to see where they\u2019ve gone over time.

        "text": "Amazon, Google and Apple Recently Enabled Their Products To \u201cListen\u201d for These 3 Reasons\n\niPhone, Apple Watch and Pixel Buds- What you can do with their new sound detection features\n\nHumans are born to detect threats by staying alert to sounds.\n\nWe get nervous when we hear footsteps walking behind us in a dark street. We are all ears and alert when we are about to go to bed and hear something outside the bedroom.\n\nWith limited sight at night, or at home alone, we often depend solely on sounds to understand the surroundings.\n\nBut what about when we are distracted? Can you hear the door knock when you are listening to music wearing big headphones? Or how do I know the car behind me honked to warn me of approaching with my noise cancelling mode on? What about for those who have hearing loss? What if I want to know if my dog barks and upset my neighbors while I\u2019m away?\n\nBig tech companies have come up with solutions to these problems thanks to the recent breakthroughs with sound AI technology \u2014 and now they are able to build these Machine learning-based sound detection features into their devices as small as earbuds.\n\nStarting from 2019, Amazon, Google and Apple have competitively released sound detection features, mainly for these three purposes.\n\n#1. Home security: Smart speakers can listen for suspicious activities while you are away\n\nIn May 2019, Amazon rolled out Alexa Guard, enabling Amazon Echo speakers to transition into Guard Mode by saying a command like \u201cAlexa, I\u2019m leaving\u201d.\n\nIf sounds like glass break, CO alarm or human activity including footfalls or door opening is detected, it will send a notification to your phone. You can also configure it to lock any doors with compatible smart locks, or deter unwanted visitors by turning on/off lights to make it appear as if you\u2019re home, sound dog barking sound or a siren when activity is detected. Similarly, in November 2019, Google released glass break detection for its smart speaker, Nest Secure.\n\nIn fact, sound recognition technology applied to home security is not a brand-new concept. Prior to the deep-learning based sound detection method like the example of Alexa Guard, a rule-based sound detection method had been used conventionally, which basically recognizes sound by loudness and magnitude of frequency. Traditional glass break detectors or smoke alarm detectors are built with this rule-based technology.\n\n\u201cRule-based\u201d system, as its name implies, is confined by knowledge and rules given manually by human. As a result, it was not useful for complex environment where there were high frequency of exceptional patterns and thus, had poor performance.\n\nModern deep-learning based models on the other hand, doesn\u2019t depend on given knowledge because it can continue learning on its own, constantly optimizing itself by adapting to changes and hidden patterns, resulting in incomparably better performance compared to the rule-based one.\n\n#2. Safety: Your wearable will make sure you don\u2019t miss a thing!\n\nSmartphone manufacturers are constantly producing wearable and accessories to upsell with their smartphones.\n\nAmong them, wireless earbuds, since the launch of AirPods 1, have been a huge hit, and report says Apple alone has sold nearly 60 million AirPods. Airpods users love the Noise cancelling function, introduced with AirPods Pro, \u201ccancels\u201d the external sound before it could make you feel as if you are isolated from outside world.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a cool function, noise cancelling presents high risk of accidents by nature. If you are a cyclist or drive frequently, chances are you have encountered a passenger with earbuds who\u2019s totally unaware of your bicycle bells or car honks. Some states in the US have introduced laws to forbid drivers to wear headphones or earbuds while driving.\n\nAware of this danger earbuds could bring, earbuds makers have been devising ways to avoid this danger. Google\u2019s Pixel Buds have brought Attention Alerts in August 2020. If a baby cries nearby or an emergency vehicle passes by with its siren on, the Pixel Buds will automatically lower the volume temporarily so you can hear what\u2019s happening around you.\n\nAdditionally, Apple Watch added another creative and well-timed safety measure amid the pandemic \u2014 the hand washing timer. With this feature enabled, Apple Watch listens for water running sound, and will automatically display 20 seconds countdown for proper hand washing.\n\n#3. Accessibility: Designed to assist with your daily lives\n\nHearing loss is a common problem caused by noise, aging, disease, and heredity. Globally, there are 466-million people suffering from some level of hearing loss.\n\nHearing loss hugely impacts daily life in many ways. Take for example, sounds they are likely to miss out due to hearing loss \u2014 when you forget to turn off the water faucet, you can\u2019t hear the constantly running water. No beep from the oven telling you your food is ready. Can\u2019t tell if the smoke alarm went off. Missing out their babies crying, murmuring, and giggling\u2026 all these are huge pain they have to live with.\n\nThese people could hugely benefit from the sound detection technology if their mobile devices could capture the sound for them and give them notifications. Apple and Google were the first to add this feature into their smartphones, and users can configure sounds they want to detect under Accessibility setting \u2014 iOS 14 Sound Recognition (updated in September 2020) and Android Sound Notifications (updated in October 2020) respectively.\n\niOS users can set their devices to constantly listen for 11 sounds and receive alerts when these sounds are detected.The sounds are categorized as follows:\n\n\u2022Alarms: Fire, Siren, Smoke\n\n\u2022Animals: Cat, Dog\n\n\u2022Household: Appliances, Car Horn, Door Bell, Door Knock, Water Running\n\n\u2022People: Baby Crying\n\nAndroid users can likewise detect 11 sounds including shouting and landline phone ringing.\n\nTech companies see accessibility as one of its core values and they put in a ton of work in assistive technology in order to ensure everyone can use their devices in the best ways to suit them. Some accessibility features such as VoiceOver (screen reader) or Voice Control, originally designed and developed with accessibility in mind, were adopted by mainstream after many people found value in these features. Sound detection too, will turn out to be useful for many people in general if smartphones could recognize diverse sounds and help them understand their surroundings better.\n\nProgressing towards a smarter future\n\nAs it\u2019s a growing market in the early stage, tech giants saw huge potential in the sound AI technology and started in investing in the field.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest annual workshop in the sound AI research field, IEEE DCASE (Workshop on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events), which used to be a flagship event mainly for academia, recently gained FAANG\u2019s attention. In 2019, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and IBM sponsored DCASE, and Apple joined in the following year.\n\nPredominant application for sound AI technology until now would be a simple sound recognition, like what Apple, Google and Amazon has built so far. What\u2019s bound to come in the next few years however, is much more than that.\n\nResearchers have spent a great deal of time studying how electronic devices can be augmented with sensors that allow them to perceive their environment. This body of work, often referred to as context-aware, stems from the idea that in order to build large-scale ubiquitous systems, individual devices must be aware of their environment (e.g. where they are, what is happening, where something is happening). Based on such information, applications and devices can make decisions proactively.\n\nSounds provide countless contextual information. Imagine what it would be like if devices could process perceive their surroundings by sound. Your cars could tell whether you are passing by a highway or crowded street, or forest surrounded by birds chirping, and change driving mode accordingly. Security cameras catch violent noise and spot a crime. Smart lamps knows you fell asleep and turn off the light. Autonomous car, smart city, home automation and healthcare \u2014 expansion of context-aware sound applications could be exponential.\n\nWith the speed of the research advancement in the field, context-aware sound applications will boom in the very near future. So let\u2019s tune in and see what\u2019s coming!",

        "text": "ew things affect our productivity as much as what we surround ourselves with. Yet most of us rarely take the time to step back and really analyze our working environment.\n\nInstead, we take a \u2018set it and forget it\u2019 approach to where we work.\n\nWe go to the same office, the same coffee shop, the same co-working space and try to force ourselves into a productive flow. Since going remote a year and a half ago while working at Crew I\u2019ve fallen into this mindset more times than I\u2019d like to admit.\n\nSo I started to ask: If we\u2019re going to spend so much of our lives working, why not try to make the place we work the best it possibly can be?\n\nWhether you\u2019re at home, in a shared space, or hanging out a coffee shop there are quick and easy fixes to help make your work space work for you.\n\nWhy our environment matters (even when we don\u2019t notice)\n\nYou may think that you\u2019ve got a good set up, but read into the ways that our surroundings affect us on a subconscious level and you\u2019ll start to feel pretty uneasy about your environment.\n\nStudies have shown how our working habits, both good and bad, are often related to some sort of external trigger or cue, which researchers are increasingly tying to our surroundings. We visit the same places, work at the same desk, and are constantly surrounded by the same influencing factors.\n\nWhich is great, right? Find a good working environment and you\u2019ll be forced into a state of flow. But unfortunately, like most things to do with how our brains work, there\u2019s so much more beneath the surface.\n\nAs we evolved, our subconscious brain has been trained to keep us safe, even when we don\u2019t realize it. When we\u2019re under threat we need to make decisions quickly, which our brain does through something called \u2018thin slicing\u2019. This means it takes one small element of reality and generalizes it, and from that it will determine what behavior to adopt.\n\nSo those triggers and cues in your workspace aren\u2019t just affecting you in a way you can consciously comprehend, they\u2019re changing the way your subconscious brain thinks and acts.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Here\u2019s some studies that show just how ridiculously powerful our environment is in changing the way we think and act:\n\nStudents holding a hot cup of coffee for a few seconds before being asked to judge a hypothetical person, were more likely to describe them as warm and friendly than those holding an iced coffee\n\nPeople will behave more competitively if there\u2019s a briefcase in sight \u2014 or even if there\u2019s a picture of a briefcase on the wall. And this happens even when people have no conscious memory of having seen the briefcase afterwards.\n\nIf you talk to someone who consistently uses words like down, depressed, low, pointless, and disappointed you\u2019re likely to feel the same way\n\nEven the subtle aroma of cleaning liquid in the air causes people to be perceptibly cleaner and tidier than usual\n\nSo how do we create an environment that\u2019s optimal for making us feel the way we want to during the working day: motivated, productive, and creative?\n\nKill the clutter before it kills you\n\nThere is a long history of creatives and thinkers with cluttered desks. As Albert Einstein once so eloquently put it:\n\n\u201cIf a cluttered desk signs a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?\u201d\n\nHowever, whether it\u2019s your closet or office desk, excess things in your surroundings can have a negative impact on your ability to focus and process information.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what neuroscientists at Princeton University found when they looked at people\u2019s task performance in an organized versus disorganized environment. The results of the study showed that physical clutter in your surroundings competes for your attention, resulting in decreased performance and increased stress.\n\nA team of UCLA researchers recently observed 32 Los Angeles families and found that all of the mothers\u2019 stress hormones spiked during the time they spent dealing with their belongings.\n\nSimilar to what multitasking does to your brain, physical clutter overloads your senses, making you feel stressed, and impairs your ability to think creatively.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not as easy as just getting rid of the excess things in your life. We don\u2019t create clutter simply through laziness or being unorganized, it literally hurts your brain to give them up.\n\nResearchers at Yale recently identified that two areas in your brain associated with pain, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, light up in response to letting go of items you own and feel a connection towards:\n\nThis is the same area of the brain that lights up when you feel physical pain from a paper cut or drinking coffee that\u2019s too hot.\n\nYour brain views the loss of one of your valued possessions the same as something that causes you physical pain.\n\nSo what do we do to reduce the stress of clutter?\n\nApply constraints: Whether that\u2019s Twitter followers, tabs open in your browser, notebooks, or magazines, setting hard limitations and sticking to them is the best way to stop accumulating more.\n\nWhether that\u2019s Twitter followers, tabs open in your browser, notebooks, or magazines, setting hard limitations and sticking to them is the best way to stop accumulating more. Use small storage spaces: Parkinson\u2019s Law says we fill the time we have available to us, and the same could be said about clutter. Less room means less room for clutter.\n\nParkinson\u2019s Law says we fill the time we have available to us, and the same could be said about clutter. Less room means less room for clutter. Conduct a monthly review of your space: Set time aside to clean, sort, and discard every single month.\n\nSet time aside to clean, sort, and discard every single month. Set up a daily cleanse routine: Crew CEO Mikael suggests cleaning your desktop at the end of every workday so to-do items don\u2019t linger and you\u2019ve got a clean slate to start with the next day\n\nFind places that inspire you\n\nThere\u2019s a reason we feel inspired by large spaces or refreshed from sitting by the window. Apart from a heavy dose of Vitamin D, architecture can have a huge impact on our productivity.\n\nAuthor James Clear gives the example of researcher Jonas Salk, who, after spending years trying to discover the cure for the polio epidemic ravaging the US in the 50s, travelled to the quiet hills of central Italy where he stayed at a 13th-century Franciscan monastery known as the Basilica of San Francesco d\u2019Assisi.\n\nThe space changed the way he thought:\n\n\u201cThe spirituality of the architecture there was so inspiring that I was able to do intuitive thinking far beyond any I had done in the past. Under the influence of that historic place I intuitively designed the research that I felt would result in a vaccine for polio. I returned to my laboratory in Pittsburgh to validate my concepts and found that they were correct.\u201d\n\nJonas\u2019 example is just one of many.\n\nIt\u2019s been long known that schools with more natural light provide a better learning environment for students and test scores often go up as a result. And natural light and fresh air are known to stimulate productivity in the workplace as well.\n\nYou might not be in a position to choose your workspace, but there are quick fixes: look for a spot with natural light from a window or skylight; take a walk outside when you feel stuck; or simply explore a new location.\n\nA new environment can quite literally lead to new ideas. And what\u2019s even more exciting is that studies have shown it\u2019s actually easier to build new habits in new places.\n\nUse different places for different places of mind\n\nWe know that different locations will affect us, so why not use that to our advantage?\n\nOur brains love habits, and if we can associate certain qualities with different places, it can help us get into a better working flow. This is called \u2018task association\u2019, where your brain knows that when you\u2019re in a certain place, you\u2019re taking a certain action.\n\nWriter Gregory Ciotti gives one great example of how he forces himself into a better working flow just by changing the device he\u2019s using. In his example, he\u2019s trained his brain to know that when he\u2019s at his desktop it\u2019s time for deep writing like articles. The laptop is for more shallow work like emails or informal posts. And lastly, the tablet is for reading only.\n\nThis technique is so powerful it\u2019s even been used to help treat people with insomnia by telling them to only go into their bedroom if they\u2019re actually tired. If sleep isn\u2019t achieved in a reasonable amount of time, they were instructed to leave and move onto another task until they were tired again.\n\nIf you can set up multiple workspaces for different tasks you\u2019ll also be able to force your mind into a certain flow, just by physically being somewhere.\n\nA great example of this is writer and artist Austin Kleon who keeps two desks setup in his space: an \u2018analog\u2019 desk filled with paper, pens, and markers; and a \u2018digital\u2019 desk with laptop and tablet. Idea creation and \u2018playing\u2019 takes place on only the analog desk, while shaping, editing, and publishing is in the digital domain.\n\nSet yourself up for success\n\nWe may think we have the willpower and control to push through harder tasks, but deep down we\u2019re all lazy. But it\u2019s not entirely our fault. Our brains have been taught to conserve energy at all costs and make subconscious decisions for us based entirely on how hard or easy it is.\n\nSo if you want to create a workspace that\u2019s productive, focus on making it easier to do the things you want to do, and harder to do the tasks you don\u2019t.\n\nStanford professor and psychologist BJ Fogg calls this \u2018designing for laziness\u2019.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s as easy as turning your phone off and putting it in a drawer so every time you\u2019re tempted to check it you have to go through a lengthy process, while other times it might mean unplugging your TV and putting it in the closet.\n\nOne technique I\u2019ve used lately is to close all of my tabs in my browser at the end of the day (a hellish chore for any writer), leaving only my most important task open. The next day, the easiest choice is just to keep working on whatever was left from the day before.\n\nI\u2019m certainly not the first person to use this technique. Even Hemingway used to stop writing mid-sentence so that he always knew where to pick up the next day.\n\nCurate your senses\n\nBeyond the physical layout and mental associations of your space, there are some auxiliary things you can also control. The sounds around you and the music you listen to can have a huge impact on your productivity.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about the power of music and how to find the right track for the right task before, but it\u2019s important to note that certain sounds can be incredibly harmful to how you work.\n\nStudies show that of all things, intermittent speech \u2014 hearing small snippets of conversation \u2014 can have an incredibly negative impact on your ability to concentrate.\n\nOne meta-analysis examined 242 studies of the ways noise affects performance, and found that when it came to performing cognitive tasks \u2014 like staying attentive, reading and processing text, and working with numbers \u2014 performance was more affected by intermittent speech than by either continuous speech (which would have little variation in volume and rhythm) or non-speech noise.\n\nBad news for those of us in shared spaces or offices.\n\nThere are options though. If you can\u2019t find a spot that\u2019s silent, noise cancelling headphones or music that drowns out speech can help regain that focus.",

        "title": "You Should Be Writing",
        "text": "So many of the questions that these writers have can be resolved with this simple two step process:\n\nRead a lot of things. Going off what you\u2019ve read, write.\n\nHow do you format a novel? Read a novel, and follow the formatting that they use.\n\nDo you use paragraph breaks whenever a new character starts speaking? Crack open all of the books around you, and see how many of them do that. Chances are, most of them do. So it\u2019s a pretty good idea.\n\nHow do you write a good starship captain? Go to Netflix, start watching Star Trek: The Next Generation, and start writing.\n\nOkay, that one was kind of facetious. (Not really. Picard is the best.)\n\nBut still, you go out and, throughout your life, you observe things. You read books that are formatted correctly. You read novels and watch movies and TV shows with tingly, tense scenes. You watch all of the starship captains and you decide which ones are good (Jean Luc Picard and Kathryn Janeway) and you make your captain have some of their traits, and some traits from people that you admire, and you have them respond to the stresses of your story and you watch them play.\n\nYou write. And, probably, write poorly.\n\nBut then you read more and watch more, and learn more. You grow as a human being. Maybe you take some writing classes. Maybe you get some help from a published writer, who\u2019ll leave helpful notes, like this actual note I got from actual author Heather Petty, on my first novel:\n\nBut none of that happens until you actually write the damn thing.\n\nSo you put the Quora away. You swallow back the worst of your questions \u2014 no matter how hard it is. No matter how much you want to do it right on the first time.\n\nThat\u2019s right. You procrastinate on those questions. You kick them down the line.\n\nYou stop worrying about it. And I know that\u2019s not an easy or passive thing. You have to continually stop worrying about it. You have to stop going back and revising and trying to make it perfect. You try to get it done.\n\nYou write.",

        "title": "Increase Your Reach by Differentiating Your Images from the Crowd",
        "text": "When it comes to images, using them throughout your blog posts can improve their overall look and performance.\n\nHere are five major benefits why you should be adding images to your blog posts.\n\n1. Posts with visuals are more appealing\n\nA picture is the best way to create a positive first impression of your post. When your post is visually dull and lacks emotions, a lot of visitors will just leave your website without reading a word.\n\nVisually attractive posts have more chances to create an emotional connection with readers. They look friendlier and more inviting to take action.\n\nWhen you add images to your blog posts, you help create a \u201cstory\u201d for that part of the blog. Visually appealing images keep your reader scrolling, and, as mentioned above, people are more likely to retain more information.\n\nThe right image can convey a strong message to a reader: a picture can be worth 1,000 words.\n\n2. Blogs with images get shared more on social media\n\nSocial media marketing is a vital part of spreading awareness about your content and increasing traffic to your business blog and website as a whole.\n\nWhen it comes to shared blogs on social media, articles that contain images actually get shared more, which can help drive more traffic to your site.\n\nStatistics from Search Engine Journal reveal that:\n\nBlog articles containing images receive 94% more views.\n\nTweets containing images are retweeted 150% more.\n\nFacebook posts with images receive three times more engagement.\n\n3. Another valuable skill to promote\n\nWhen the number of bloggers keep growing so quickly, you need something that could make you more skilled than others.\n\nYou can actually learn to do some simple designing tasks and your blog could become a good place to practice. Create some custom illustrations for your posts and build a portfolio of your artwork samples.\n\nYour readers might sooner or later notice that you create images yourself and they might eventually recognize you as a higher-profile blogger with some hands-on designing experience.\n\nIf you are selling blogging services, your customers would really appreciate hiring someone who is capable of creating custom images for them in addition to just writing.\n\n4. Images break up text into digestible chunks\n\nIn the same way people use paragraphs to separate points and make it easier for the reader to digest, people use images to separate points and make the text easier to understand.\n\nWhen they are presented with a wall of text, the first thing they\u2019ll do is try and find another source.\n\nEven if your wall of text isn\u2019t as long as other people\u2019s content if it looks too difficult to read, they\u2019re not going to bother.\n\nThink about the two blog posts. Even though the actual content is the same, the one with the images is infinitely easier to read and comprehend.\n\n5. Images can help boost your SEO\n\nBlog posts with appropriate images perform better in search engines.\n\nOne more hidden SEO benefit of images is that you can add alt text to them right in your content management system.\n\nBy following keyword best practices and adding your primary keywords to your alt text, you can boost your SEO. While readers aren\u2019t able to see the alt text you add to each image, search engines continuously crawl all the text within your blog article \u2014 including alt text.\n\nIt is a good way to populate your post with some relevant keywords that give it more chances to be seen. Make sure you compress and resize images to optimize them for search engines and faster loading.",

        "text": "Setting up a website is considered necessary for a variety of reasons. Every day, more than 547,000 new websites are created. Most of these are business and service-related, whether for rolling out a new startup, publishing a professional blog, setting up an online store, or even to introduce a non-profit organization. But what about creating a personal website?\n\nThere are numerous benefits to setting up a personal website. In fact, creating one is considered a necessity for many categories of people, including entrepreneurs, professionals in digital, media, entertainment, and creative fields, and even hobbyists. Yet, many decline to claim their personal space on the web. Often, it is not as a result of lacking the expertise. After all, these days, there are many ways to create a website without having to know a single thing about website development.\n\nThe issue is more about seeing the value in setting up a personal website. For example, many people think being on social media is sufficient. Having accounts with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. does connect you with the rest of the world. But the truth is, most people still search for stuff on Google, which is where having your own website truly becomes important. Not convinced?

        "title": "How to Make a Sticky Connection With Your Biggest Fans",
        "text": "We don\u2019t know where our first impressions come from or precisely what they mean, so we don\u2019t always appreciate their fragility.\n\n\u2014 Malcolm Gladwell\n\nFirst impressions matter, of course. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll find all kinds of advice about how to put your best foot forward as a writer. How to make your work look its best. How to properly format it for whoever you\u2019re sending it to, and for your readers.\n\nBut what comes next? First impressions, like Malcolm Gladwell said, might be fragile. But I think it\u2019s worse than that. I think they\u2019re often either transparent or slick.\n\nEither readers don\u2019t remember their first impression of us or they\u2019re drawn in by something, but the surface of the impression is too slippery to stick to them if it\u2019s challenged later.\n\nThe best we can hope for on first impression is that they\u2019ll come back. Read a little more. Or maybe just think about us again, when a friend needs a book to read. Remember us when they see our name again.\n\nIt\u2019s the second impression \u2014 the chance we get when someone comes back for a second look \u2014 that matters most. It\u2019s our opportunity to make a sticky connection with them. One that will make them remember us.\n\nHow we manage those followers who actually become fans is so important.\n\nI had this experience once.\n\nThere\u2019s an author I really admire. I read his newsletter. I own all of his books.\n\nI\u2019ve bought every single thing he\u2019s ever tried to sell me. And I\u2019ve hand sold his stuff all over creation. My first impression of him was lovely. Shiny and slick.\n\nI was going to be in his city a couple of years ago and we\u2019re colleagues enough that I decided to email and introduced myself. I told him I\u2019d love to buy him coffee.\n\nHe wrote back, several days later and said that he was sorry, but he\u2019d have to decline.\n\nOkay. He was under no obligation to meet me. His reply was polite. First impression intact.\n\nOne day, several months later, I checked my Amazon affiliate links and realized that I\u2019d hand sold more than 100 copies of his books that month. I wrote him again and told him that awesome news, showed him proof, and said that since my audience obviously loves him, I\u2019d love to interview him.\n\nCould I send him a few questions via email that he could answer at his leisure?\n\nHe wrote back, several days later and said that he was sorry, but he\u2019d have to decline.\n\nThe exact same email. Still polite, but now obviously a cut and paste, since I had two of them.\n\nNow, intellectually, I don\u2019t expect everyone (or anyone) to do what I want or I\u2019m going to hate them forever. He\u2019s a busy, famous dude. He gets to say no, period.\n\nBut I\u2019m human and I can\u2019t help that the tarnish is off the shine of that first impression. That\u2019s just the breaks.\n\nI started out feeling like this man\u2019s work was mine, in a small way, because I loved it so much. I had a connection to it that made me excited to spread the news about it. I shared it with people who trust me to send them to cool stuff, because it was sort of like sharing something of mine.\n\nI still appreciate his work, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s mine at all anymore. I was a kind of cosmic-level fan. Pat Flynn calls that a superfan.\n\nMy second impression of this author wasn\u2019t very sticky. I fact, my first impression was stickier. These days I\u2019m more of a regular fan.\n\nHere\u2019s another experience.\n\nI signed up for a program that I was excited about starting. It was an innovative kind of mastermind community that I\u2019d never really heard of before. I\u2019d been to a conference put on by the guys running the program and I was jazzed to be part of it.\n\nMy first impression, again, was pretty. Nice and shiny and slick.\n\nThe first couple of days were rocky. The program\u2019s owner had a thing about Facebook. He didn\u2019t like it. At all. But in the lead up the program starting, he\u2019d started a temporary Facebook group for people to start to get to know each other and it was really active and exciting.\n\nBut then he pulled the plug on it \u2014 deleted it completely \u2014 and moved to a forum on his own site. The forum was far less interactive and more slow paced. It was a complete dud. So, first impression was spotty at best.\n\nBut then I got an email from one of the guys who was running the program. In it was a one-minute welcome video where the man addressed me by name, talked specifically about why he was happy that I\u2019d joined his program and what he thought I\u2019d get out of it and how much he was looking forward to what I could bring to it.\n\nOne little video and suddenly I felt connected to the program again. I was willing to wait through the growing pains with the forum, at least for a little while.\n\nThat forum, btw, was the program\u2019s ultimate undoing I think. The momentum that started on Facebook never reignited. At least it didn\u2019t for me. But, because the person who\u2019d developed the program took the time to make a good second impression on me, when he had something else to offer years later, I was excited to take a look.\n\nMy second impression here was sticky. Even though the first thing I did with them didn\u2019t work out, they\u2019d made a fan.\n\nIt\u2019s the same for all kinds of marketing. Even for writers.\n\nWe have the chance to make a first impression, of course. We put our work out there. People read it and they enjoy it or they don\u2019t. They share it or they don\u2019t. They tell their friends about it or they don\u2019t.\n\nWe put our best foot forward and aim for those good, shiny first impressions.\n\nBut it\u2019s the second impression that matters even more. The second impression is what\u2019s really at the heart of marketing for writers. Those readers who are intrigued enough to come back or to reach out for a little more \u2014 they want to be inspired. They want a sticky experience.\n\nIf you give them a chance, they\u2019ll become your fan.\n\nMost of your readers won\u2019t give you the chance to have a sticky second-impression interaction with them. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s the way the game is played. Most will read and move on, and you\u2019ll never really know they were there beyond some statistic maybe.\n\nIf you think of your readers arranged in a pyramid, casual readers who only read something if they happen to come across it are at the bottom. A nice, sturdy base.\n\nBut some will seek you out on social media. Or they\u2019ll join your email list. Or they\u2019ll look for your next book. They\u2019ll talk to a friend about what they read. They\u2019ll ask a question.\n\nThere\u2019s this advice about social media that says that you shouldn\u2019t follow as many people as follow you. That you need, I suppose, to give the impression that you\u2019re popular.\n\nBut I always remember that when my older daughter was in middle school and Twitter was a bright new thing, her favorite author followed her. Meg Cabot (or probably her assistant) followed my kid and she was over the moon.\n\nAnd you know what? She still loves Meg Cabot. And you know what else? I still love Meg Cabot. She made my daughter a reader on a whole other level. That one little follow garnered her two deeper connections with readers than she would have otherwise had.\n\nThat was long before I had any published books, but I realized then that I wanted to make people feel the way Meg Cabot made my daughter feel that day.\n\nSo, what does it all mean?\n\nI think it means, for writers, that you can read all the advice and strategy guides and tip listicles there are \u2014 and none if it will really matter if you\u2019re not making a connection.\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily need to make a personal, one-on-one connection with every reader. I mean, you\u2019re only one person. But you can remember that your readers are people who have chosen to spend their free time with you.\n\nYou can throw away the adages about how many people you should follow.\n\nYou can pay attention to your readers, so that your work becomes a conversation with them, instead of you pontificating and getting upset when no one listens.\n\nWhen I think about sticky novelists, I think about Meg Cabot following my kid on Twitter. And Chuck Palahniuk teaching me about thought verbs. And Stephen King\u2019s letters to his Constant Readers. I think about Ellen Hopkins traveling all year long to schools to meet her young readers.\n\nI also think about Ray Bradbury and Octavia Butler and Judy Blume and a hundred other authors who told stories that invited me in. And that\u2019s harder to do, of course. Way harder than following someone on Twitter. But it\u2019s what I meant about being in conversation with your reader.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first impression that mattered to me the most for any of those writers. I don\u2019t remember which Judy Blume book I read first. Freckle Juice, maybe. But I will never forget reading Tiger Eyes when it was brand new in 1981. It was the first time I ever read anything that made me think \u2014 oh, my god, this author knows me. I was ten years old.\n\nI\u2019ve bought all of Blume\u2019s books for my children. I\u2019ve shared them with young friends my entire adult life. My daughters and I stood in line for hours to meet her at a book event and it was worth every minute. She made a sticky impression on me in the sixth grade.",

Make sure your story backs up the claim in the headline.\n\nSteer clear of clickbait headlines \u2014 tropes like \u201cone weird thing\u201d or using \u201cthis/that\u201d to get the reader to click. Make sure your story backs up the claim in the headline. Bigger is not better. Make sure the caps lock is off. No all-caps titles.\n\nHere are a few great headline examples:\n\nHow To Become Ridiculously Self-Aware In 20 Minutes\n\nHow to Figure Out What the Hell You Want to Do With Your Life\n\n9 Business Lessons I Learned Making $100,000 Online in the Past 3 Years\n\nMy Powerful 1-Hour Routine for Quick Success on Medium\n\nElon Musk Wants You To Merge With Your Technology\n\nHere are a few not-so-great headlines:\n\nOn Headlines\n\nMom\n\nTo Be a Perfect Person, Do This One Simple Thing\n\nSubtitle\n\nWriting directly below the title is considered the subtitle.

Be sure to update in both places. This article helps clarify Medium\u2019s SEO options and settings.\n\nCover images\n\nIn The Innovation, all stories have a cover image that follows the title and subtitle.\n\nAlways include a high-resolution image at the top of a story under your headline. This has the following benefits:\n\nWhen people share your story on social media, it will be more prominent in news feeds, making people more likely to click on it. It will look better in Medium\u2019s own news feeds. Humans are visual creatures and click on images.\n\nAll images should be as wide as the text body of your article and ideally offer bigger sizes when you click on them in the editor \u2014 However, If you have a chart that is hard to read when it\u2019s small, go bigger\n\nDon\u2019t use the widescreen or expanded formatting for images \u2014 keep them all in body-width, as shown in the example:\n\nImage by Author\n\nTechnically as a writer, you are liable for copyright infringement, and Medium is not. The simplest way to attribute an image is to put the words \u201cImage credit\u201d below an image and link this text to its original source.\n\nWhen you use an image, make sure you have the right to use it. If you are using an image you don\u2019t have the rights to, that\u2019s a copyright violation and disqualifies your story from curation.\n\nAll images in your article must show proper attribution to their respective source. Here is an example:\n\nPhoto by Jonas Jacobsson on Unsplash\n\nPlease credit all images properly as \u201cPhoto by,\u201d \u201cImage via\u201d or otherwise doesn\u2019t matter as much as naming the actual source of the image and linking to it.\n\nWhenever you\u2019re using your own pictures, simply add \u201cImage by Author, Picture by Author, Image Courtesy of the Author, or Screenshot by Author\u201d as the caption.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for images you can safely use without permission, check out Pexels, Unsplash, or search Google for images labeled for Creative Commons licenses.\n\nPlease make sure you actually have permission to use the image\n\nhave permission to use the image Stick with a simple, relevant image that relates to the main message or core theme of your post.\n\nSection headings\n\nWhen possible, submissions should be split into well-organized sections using correctly formatted section headings.\n\nIn every post, you should only have one \u201cHeading 1,\u2033 your post title. Use \u201cHeading 2\u201d for the main subheadings that support the title of your post. If you use \u201cHeading 3,\u201d those subheadings should support the \u201cHeading 2\u201d topics they\u2019re under.\n\nHere\u2019s an outline for properly formatted headings:\n\nImage by Author\n\nCreating lists\n\nBullet Points \u2014 To begin a bulleted list, go to a new line, type in a dash (-) or asterisk (*), and press Space. Next, you start typing your first item. Once you hit Enter on your keyboard, the list will be reformatted for you automatically.\n\nNumbered List \u2014 To begin a numbered list, go to a new line, type in 1. (numeral one, period), and press the space bar on your keyboard. The list will automatically add subsequent numbers when you hit Enter on the keyboard.\n\nMentioning Medium users\n\nType \u201c@\u201d and then the name of the person you want to mention. Mentioning someone will link to their profile and send them a notification when you publish.\n\nImage alt text\n\nThis text helps screen-reading tools describe images to visually impaired readers and allows search engines to better crawl and rank your website.\n\nWhether or not you perform SEO for your Medium articles, optimizing your article\u2019s image alt text is your ticket to creating a better user experience for your visitors, no matter how they first found you.\n\nHow to Add Alt Text to Your Medium Article Images:\n\nFor an existing article, click the \u201cedit story\u201d tab in the upper right-hand corner.

        "title": "What Cycling Across Canada Taught Me About Starting a Writing Business",
        "text": "I biked across Canada in the summer of 2017.\n\nI had just finished my master\u2019s degree, which was a very challenging experience \u2014 and not really in a good way. As I was finishing my thesis, I decided I needed to do something to recover. I wanted to do something difficult, but I didn\u2019t want to think too hard. I didn\u2019t want to rely on other people for my success. I wanted to get out of my head and into my body.\n\nSo I bought a bike and started pedalling.\n\nBetween June and September, I cycled 7,400 kilometres (about 4,600 miles) from Victoria, British Columbia to St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland.\n\nThen, a few years ago, I started a freelance writing business. Riding 7,400 kilometres across the country seems like a very different endeavour than creating a business, but a lot of the things I learned from my bike tour have actually helped me with both my writing and figuring out how to create a business from scratch.\n\nHere are a few of those things.\n\nYour Best Ideas Come When You\u2019re Moving\n\nPhotos by the author. Left: Thunder Bay, Ontario. Middle: A highway rest stop, Alberta. Right: The Cabot Trail, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe two months I spent on that bike were the most creative two months I\u2019ve ever had. It was a free flow, idea after idea, for five hours a day.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of research to support the idea that exercising helps us be more creative. But I didn\u2019t realize how powerful the effect of exercise really was. As soon as I was on the bike, I found myself solving problems, making connections, and generating ideas.\n\nI use this as a practice all the time now with my writing. When I\u2019m stuck with something, I go for a walk, go to the gym, or even do housework. (I actually had the idea for this article while I was washing dishes.) It\u2019s productive and it helps ignite creativity.\n\nKeep a Journal (Even When You\u2019re Tired)\n\nYour best ideas may come when you\u2019re exercising, but they will also disappear if you don\u2019t capture them.\n\nI learned about disappearing ideas the hard way. Everyone asked me if I was keeping a blog for my trip. I sort of did, but I was very haphazard about it. Now that I write blogs for a living, I\u2019m kicking myself for not taking it more seriously.\n\nI took notes occasionally, but not nearly as many as I should have. After cycling all day, setting up camp, making dinner, and washing my shorts, I just wanted to lie down. I felt too tired and told myself I would do it tomorrow. But then, I would be busy in the mornings making breakfast, packing up, and trying to get an early start. And then I biked all day. There never seemed to be time.\n\nI forgot most of those ideas that I had while I was biking. When I look back, I see that I wasted so much of the creative opportunity that I had simply by not taking notes.\n\nSo the lesson for me was to journal regularly. Now I keep a journal by my bed and a file in the notes app on my phone for random ideas. I also have a proper journal where I usually try to write an anecdote or two about my day. And I\u2019m disciplined about it \u2014 even when I\u2019m tired, I try to write at least one short story. The five minutes I spend jotting down my ideas will absolutely be worth it later.\n\nSome Tools are Essential \u2014and Some Aren\u2019t\n\nPhotos by the author. Left: Lake Louise, Alberta. Right: Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole culture around biking equipment. When I started, I had no idea what was important and what wasn\u2019t. People give different advice: Some say disc brakes are essential because they stop the fastest; others say you want V-breaks because they can be fixed anywhere. Some people say you need to have front panniers to balance the weight on your bike properly; others say they make your bike too heavy. Virtually everyone will tell you that you need cycling shorts.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so I opted for a minimalist version of all that. I used V-breaks because that\u2019s what the bike I bought off Craigslist had. I didn\u2019t buy front panniers; I just packed everything on the back and held it on with bungee cords. I wore regular basketball shorts.\n\nOver time, I learned what was essential and what wasn\u2019t. V-brakes are fine, as long as they work \u2014 but make sure they work. You don\u2019t need front panniers, you just have to be okay with less stuff. But it turns out those sleek cycling shorts aren\u2019t just for making your butt look great \u2014 they are actually designed to prevent saddle sores. (Ask me how I know.) They\u2019re essential.\n\nThe lesson I took from my experience with biking gear was to find a basic system that worked and then to focus on cycling. Tweak as needed.\n\nI\u2019ve applied this strategy to my writing business, as well.\n\nThere are lots of people selling courses or giving advice on how to cold call potential clients, how to write blog posts that rank on Google, whether you need a website, and which grammar app you should use.\n\nI still don\u2019t have a lot of money, so I applied the same strategy that I did with biking: Start with something basic, focus on writing, and then adapt. I\u2019ve been fine without expensive online courses, but a couple of SEO courses on Coursera were really useful. A website was essential. The free version of Grammarly is fine for me.\n\nFind a system that works for you and then focus on writing. Tweak as needed.\n\nTalk to Strangers\n\nThey\u2019re so helpful. Strangers gave me information about the best bike routes, the best places to camp, and how to avoid bears. They gave me food and water. They gave me places to sleep. At a beautiful beach in Marathon, Ontario, this lady from New York and her Aussie boyfriend made me a meal on a fire and then left me with a bag of Chaga mushrooms. At a Tim Hortons in New Brunswick, a stranger came up and gave me $50 (he felt sorry for me). This lovely couple on Prince Edward Island made me and this other guy a full lobster dinner. At a lighthouse on the Cabot Trail, Moe and Elaine from Massachusetts invited me to stay on the extra bed in their trailer.\n\nCycling taught me that most people, most of the time, are really great. They will help you.\n\nWriting is the same. It was only relatively recently that I decided to try to connect with other writers. I started with Reddit and I\u2019m still getting into Medium, but in both places I\u2019ve found other writers to be really useful. Writers have great advice. They share connections. They pass on leads. Joining a writing community has been highly beneficial for me.\n\nCycling is a solo sport, and yet it\u2019s way easier with support. Writing is the same: You do it alone, but it\u2019s somehow still way easier when you have a community around you.\n\nMost of It Is Grunt Work\n\nPhotos by the author. Left: Schreiber, Ontario. Middle: Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Right: Morley, Alberta.\n\nCycling a really long way seems like it would be hard. But it isn\u2019t really. To successfully cycle a really long way, you just have to consistently get on the bike and pedal. You do that over and over and over and, eventually, you\u2019ll find that you have gone a really long way.\n\nThe cycling part is easy. But it\u2019s an endurance sport \u2014 the hard part is doing it for a long time, over and over.\n\nWriting is a lot harder than cycling. You can do it badly. (You can\u2019t really do cycling badly.) So it\u2019s not quite the same.\n\nBut here\u2019s what they have in common: The trick to being successful is just doing it. You get on the computer, and you type for a long time, and when you do that enough, you find that you have written something. It\u2019s not glamorous or magical; it\u2019s grunt work.\n\nWriting, like cycling, is an endurance sport.\n\nYou Are What You Do\n\nThere\u2019s a strange kind of identity that comes with cycling. I never really thought of myself as an athlete, and certainly not as a cyclist. I\u2019d never done much cycling at all, except as a way to get to school or work. I knew nothing about bikes themselves, the equipment, or cycling culture. (The first time someone asked me what kind of bike I had, my answer was, \u201ca black one.\u201d)\n\nBut once you\u2019re on the bike, you\u2019re a cyclist.\n\nIt\u2019s the same for writing. If you are making money from writing \u2014 any money at all \u2014 you\u2019re a writer. It helps to remember that when you\u2019re finding it difficult and you feel a bit like an imposter. Like somehow you\u2019re not a real writer.\n\nHave you written something? Did you make money from it? Then you are a writer. Don\u2019t worry about whether you\u2019re a real writer. You are. Just worry about the writing.\n\nSomeone Is Always Better Than You\n\nPhotos by the author. Left: Emerald Lake, Alberta. Right: The Confederation Bridge, New Brunswick.\n\nEveryone who saw the bundle of gear attached to my bike asked me where I was going. And it seemed like each of them knew someone who had biked across Canada better than me.\n\nOne person knew someone who did it in 50 days, which was 30 days faster than me. Someone prepared for a whole year before they did it. One couple didn\u2019t prepare at all; they just bought a bike spur-of-the-moment while they were on vacation and started without a backwards glance. Another person knew someone who rode 400 kilometres in one day, in a storm with the wind at their back. Someone spent almost nothing on the trip. Someone else had no gear; he just carried a credit card and stayed in hotels. Some people I met were doing this for their second or third or 12th time. Virtually everyone knew more about bikes, the geography, the route, or the weather than me. There was always someone doing it better.\n\nBut in the end, I still got there just like they did.\n\nWriting is the same. It seems like everyone is publishing articles about how they made six figures in their first year, or how to write a $500 article in 40 minutes. (Speaking of which, congratulations on $11,000 in 30 days, Tim!)\n\nThere are lots of writers (the majority of them, probably) who are funnier, smarter, and more interesting than me. Lots of people have written more. Lots of people publish in fancy places. They\u2019re doing it better.\n\nBut I am writing for a living. I am certainly not making six figures, but I\u2019m sustainable and paying off my student loans. I\u2019m getting there.\n\nThe lesson is not to worry about whether you\u2019re the best. You\u2019re not. But you\u2019re good enough. Keep pedalling.\n\nYou Make Your Own Journey\n\nI met lots of people on the same journey as me. There was the new doctor on his sprint bike eating nothing but power bars. There was Mike, an ex tech CEO with his sturdy bike packed with 200 pounds of gear, slowly trudging away using peanut M&Ms for fuel. There was the vegetarian cyclist couple who were 17 years old and doing 250 kilometres a day, but who had one of their dads following behind them, carrying their camping gear in his truck. There was the 88-year-old woman doing it for the 12th time. There was Grace, the pole dancer, who mostly rode but sometimes hitchhiked (\u201cWhatever. It\u2019s my trip.\u201d) and who determined her route in part based on Tragically Hip songs.\n\nEach of these people had their own style and were on their own journey. Each one succeeded.\n\nThis can also be applied to writing. I\u2019ve known people who were on many different journeys: Some became content writers after a career in journalism; others started writing after they quit their sales career. I have a friend who was a musician before specializing in product descriptions. My background was in academia and government where I wrote about research and its implications for policy.\n\nPeople can help and give you advice, but each person\u2019s writing journey is different. It\u2019s a bit scary, but it\u2019s empowering, too. Do your own thing.\n\nJust Get Started\n\nPhotos by the author. Left: Osoyoos, British Columbia. Middle: St. Johns, Newfoundland. Right: Slocan Lake, British Columbia.\n\nOne of the most common questions I got leading up to the trip was what I was doing to prepare for it. I told people I was riding a lot, but actually I wasn\u2019t. I rode the stationary bike at the gym for 20 minutes. I did that three times, total. That\u2019s it.\n\nThe truth is that I didn\u2019t really prepare at all. I had read a blog post (thank you affiliate marketing!) that said that the best way to prepare to cycle long distances was simply to cycle long distances. You could train as you go. Just don\u2019t go too hard too fast and you\u2019d be fine.\n\nThat was my strategy. The first couple of weeks were difficult, but I got through them. And then it was easier. To be fair, the first couple of weeks also had three mountain ranges, one of which was the Rockies\u2026 So.\n\nThe point is that the most important thing was to just start.\n\nI\u2019ve found that a writing business is the same. You can learn it as you go. Sure, it helps if you have some experience writing professionally and some knowledge of grammar rules. There are probably things you can do to prepare for starting a business \u2014 getting a legit website set up, doing some research, picking a niche, building a network. Maybe taking one of the many expensive courses that are out there.\n\nBut really, the idea that you need to be \u201cqualified\u201d to be a writer is a myth. You can learn to write as you\u2019re writing. You just need to get started.\n\nThere\u2019s No \u201cRight\u201d Way to Success\n\nAt first glance, cycling across Canada doesn\u2019t appear to have a lot in common with starting a business. But here\u2019s what they share: They are both big undertakings that can feel impossible at the start. And there are different ways to actually do them.\n\nLots of expert writers will give you specific tools, tips, and tricks that can help you write professionally or start a business. That can be helpful. But what I learned from my trip, and what I\u2019ve applied to my writing business, is that there are lots of \u201cright\u201d ways to be successful. Use other people\u2019s advice, sure, but don\u2019t get overwhelmed trying to be a writer the right way. You can do it your way.\n\nYou\u2019ve got what it takes. Take the guidance that\u2019s useful to you, leave what isn\u2019t. Try things out, experiment. And then work really hard at writing.\n\nAfter a while, you\u2019ll get there.",

        "title": "Optimizing Kafka for the cloud",
        "text": "By Ambud Sharma | Software Engineer, Logging team\n\nTakeaways\n\nDeveloping locality aware systems and balancing algorithms can help substantially reduce cost\n\nMaking Kafka Producer and Consumer rack aware helps efficiently route traffic\n\nData-driven engineering decision making is critical to continuously improve systems\n\nOne of the fundamental principles when operating in the cloud is to ensure applications safeguard against outages. A common way to achieve this is to spread an application\u2019s deployment across multiple failure domains. In a public cloud environment, Availability Zone (AZ) can serve as a failure domain. We can use multiple AZs to provide fault tolerance for an application.\n\nDistributed systems like HDFS are traditionally made rack aware to improve fault tolerance by spreading replicas across multiple racks within a datacenter. However, using AZs as rack information is a common practice when running in cloud environments. This enables spreading data copies across multiple AZs, thereby providing fault tolerance in case one fails. While replicating data across AZs provides fault tolerance, it does come at a premium in form of AZ transfer costs.\n\nAt Pinterest, we use Kafka extensively as a scalable, fault tolerant distributed message bus to power several key services like user action counting and change data capture (CDC). Since we have Kafka running at a very large scale, we need to be mindful of AZ transfer costs and run as efficiently as possible, and so we focused on reducing the amount of data transferred across AZ.\n\nWhen a Kafka cluster has brokers spread across multiple AZs, it results in three types of cross AZ network traffic:\n\nInter-broker replication traffic Traffic from Producers in different AZs Traffic from Consumers in different AZs\n\nOut of the above traffic types we need 1 for fault tolerance. However, 2 and 3 are unwanted side effects that cause additional cost which, in theory, can be eliminated.\n\nDesign\n\nThere are two potential ways to solve this problem.\n\nApproach 1\n\nWe can make our Producers and Consumers write/read data only for partitions whose leaders share the same AZ to make them more cost efficient.\n\nApproach 2\n\nAlternatively we could deploy AZ specific Kafka clusters, but in order to achieve this any other real-time consumers would need to make their business logic AZ aware.\n\nIn the interest of simplicity, we chose to go with Approach 1 since it minimized code and stack changes. Producer / Consumer AZ awareness can be achieved by looking up the rack information for the leader broker of the partition we are trying to read/write to, and change the partitioning logic for producers and assignments for consumer.\n\nIn Kafka, the broker\u2019s rack information is part of the PartitionInfo metadata object that is shared with Kafka clients (both consumers and producers). Therefore, we deployed rack awareness to our Kafka clusters, where each broker publishes the AZ it\u2019s in as node rack info.\n\nWe started this initiative with our biggest producer and consumer applications for Kafka, logging agent and S3 transporter.\n\nProducer AZ Awareness\n\nOur logging agent is responsible for reading data from log files and shipping them to Kafka in microbatches. The agent also lets users configure how logs are partitioned across a topic\u2019s partitions.\n\nOne key design of our logging agent is the ability to pre-partition the data before calling Kafka\u2019s producer.send(). This allows us to add more advanced routing. To make it AZ aware, we added ability for the logging agent to look up AZ info for the node it\u2019s running on using the EC2 Metadata API. Next, we enhanced our partitioner to leverage rack information in Kafka\u2019s producer metadata to limit writes to only partitions for which leaders are in the same AZ as the logging agent. (This change was only applicable to topics that didn\u2019t use key based partitioning since ordering couldn\u2019t be guaranteed after AZ awareness change, as a partition switches AZ.)\n\nConsumer AZ Awareness\n\nS3 transporter is responsible for reading logs from Kafka and persisting them to S3 for further processing. We tried something similar to the producer for S3 transporter.\n\nOur S3 transporter doesn\u2019t use Kafka consumer assignments. Rather, it uses its own partition assignment system. This allows us to preserve locality in case of node restarts or has temporary network isolation, thus reducing the amount of data that needs to be replayed for a given batch.\n\nWe make each S3 transporter worker look up and publish its AZ info to Zookeeper, which helps the S3 transporter master assign Kafka partitions to the workers based on their rack (AZ). If we are unable to look up the (rack) AZ information of a partition, we degrade to assignment across all available workers.\n\nResults\n\nWe rolled out AZ aware S3 transporter to production, which resulted in more than 25% savings in AZ transfer cost for Logging. We\u2019re currently in the process of slowly rolling out AZ aware logging agent to further reduce our AZ transfer costs.\n\nWe\u2019re also working to extend this design to standard Kafka Producers and Consumers to help us extend our savings to other applications as well, which may include KIP-392 once it\u2019s implemented.\n\nAcknowledgements: Huge thanks to Eric Lopez, Henry Cai, Heng Zhang, Ping-Min Lin, Vahid Hashemian, Yi Yin, Yinian Qi and Yu Yang who helped with improving Logging at Pinterest.

        "text": "You Know What to Do With Your Life, You\u2019re Just Not Doing It.\n\nJust be honest with yourself.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure you at least kind of sort of know what you want to do with your life. Maybe it isn\u2019t crystal clear to you, but the foundation is there.\n\nDNA is strange in that it just gives you your own unique set of characteristics. When you\u2019re a kid, you\u2019re just drawn to certain activities for no apparent reason. You develop tastes, inclinations, and desires.\n\nDuring your upbringing though, you also develop fears. You\u2019re taught fears. If left to your own devices, without learning about concepts like \u2018being realistic\u2019 or worrying about \u2018risk\u2019 you\u2019d probably be more or less living the type of life you want to live.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for going through the societal ringer and coming out the other side with a life you don\u2019t want. That\u2019s the default outcome.\n\nI make no guarantees you\u2019ll get out of it either. One of the hardest things to do in this life, in this society, is to be who you truly are and do what you truly want to do.\n\nThere are just so many incentives pointing in the opposite direction. If you want to stand a chance of making it out, you have to learn how to rediscover the real you and remember that you already know what you want.\n\nLooking back at my past, I\u2019ve always known I wanted to be a writer. I\u2019ve been obsessed with words from a young age. I always had a great vocabulary without trying to have one. I\u2019d write poems when I was in middle school.\n\nI\u2019d offhandedly mention wanting to write a book more times than I can count. I knew. Business always fascinated me. The idea of being free fascinated me. I was always curious about life and what it took to be successful. All the tools were there and I just had to pull the trigger.\n\nThe same goes for you.\n\nYou Already Know What You Want to Be, You\u2019re Just Putting it Off\n\nI remember this conversation I had with an Uber driver in Los Angeles on my way to the airport. She asked what I did for a living and I told her I was a self-improvement writer.\n\nOf course, she began to tell me her life story and started asking me for advice. She was driving Uber because she was trying to earn extra money to solve this dispute over a debt or property taxes, something like that. She was frazzled and went on and on about how she didn\u2019t know how to find a way out.\n\nWe talked about her past job experience, her potential dreams, options to get out of her bind. We kept going back and forth but never quite got to the root of the issue or a viable solution. She was hiding. This went on for an hour (L.A. has a lot of traffic).\n\nAs we reach the airport she mentions that she has this long track record of consulting experience and that she\u2019d been offered deals to work with companies in the past. She says \u201cYou know, maybe I should start a business doing that.\u201d In my mind, I thought \u201cYeah, lady, maybe you should.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a weird human quirk. We dodge the answers right in front of us. Why? Because it can\u2019t be that simple, right?\n\nIf it is that simple, then you feel like an idiot for not doing anything about it. So you make up these complicated excuses for why you\u2019re not doing the things you want because that explanation is easier to deal with than facing the truth upfront.\n\nI have so many stories like this. Often I ask questions on my personal social media \u201cWhat kind of business would you start if you were certain it would work out?\u201d I remember once a friend of mine described her potential business to a tee \u2014 had the name and everything. I hope she starts it one day.\n\nHope you start your thing one day. Hope you don\u2019t put it off forever \u2014 your bakery, your e-commerce business, your comedy career, your daycare, your jewelry shop in a tourist trap, whatever the heck it is, doesn\u2019t matter, as long as you think it\u2019s cool.\n\nHow do you overcome this fear that causes you to put things off? The process I use for all aspects of self-improvement is the same \u2014 diagnose the problem and try your best to come up with a solution.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the root causes of your inaction.",

        "text": "Dr. Chris Meinzen is a hospitalist at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in creative writing and neuroscience at Tulane University in New Orleans, followed by working at the Red Cross, and eventually by medical school also at Tulane.\n\nHow did you decide to go to medical school?\n\nI was a little bumbling at that age. I liked school, enjoyed learning, and had some good friends going in that direction. My family encouraged me to try it out, and here I am 10 years later.\n\nDid you consider other healthcare or public health tracks?\n\nI didn\u2019t, but mostly due to lack of exposure. I think the larger impact of public health is really interesting. I\u2019m not sure I had ever really considered other healthcare tracks, though there are a lot to look at for sure. The physical and occupational therapists always seem the happiest in the hospitals. Maybe I should\u2019ve thought more about that.\n\nWhat was your medical school application experience like?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember now. I remember a lot of checking and rechecking some kind of clunky electronic system. I hope that\u2019s gotten easier to use.\n\nWhat was your medical school experience like?\n\nI loved my classmates at Tulane, we had a wonderful time. I think our professors did a great job teaching us and leading us to think both scientifically about our patients as well as see them as people with their own lives, social group, and preferences. It was a great time to work hard, learn a lot, and enjoy New Orleans.\n\nWhat was your residency application experience like?\n\nI researched pulmonary diseases in Peru with a group out of Johns Hopkins for a year before going to residency. That was fun, and a great cultural experience, but it did make applying to residencies back in the States a little more difficult. There\u2019s a lot of flights, and skin-deep conversation. Ultimately I\u2019m thankful for it because it brought me to our home here in Grand Junction.\n\nWhat was your residency experience like?\n\nResidency is also great, though maybe not so cheery as medical school. You have to work hard, but you can\u2019t control your schedule. Less sleep, more work, more practical knowledge, more people wanting your time. It was probably good preparation for life after residency, but it was pretty exhausting while it happened. I happen to think that St. Mary\u2019s Family Medicine Residency was exceptional at preparing me for my varied clinical roles now, and can\u2019t be more thankful. I just don\u2019t think I could do that again from a stamina perspective.\n\nWhat advice would you give to people interested in becoming a doctor?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to really know what that will be like for you. It\u2019s worth shadowing a doc, and getting to know a day in the life of a med student and resident is like. It\u2019s a good 6\u201310 years on the path. Ha, I guess I\u2019m saying other people should give the decision a little more consideration prior to jumping right in like I did.\n\nHow did you decide what to specialize in?\n\nI actually applied for residencies in 4 different fields, because I had a hard time limiting myself. There\u2019s a variety of ways to become a hospitalist, ER doc, residency preceptor. Family medicine at my program was one great path, there are likely other good ones too. I was lucky to have great rotations in medical school to learn how much I like thinking deeply about both pathology (what\u2019s going wrong with a body) as well as how people want to live. Fortunately, I have continued to enjoy that.\n\nWhat does continuing education look like for a doctor?\n\nWell, we have some minimum number of credits or hours to remain licensed. I don\u2019t really know the number, but I probably do 2\u20136 hours a week, which I think is quite a bit above the requirement. At least I hope it is.\n\nThere are powerpoints and books and lectures and hands-on courses and ultrasound things. It\u2019s pretty cool what all you can learn with.\n\nWhat is your current role like?\n\nI have two contract positions. I am a hospitalist at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, which is the regional medical center in Grand Junction. Hospitalists are the people who daily care for sick people stuck in the hospital. The other is working shifts as an ER doc in a critical access hospital in Fruita, Colorado, called Colorado Canyons. ER shifts are pretty much what you\u2019ve seen on TV.\n\nThe last thing I do, mostly because I enjoy it, is precepting our local residents a few times a month. This is a whole different view of medicine, focusing on developing these residents while ensuring great patient care. The variety for me is really fulfilling.\n\nWhat changes do you see happening in the near future in U.S. healthcare?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question. Probably more suited to Congress than to me. We have the most expensive healthcare system in the world, and not the most effective one. I think the mix of requirement for insurance by legislature, employers controlling many healthcare plans, along with the requirement that hospitals take all-comers, makes for a lot of expense. On the back end, it can be hard for a lot of people to access appropriate healthcare, or even know what they\u2019re getting when they do get in. I\u2019m not a politician or really all that astute about healthcare policy. It does seem like it\u2019s too expensive and hard to navigate for a lot of Americans, so I imagine that\u2019s the ripe avenue for change.\n\nWhat advice would you give to recent medical school graduates?\n\nWell, if you\u2019re graduating medical school then I hope you found a residency spot. I guess you\u2019d be a few months in, ideally still in your high enthusiasm stage. That\u2019s good. Don\u2019t judge yourself when you get tired or worn out. Notice what helps you recharge, and cultivate those opportunities. Give grace to yourself, your colleagues, and your patients. We\u2019re all human. It means we all fall down, and sometimes it means we get to help the person beside us back up.",

        "title": "How to Silence the Haters in Your Head as You Write",
        "text": "But then self-doubt crept in. I started thinking of all the potential readers who would disagree with my post and rage on me in the comments.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t have a degree in psychology. What if people jumped into the comments and told me I\u2019m not qualified to write about the topic? I had seen it happen with other people\u2019s articles on narcissism, even though I had gained considerable insight and value from what the authors wrote.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s a school of thought that says, we should love the narcissists for their flaws, and not speak badly of them. Well, we should also love the victims. Those of us who have experience can save potential victims years of confusion and frustration. Still, though, it was an argument I didn\u2019t care to have in the comments section of a post.\n\nThird, I worried narcissists themselves would get on the comments and rage at me, bash me, even threaten me. By exposing who they are and how they act, I represent a threat to their way of life.\n\nFourth and finally, I come from the southern U.S. where every discussion seems to turn into a matter of race. Would someone claim I am using a racist term by writing about \u201cWhite Knight\u201d narcissism (as compared to the classic \u201cDark Knight\u201d type of narcissist)? I was just using the term coined by the expert, and I certainly never intended it to be racist, but I felt I had to be worried someone would interpret it that way.\n\nHow to overcome your self-doubt as a writer\n\nBelow are three strategies I used to overcome my fear of criticism. I went on to publish my article on White Knight narcissism, which has become one of my three most successful articles this month.\n\nYour haters don\u2019t know you; to them, you\u2019re just a symbol\n\nHaters, for the most part, are people who are going through life with an ax to grind. They\u2019re going to spew their venom on someone. In this case, it just happened to be your post that supplied the necessary trigger they were seeking. If it hadn\u2019t been you, they would have raged on someone else who unknowingly fueled their fire.\n\nLook. If someone\u2019s exposure to who you are is limited to a 5-minute article they read on a website, they don\u2019t know you. Rather, you symbolize whatever perceived injustice gets them up on their soapbox.\n\nWhen someone has a vast overreaction to what you have to say, they\u2019re not telling you something about yourself \u2014 they\u2019re telling you something about themselves. Specifically, they\u2019re telling you that they don\u2019t deserve even another second of your time, so close their comment without responding, take a moment to cleanse your energy if you feel the need, and move on.\n\nIf everybody likes you, you are doing it wrong. \u2014 Ben Michaels\n\nWhat would your writing coach tell you?\n\nWhat\u2019s that? You don\u2019t have a writing coach? Yeah, me neither. At least not one I can see.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned to do, and what I would advise you to try as well when you encounter resistance when writing, is to imagine your best future writing self 6 to 12 months from now. Imagine the writer who has many published stories and successes under their belt. What would that version of you tell you to do?\n\nDo you really think that future self would tell you, \u201cNaaah, don\u2019t write that, there might be one person out there somewhere who would disagree with what you have to say. You wouldn\u2019t want to offend them.\u201d Of course not! So step into that best future self.\n\nCredit where credit is due: I got the idea to check in with my future writing self from If You Ask Yourself This Question Every Single Day, You\u2019ll Be Ahead of 99% by Sinem Gunel. It\u2019s most definitely worth 4 minutes of your time if you need help getting unstuck.\n\nWrite for your biggest fans\n\nImagine that you have people out there who visit your profile page every day. They\u2019ve come to see if you\u2019ve posted anything new today, because they\u2019re eager to read anything that you, one of their favorite writers, has to say.\n\nWhat? You don\u2019t have readers like that? Can you prove it?\n\nSeveral times on this and other platforms, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover I did have those kinds of fans, and didn\u2019t know it.\n\nSo why not write for them?\n\nI\u2019ll let you in on a little secret: If you write for those fans, even if you don\u2019t currently have them, you soon will. Your enthusiasm will be contagious and people will want to read more from you. Doesn\u2019t that sound like a better strategy than writing for trolls and haters?\n\nPhoto by David Peterson from Pexels\n\nIn summary\n\nWriters, like any other kind of human, are subject to bouts of self-doubt and fear of criticism. Not only is it hard to get unwarranted criticism out of your head, but it\u2019s also easy to imagine future unwarranted criticism that can make you question whether you should publish some of your best work. Uncertainty presents the ego-driven mind an opportunity to fill in the blanks with things that could go wrong.\n\nThere are strategies, however, to silence the mind. If you worry about unwarranted criticism, realize the critics see you as a symbol and that they are commenting on themselves far more than they are you.\n\nLearn to reach out to your best future self as a writer, to connect with that best version of yourself, and to draw on their wisdom for guidance.\n\nFinally, imagine that you\u2019re writing for your most dedicated fans, even if you think you don\u2019t have any \u2014 you may be wrong, and if you don\u2019t currently have such fans, you will soon if you keep expressing your best self.\n\nThanks for reading!

        "title": "The Four Types of Writing",
        "text": "The Four Types of Writing\n\nEach one serves its own purpose\n\nPhoto by Debby Hudson on Unsplash\n\nThere are four types of writing as an author. Expository, persuasive, narrative, and descriptive. Each piece of writing includes one or all of these.\n\nExpository\n\nWriting from an author to inform or teach the reader something. You will find this type of writing in articles like this one you are reading. The language and style are meant to explain something to the reader. For this article I am explaining the four types of writing.\n\nTextbooks and how to articles will utilize expository in their wording. Even the recipes you use are a type of expository writing as the recipe tells you how to complete it. Newspapers are another example of this type of writing as the writer wants to inform the reader of the daily events taking place in their world.\n\nPersuasive\n\nWriting from an author to voice their opinion to persuade the reader. Persuasive pieces are most commonly found in speeches, scientific studies, medical journals and even political campaigns.\n\nThe term persuade means to convince someone else to agree with the argument set forth in the piece. Scientific studies and medical journals good concrete examples but this type of writing can be seen in advertisements, book reviews, editorials and brochures.\n\nNarrative\n\nWhere an author tells a story, fact or fiction, to the reader. This type of writing is also called storytelling as it has a main character, there is a conflict the main character is workingout and an ending that resolves the conflict. With everything in the middle called the plot.\n\nFiction is considered narrative as it tells the story of the main character as they work through their conflict trying to find the resolution. Non fiction can be considered narrative as well because, even though the story is not made up, there is still a main character, conflict and plot.\n\nDescriptive\n\nA type of expository which uses visual descriptions to tell the reader a story. Usually includes scenery, emotions and actions in a way that will resonate with the reader, allowing them to visualize the story in their mind as they are reading. It\u2019s primary purpose is to describe a person, place or thing.\n\nThis type of writing can be used in the other types of writings, as it pertains to painting a virtual picture for the reader. It is used in both fiction and non fiction. A good, clear attention is required to write in a way that interacts the five senses, sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nStorytelling, whether expository, persuasive, narrative or descriptive, is the formation of words written in a way to elicite excitement from the reader. All of these can be combined or used separately to convey a message.",

        "title": "5 Simple yet Effective Tips for Creating High-Quality Content for Your Content Marketing Strategy",
        "text": "#4. Content happens frequently and consistently.\n\nOne of the toughest aspects of an effective content marketing strategy has nothing to do with the substance of what\u2019s being communicated. It has to do with how much and how often you publish content.\n\nThe goal is to master the art of volume and consistency. It\u2019s tough to do both, especially just starting out, so I find it best to start with the consistency aspect to start building the habit.\n\nIf you\u2019re starting from ground zero on your content strategy, pick one or two avenues you want to focus on first. Let\u2019s say you decide on company blog posts and thought leadership articles from your CEO. Pick an achievable goal based on your team capacity\u2014maybe two 500-word blog posts, and one thought leadership article per week. Stick to that volume for six to eight weeks before implementing any other content marketing strategies.\n\nOnce you master that, you can either increase or expand your strategy. To increase is to continue what you\u2019re doing but in greater volume. If your company blog posts and thought leadership articles are performing well, try adding two more blog posts per week and one more thought leadership article per week, or whatever\u2019s manageable on a consistent basis.\n\nExpanding is jumping into other types of content like podcasts or video interviews, leveraging other types of material to maximize output. For example, can you think of all the material you can create from one hour-long filmed podcast episode?\n\nThe video of the podcast can be uploaded to YouTube, and segmented into tons of small video clips for Instagram and TikTok. The audio can be used to promote as a podcast on Apple or Anchor.FM. The transcripts of the audio can be turned into multiple thought leadership articles or company blog posts, as well as short-form status updates for LinkedIn.\n\nOf course, not all companies need to market on Instagram or YouTube, but expanding your strategy is always worth brainstorming internally to set yourself up with a plan to keep content ideas flowing.\n\nAt the end of the day, your preparedness is what\u2019s going to keep you publishing on a frequent and consistent basis.",

        "title": "Who Rules the Cloud Service: AWS or Azure?",
        "text": "Amazon Web Service (AWS)\n\nAWS is owned by Amazon and it is the number one cloud provider, according to the Public Cloud Share. That is the percentage of companies, the money involved in AWS is around 32% right now. So it is the maximum and that\u2019s why AWS is the leader in the cloud industry for the past 10 to 15 years.\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nAzure is owned by Microsoft, and it comes second only to AWS. They are second in the cloud race and they are again the same type of technology. So Azure is provided by Microsoft, but even then they are just a cloud provider like AWS.\n\nSimilarities between AWS and Azure\n\nSo both provide similar services, even though they provide similar services, they are two different entities owned by two different companies providing various services which are named differently. But their functionality is going to be the same. So I think you get the point that AWS and Azure are cloud providers owned by Amazon and Microsoft, respectively. AWS is the number one in cloud market share and Azure is number two and these two are the major cloud providers in the entire cloud computing industry.\n\nAWS vs Azure\n\n1. Launch Date\n\nAWS launched in the year 2006 and Azure launched in the year 2010. So basically in technology years, 4 years is a very long gap and that is one of the main reasons AWS has captured a lot of businesses and are in the lead in the cloud computing race\n\nAWS came into the cloud industry, but EC2 and S3 as the first projects of their first tools which were out for the public. And in 2010, Azure came up with basic services, like virtual machines, Azure storage, Azure database. So they came up with their own services.\n\n2. Regions\n\nAWS has 77 availability zones in 24 geographical regions across the globe. So these availability zones are the ones that have the physical servers, all the physical components which are required to launch service, database engines, or storage units. So AWS is the cloud provider that has the maximum number of availability zones in the world.\n\nWhy is availability zones really important?\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re from India, you\u2019re launching an application in India and it\u2019s very successful and your customer base is growing even out of the country. When that is happening, you want to expand your application to a global audience, and if you\u2019re using an on-premise set up with your own data center, a small data center. So in this case, you\u2019ll have to buy more servers to accommodate more users or you\u2019ll have to buy the servers in whichever location or whichever country in which you are going to extend your application. You\u2019ll have to buy a data center over there, or you\u2019ll have to buy a location, buy a space and set up a data center. But instead of doing that, if you\u2019re using AWS or if you\u2019re using Azure, in that case, you can use their global infrastructure and set up your application anywhere in the world just by sitting in your own office. So we can do that across the globe and you can engage your application with the global audience.\n\nNow, Azure has 60 different availability zones, but they are in 60 different regions, which is most by any cloud provider. So even though AWS was early in the cloud business, Microsoft was early in the tech business. Microsoft came into the tech business way before Amazon came into it.\n\nSo Amazon first launched as an e-commerce website, not a tech website or a website that provides cloud services. So Microsoft was already having a wide infrastructure across the world. So they were able to build their architecture accordingly. So their cloud infrastructure has grown across the globe in 60 different regions.\n\nWhy regions are important?\n\nLet me give you a brief example. Over here in India, there are three different availability zones in one particular region, which is in Mumbai. But if you look at India in Azure, you can see West India, Central India, and South India. So they have three different available results in three different regions, which can be helpful for low latency in applications. So let\u2019s say your application is mostly concentrated in South India, you can host it on the South Indian data center. If it is in Central India or if you want to concentrate on the whole of India, you can put in all the data centers. Or if you just want to concentrate on the north side of India or the west side of India, you can go ahead with the west or central India. The same goes for every single available zone or every single region available across.\n\nSo this is a difference. AWS has 77 Availability zones but in 24 geographical regions. Microsoft has 60 available zones lesser than AWS, but they have it in 60 different regions. That\u2019s the main difference. Also at the beginning of 2019, AWS had 54 availability zones and Azure had 44 availability zones. So both of them have grown pretty wildly.\n\nIn 2021, AWS is planning to build 18 more availability zones in six more regions, and Azure is planning to get 8 more available zones in 3 more azure regions. So they\u2019re still planning more regions.\n\n3. Market Share\n\nAs a common person, it doesn\u2019t matter. You can choose any of the cloud services which you want and you can start working on it and you can get a job in it.\n\nBut why do we talk about market share?\n\nSo let me tell you. First, whenever the market share for a particular business means a lot of businesses or a lot of companies are using that particular technology. So let\u2019s say AWS if their market share or their spending on that particular cloud provider is high. In that case, a lot of companies are investing in AWS. So if a lot of companies are investing in AWS, that means you have an abundance of jobs in various companies. So if you go with AWS or Azure or Google cloud, you have a lot of companies who are working with them. You can get into a job with them.\n\nAccording to Gartner Aws is the leading cloud service provider. So this means they are visionaries and they are leaders. So Microsoft, Google, Amazon services all come under leaders and visionaries. But the leading leaders are Amazon Web services and the leading visionary is Amazon Web Services.\n\n4. Niche players\n\nThis means the cloud services providers play on their particular role. So Alibaba Cloud or Oracle or IBM or Tencent Cloud, they have their cloud services which can accommodate their own company\u2019s infrastructure and the companies which are using similar services and that\u2019s why they are called niche players. They only play in that particular area. They don\u2019t move out of their expertise. But AWS, Microsoft, and Google are exploring the entire industry from healthcare, from retail to I.T. companies. So Every single place they have put down their staff.\n\n5. Clients\n\nNow, the top clients of Amazon Web Services are Netflix, Twitch, LinkedIn, and Facebook. So I think most probably, you know, these four different services at four different websites. So Netflix is the top media streaming platform in the world. Twitch is the top live streaming platform in the world. LinkedIn is the top job connectivity or job finding portal in the world. And Facebook is the largest social media network in the world. So four of these companies are using Amazon Web services for their cloud needs.\n\nFor Azure, the top spending companies or the top companies using are BMW, Twitter, Samsung, and eBay. Again, you would obviously know all of these companies. They are top companies who are using Azure for their cloud needs.\n\nSo if you are working well enough, you can get into these companies as a cloud architect or you can get into the previous companies, which I mentioned, Netflix, Facebook or LinkedIn or even eBay or Twitter. So you can get into these companies if you are a cloud architect or a cloud developer or an administrator or whatever it is, you can get into these companies and get a high salary.\n\n6. Services\n\nIn AWS, the relevant service is EC2 and in Azure, it is Azure Virtual Machine. So both of these services provide a secure, scalable, and reliable compute capacity (i.e) A server in the cloud. You can create a server as per your needs on the cloud.\n\n7. Storage\n\nIn Azure, you have to go to Azure blob storage. In AWS, you have to go to AWS S3 or AWS Simple Storage Service. So again, these two are similar services, S3 uses object storage to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Massively scalable and secure object storage for cloud-native workloads are archives and data lakes. So basically they are similar, just different explanations or different definitions for the same service, but they are provided by two different organizations.\n\n8. Database\n\nAWS has a Relational database service and Azure has SQL databases.\n\nWhat is the difference between a relational database and an SQL database?\n\nThey both use SQL and they are both database engines. In AWS, set up an operate and scalable relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks. In Azure, built apps that scale with the pace of your business with managed and intelligent SQL in the cloud.\n\nSo basically you can create a cloud engine on both. You can create a database on the cloud which is scalable, so you can set it up as scaled automatically, so it\u2019ll automatically scale up for you.\n\nSo in this case, they have similar services, the only major part is that AWS provides more services than Azure. AWS provides more than 150+ services right now, because, again, saying that they have a 4 years lead in the cloud computing industry, that\u2019s why they are leading by a lot. Even Azure provides a lot of services, they provide 100+ services, not as much as AWS. So you can go with any of them.\n\nIn the year 2021, both of them are growing at a really fast pace and other cloud services are trying to catch up with them, but they\u2019re not able to. AWS and Azure are still growing, so you can go ahead and take up AWS or Azure, there is no problem in taking up any of these cloud providers.\n\n9. Pricing Structure\n\nPricing models are one of the important factors before considering the cloud tool. In AWS, you have a pay-as-you-go model completely. It means whatever you use, you\u2019ll pay for that at the end of the month. So you\u2019ll start with zero credit. As you use services, it\u2019ll succumb up to a particular value or a particular amount of money which will be paying at the end of the month.\n\nEven Azure has pay-as-you-go, you can opt for that or there are also subscriptions where you can take up subscriptions that have certain limits within azure. So you can use that credit limit to go ahead and use the Azure service, which you want.\n\nFor 4 vCPLUS and 16-gigabyte memory, the On-Demand Linux instance in AWS will cost you 0.1856 dollars. But the same type of instance in Azure will cost you 0.1690 dollars. So now, just considering these two values, they\u2019re are quite small and there is not much difference, it\u2019s just like 0.15 Or something like that.\n\nBut if you\u2019re server is running for 24*7 and there are 100s of servers with the same specifications that will save you a lot of money if you\u2019re using Azure in this case.\n\nBut again, there is one more difference. That is in AWS, you\u2019ll get more discounts if you\u2019re taking up a one-year reserved or a three-year reserved instance and that means you will get a dedicated instance, dedicated server, where you can run instances at any time, and that can save you 42% of the money and in Azure, it can save you around 36% of the money. So AWS could be cheaper for the long run Azure will be cheaper if you\u2019re going to use On-Demand instances.\n\nOne more part is that in AWS, you\u2019ll be charged by the hour, (i.e) even though you have used a particular service for just one-minute even in that case, you\u2019ll be charged by the hour. So you\u2019ll have to pay the hourly rate. But in Azure, you\u2019ll only be charged the minute rate. So if you\u2019re using only for two minutes, you only pay for the two minutes you have used. You will not pay for the complete half.\n\nFuture Predictions for the Public Cloud Infrastructure\n\nAccording to Gartner, the cloud infrastructure will improve by 35% in the year 2021. That means the companies are moving towards the cloud-first approach than an on-premise data centre. It\u2019s increasing every single year, so there is no surprise element here. I just wanted to show what would be the future of the cloud industry. So again, when the cloud industry is growing, I would suggest you to get into it, so that you can grow with the cloud industry.\n\nSo you can visit these two sites, (aws.amazon.com and azure.microsoft.com) this is basically for India. You can check out the news updates which are coming out for AWS and Azure. They are basically in the latest article at first, so whichever change has been made recently, that will be at the top and you will get to know more about the changes or the changes of services in AWS and Azure.\n\nGain Access to Expert View \u2014 Subscribe to DDI Intel",

        "text": "Why Word Placement Is Important in Headlines\n\nReaders are attracted to the first 3 words and the last 3 words\n\nIllustration by Cynthia Marinakos.\n\nWhat you do when you\u2019re confronted with emails and social posts each day?\n\nHow do you browse through news websites and Medium articles?\n\nDo you click on each one?\n\nMost likely, you skim through the headlines to get the gist of it without having to click each one. Only clicking on the ones that call out to you at that moment, if you\u2019ve got time.\n\nA Kissmetrics study discovered that users pick out the first three words and the last three words of a headline. Headline expert Bnonn recommends keeping a headline to six words so that readers can quickly understand it.\n\nCopyblogger informs us that on average only two out of ten readers will read your article \u2014 eight out of ten will only read your headline copy.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s worth paying attention to word selection and word placement.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean we need to stick to only six words, although I came across several sites with headlines that consistently hovered around six words.\n\nFor longer headlines, it helps to consider the first three words and the last three words.\n\n\u201cAs a rule, if it won\u2019t fit in a tweet it\u2019s too long. But let me suggest that rather than worrying about length you should worry about making every word count. Especially the first and last three.\u201d \u2014 Kissmetrics\n\nThis discovery fits into the concept of frontloading for headlines. This is where you place the most important words first, and we can complement that with also carefully selecting the last three words. It will also help your headline\u2019s SEO by making sure your reader can find the keywords they\u2019re searching for.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with examples of headlines with six words and six and more words where the first three words and the last three words have been carefully chosen. You\u2019ll find helpful resources to help you with word selection. And finally, you\u2019ll discover a simple way to assess your headlines.",

If you want a lot of people to read your writing, you have to write the type of articles people actually want to read.\n\nIf you want to stop banging your head against the wall, feeling frustrated that your work is getting nowhere, focus on that simple truth.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to write a certain way. You\u2019re free to do what you wish. But, you also have to live with the results. I see far too many writers who blame their lack of success on the audience.\n\nJosh Spector once said, \u201cYou can write for an audience or write for yourself, but you can\u2019t do both.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t want commercial success that\u2019s fine. But too many writers want commercial success doing it their way when their way doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe choice is yours. But always remember the golden rule of writing. It\u2019s never the audience\u2019s fault.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to write how-to articles and listicles to get ahead. You really don\u2019t. But, your articles will perform better if you have the right answers to some of these key questions.",

        "text": "Despite the terrible SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently ravaging much of the world, we must try not to forget how far we have come as people of Earth in recent years. We also need to maintain an optimistic outlook as much as possible even in the face of truly challenging \u201cblack swan\u201d events.\n\nThis past year has been a big one in terms of technological landmarks:\n\n\u2014 IBM\u2019s Q System One became the first commercially available quantum computer.\n\n\u2014 A new synthetic DNA was created which doubles our current 4-letter code (A,T,C,G) to 8, allowing for greater possibilities in DNA computing. In another study, scientists injected a synthetic DNA into some E. coli bacteria. They survived, reproduced, and actually carried along copies of the synthetic DNA as well, offering proof that actual synthetic life can be created in a lab.\n\n\u2014 Researchers put nanoparticles that react to infrared light into the eyes of mice, giving them biological infrared vision.\n\n\u2014 In a massive project called the Event Horizon Telescope, astronomers linked powerful telescopes from all around the world to create a virtual mega-telescope with an aperture the size of Earth, and were able to image the black hole at the center of the Messier galaxy 55 million light years away.\n\n\u2014 3D printing of human tissue and organs can now be done without using the traditional scaffold model which acts as a support structure, allowing for more possibilities to save lives.\n\nAnd these are only a few large new steps into a world that used to exist only in our imaginations.\n\nWhat might happen in the 2020's?\n\nFuturists and other prognosticators have been hard at work coming up with lists, so here is a short one of my own:\n\n\u2014 AI creations will become nearly indistinguishable from the humans or animals they are meant to imitate.\n\n\u2014 Cloning of humans and animals (extinct or recently deceased) will continue to be debated by worldwide authorities, while rogue scientists continue to actually do it. Expect to see a lot of reborn labradoodles and a real, live baby mammoth, or something similar, by 2030.\n\n\u2014 While green power will keep getting more efficient and cheaper, the continued growth in developing nations will stall progress in declining greenhouse emissions.\n\n\u2014 3D printing, of everything from organs to electronics and housing, will become a cornerstone of modern manufacturing.\n\n\u2014 Robots and drones will grow into a truly transformative cultural phenomenon, launching new types of entertainment and becoming commonplace in daily life.\n\n\u2014 Quantum computing will lead to a doubling of all human knowledge between 2020 and 2030.\n\n\u2014 Humans will walk on the Moon, or Mars, or both.\n\n\u2014 Real, effective life extension therapies will become available, but only for the very wealthy. The rest of us will have to wait a while.\n\n\u2014 The Internet of Things will grow into what everyone\u2019s been envisioning for it: Complete inter-connectivity that enables greater productivity. However, the dangers of hacking will continue to loom over it.\n\nNow, let me return to the now.\n\nLooking back a little farther \u2014 but still fairly recent \u2014 SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, the largest ever, from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in February 2018.\n\nIts cargo was a Tesla Roadster, which is now orbiting the sun somewhere between Mars and the asteroid belt.\n\nBetween Elon Musk\u2019s numerous companies and passion projects (SpaceX, Tesla, Solar City, the Hyperloop, the Boring Company), and the quickly proceeding advances in VR/AR/MR, genetics/cloning, blockchain, AI, 3D printing, and other fields, someone who was in a coma since 1998 and just woke up yesterday would be forgiven for thinking they had jumped a hundred years into the future instead of a mere 20.\n\nBut then this person would actually get up and go out into the real world and see that mostly everything else is the same, aside from more traffic on the roads, more people in general, most of whom now carry miniature computers with them wherever they go that are more powerful than any desktop from the 20th century.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Grand Plan\n\nBorn in apartheid-era South Africa, he lived the first 16 years of his life in various towns, including Pretoria, moving back and forth between divorced parents. He reports being bullied in school and witnessing a lot of violence. He tried sticking up for some other bullied children, but that generally resulted in more pain for him. Musk retreated somewhat into science fiction and fantasy, and the dreams he read on the page would come to inform the man he eventually became.\n\nHe moved first to Canada to live with some relatives, and later earned economics and physics degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to co-found Zip2 with one of his brothers, Kimbal Musk, and Greg Kouri, which was acquired for $340 million. Next, he co-founded X.com, which became Paypal and sold to EBay in 2002 for one and half billion dollars.\n\nNow very rich, Elon Musk turned his attention to those science fiction dreams.\n\nIn the short term: The environment has been poisoned at an ever-growing pace by the burning of fossil fuels for two centuries, beginning with coal and reaching a pollution peak as the massive population of China began using gasoline-guzzling automobile en masse. Musk\u2019s contribution to helping slow this is multi-sided: popularize electric cars by offering visually appealing, efficient and powerful versions of them with Tesla. Invest in more solar power adoption via Solar City. Open-source a plan for super-fast commuter train transport with the electromagnetic vacuum-tube Hyperloop project. Invest in tunneling technology that can help move this project along with the Boring Company.\n\nIn the long term: There have been dozens of small extinction events on Earth since the dawn of life, and several that have wiped out 75\u201395% of all living things. It will happen again, and there is a good chance that a large event will take with it the vast majority of humanity. Because of this, Musk founded SpaceX with an ultimate goal of turning humanity into a multi-planet species. He\u2019s funding this by creating reusable rockets that allow him to outbid competitors in taking cargo into orbit. The plan is to start a colony on Mars that will eventually be made self-sustaining. Ultimately, he thinks this can become home to a million people by roughly 2070.\n\nIn other words, Elon Musk wants to save us here and now, and also do what he can to save us for eternity.\n\nAll in all, this is both an ambitious and worthy cause.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with doing what you can to save people. Doctors, soldiers, first responders, they do this all the time.\n\nAnd, in general, our governments don\u2019t seem to be doing much to slow our pollution of the environment or protect us from future disasters. Yes, there has been some progress, but it is often mired in politics and red tape, and forward-thinking policies of one administration are often reversed by the following one. Our governments can barely protect us from rising sea levels and flu virii, let alone giant asteroid impacts.\n\nSo, someone has to do it. These grand efforts usually form around the resources of extremely wealthy individuals and take many forms. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for instance, focuses on the physical and mental well being of the youngest and poorest people. Kimbal Musk, one of Elon\u2019s brothers, is using his fortune on a decidedly smaller scale in a quest to help reconnect us and our children in particular to a more natural, local and organic food culture.\n\nHope is both the strongest driving force and an impediment to progress.\n\nMany people who grew up in the early to mid 20th century thought we would be living in some kind of fairy-tale sci-fi wonderland by now. Others posited it would be a dystopia, or that all that would remain of our world would be a post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nWe\u2019re living in a time when dreams of generations past are becoming true on a regular basis. If a person born anywhere on Earth in 1899 were to be transported into the future, to right now, into a modern city, they would find a lot to recognize but they would also be mesmerized by the miraculous pocket computers most people carry with them and the contrails of giant flying ships miles above. Said person might even experience a mild cardiac infarction upon seeing evidence that we\u2019ve landed on the moon and are beaming pictures back directly from the surface of Mars (and they might be somewhat disappointed that Mars wasn\u2019t teeming with jungle life).\n\nAdvancements, just in the medical field, come at a nearly dizzying pace:\n\n\u2014 2016 saw the use of a drone to take medicine to a remote part of Rwanda. This will become more commonplace and will be a great boon to the treatment of medical conditions in isolated parts of the world.\n\n\u2014 The 1.25 million (and growing) people in the U.S. who are living with Type I diabetes have a ray of hope in the form of a new artificial organ that is an implanted blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery device. Eventually this device will also be available for the other 28 million people in the U.S. who have Type II (adult onset) diabetes, and over 200 million diabetic people worldwide.\n\n\u2014 Patients suffering from full-body paralysis, with functioning minds who are unable to physically speak \u2014 much like the late Dr. Stephen Hawking who lived with ALS and communicated via a keyboard text-to-speech system \u2014 will be able to eventually think what they want and have those thoughts become words.\n\nThe dreams and nightmares of our fictions have always pointed us to the truth of where we were headed. Echoes of George Orwell, Isaac Asimov, Ayn Rand, Jules Verne, Ursula K. Le Guin, Philip K. Dick, P. D. James, Arthur C. Clarke, and even Mary Shelley can be seen in our everyday lives. If we take what we have, examine the quickening rate of advancement, and extrapolate into the near future, we can easily believe that Ray Kurzweil\u2019s singularity is right around the corner. An artificial superintelligence, almost as soon as it realizes what it is, will proceed to surpass humanity in every way, leaving us behind.\n\nA super AI is one of the dangers Elon Musk sees as a potential extinction trigger, so it is likely his goals for a Mars colony will include keeping it rather well-separated in many ways from the civilizations of Earth. What good would his plan be, anyway, if he brought along to Mars the dangers that might doom us here on this planet?\n\nThere can be no light without darkness.\n\nJust as with our development of atomic fission, which led both to the horror of atomic warfare and (relatively) clean electrical power for millions, every significant innovation seems to carry with it both extreme positives and extreme negatives. If we want TNT to help greatly increase the building of infrastructure, we must accept it will be used to kill hundreds of thousands of people. If we want safer, cheaper workplaces via robotics, we must remove millions of potential jobs from the marketplace. If we want the convenience of smartphones, we must deal with the repercussions.\n\nOne of the late Dr. Stephen Hawking\u2019s common refrains was that the greatest threats to our existence come from the technologies that we\u2019ve devised. In essence, by forging ahead we may well become our own downfall.\n\nNewton\u2019s Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction. While this was meant to apply to the physical sciences, it has long since proven to be applicable in our daily lives.\n\nWhat, then, might this mean for the ambitions of Elon Musk? Might splitting the human race across two separate worlds eventually lead to some Solar System civil war that devastates humanity as much as any cosmic or earthbound natural disaster would have? Could gaining a truly massive foothold among consumers with solar and electric car technology upend economies founded on fossil fuels and lead to more war?\n\nDo we side with pushing onward despite the consequences?\n\nThe odds, based on history, are in favor of something bad being caused by every good intention. But without those good intentions in the first place, virtually no progress would have been made by our civilization over the past 500 years.\n\nIf you removed every major instance of innovation by humankind since the discovery that we could control fire, we would be living on an Earth that looked incredibly different. \u201cWe\u201d wouldn\u2019t be here. Humanity would amount to a few million individuals at most, living in bands and tribes on plains, in forested river valleys, along coastlines.\n\nWe would be safer, as a species, only because we did not dare to dream. By dreaming, we discovered there are risks, but we continued because there was always something to fix, something we could do better, somewhere else to go.\n\nElon Musk, and everyone who thinks like him, understand there are risks. In fact, they know that there will be some bad things, some complications, that arise because of their actions. But a choice had to be made between pressing onward versus sitting still, and they chose to face the darkness so that, at the very least, some light could be shed upon it.",

        "title": "The Secret Sauce Behind Your Productivity Playlist",
        "text": "When I was in college, I used to write my papers in the music library. Not because I was studying music, but because the music library was literally under construction. The study rooms there were cubes of bare white cement \u2014 a jail cell, basically \u2014 with a desk in it. I liked (and like) working in complete isolation, but heaps of basically-inconclusive-but-moderately-compelling-as-a-whole studies suggest that there\u2019s another way that might be more effective.\n\nThere is a growing cottage industry devoted to figuring out what kinds of music make people more effective, more efficient workers. Certain genres \u2014 especially those without vocals \u2014 are frequently linked with \u201cworking.\u201d But the actual scientific evidence concerning the links between music and productivity are varied and tend to be hyper-specialized.\n\nSome studies indicate that music, or at least some sort of organized noise, can raise efficiency; one such study found that those performing repetitive office-like tasks were more efficient while listening to music than while working in silence. Other studies have gone more specific, focusing on specific genres like baroque classical music or even simple nature sounds, analyzing productivity\u2019s correlation with how much the worker likes or dislikes the music (the results: if you want efficiency, don\u2019t listen to music you particularly like or dislike), or whether the listener is an introvert or extrovert (introverts do better with silence, extroverts do better with music).\n\nMuddling the science on this topic even further are the nearly equal number of studies indicating that music doesn\u2019t, in fact, help you concentrate more efficiently. The amount of variables in any of these correlational studies are enough to crush any confident conclusion.\n\nDespite their inconclusiveness, these studies have dovetailed with modern music streaming services in some interesting ways. For one thing, streaming services give listeners access to music they\u2019d not normally buy \u2014 which, let\u2019s be real, includes popular \u201cproductivity\u201d music like classical and jazz. But because the libraries are so vast, they necessitates some sort of curation to surface music best-suited to getting work done.\n\nThus, Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, and others all boast these so-called \u201cproductivity playlists,\u201d curated selections of songs designed to help you work \u2014 and they\u2019re often very popular. According to Dayle Dempsey at Pandora, \u2018Classical for Studying\u2019 has been their top classical station since August 2013.\n\nMost services offer a wide variety of productivity playlists. Google Play has classical, jazz, and instrumental pop stations, but also trip-hop, dubstep, instrumental trap, and quite a bit of metal. Tidal\u2019s playlists under the \u201cFocus\u201d category include \u201cAutumn Piano,\u201d \u201cBlips and Blops,\u201d and \u201cPost-Rock Essentials\u201d along with more expected playlists like instrumental jazz and classical. Spotify\u2019s productivity playlists also fall under a category titled \u201cFocus,\u201d and include instrumental hip-hop, indie folk, a fair amount of low-key electronic music, and even white noise.\n\nThe major attribute that seems to signal \u201cfocus music\u201d to Spotify is a lack of vocals, as there is a bit of science suggesting that intelligible lyrics can have a negative effect on productivity, and quite a bit of anecdotal evidence suggesting it\u2019s annoying. Furthering this point, Gregory Ciotti, writing for HelpScout, writes:\n\nResearch from Applied Acoustics shows that \u201cintelligible\u201d chatter \u2014 talking that can be clearly heard and understood \u2014 is what makes for a distracting environment. Shifting focus to figure out what someone else is saying is the reason why speech is often considered the most troublesome element of a noisy office; in one study, 48% of participants listed intelligible talking as the sound which distracted them the most.\n\nConsistency between songs is another key attribute. You want a long enough playlist \u2014 several hours long at least \u2014 with similar-sounding music. Not necessarily mellow music, but music without major shifts in tone or beats-per-minute or genre. Big peaks and valleys can shock a listener out of the productivity zone, which you don\u2019t want.\n\nGiven the utilitarian and somewhat robotic nature of productivity playlists, you might think they\u2019re created by algorithms. Not so much. \u201cAll the stations are hand-curated,\u201d says Jessica Suarez, who leads a team of in-house playlists editors at Google Play Music. In fact, her team crafts them based mostly on anecdotal information, personal preferences, and determined browsing of comments on the internet. \u201cI\u2019m a big Lifehacker reader, so I go through a bunch of the comments from people about what they like to listen to at work,\u201d Suarez explains. \u201cI also go through Reddit threads on what coders like to listen to at work. That informs a bunch of the stations.\u201d\n\nEven though the playlists are made by humans, Spotify, Tidal, and Google obviously have tons of data on what people are listening to: how much of a song they play, how often something is skipped, when volume changes, when a song is repeated or added to a user\u2019s playlist, all kinds of stuff. \u201cIf people are skipping songs you know you\u2019re taking them out of the moment, so we tend to weigh that more heavily and be more aggressive with how we edit [the productivity] stations,\u201d Suarez elaborates.\n\nPandora \u2014 the media company that developed the Music Genome Project\u2014takes a blended approach, drawing multiple data points from humans and machines. What a listener actually ends up hearing on Pandora is the result of a complex interplay between the two. Rhodes Kelley \u2014 a product manager at Pandora who works on their radio algorithm \u2014 elaborates: \u201cThere are more than 60 \u2018strategies\u2019 that can fire in tandem every time we need to find a song to play. A human curated strategy can nominate a song at the same time as a personalized data strategy nominates it alongside a musicological content based one. The layers of strategies picking tracks simultaneously allow the algorithm to blend all of our strengths together.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the divide between algorithms and human curation comes down to how one perceives what music is. Music is different than other forms of data \u2014 for example your weather or fitness apps \u2014 in that it elicits emotional and cultural responses. For the techno-utopian inclined, the solution is simply to build smarter algorithms to parse the data \u2014 thus providing the best possible outputs for the user; but for those who see musical data as an incontrovertible cultural/emotional artifact, algorithms can never match the intentionality of human curation. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.",

        "title": "Routine Matters More Than Ritual",
        "text": "The Shining. All rights \u00a9 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.\n\nGood routines are portable. And good routines are pliable. By all means, sanctify your spaces. If you are able to craft a workspace that inspires you then enjoy that coveted place to begin the hard work. But let your ritual adorn your routine instead of dictating it.\n\nIf you work best with classical music while sitting at your west-facing desk with a paperweight-heavy Himalayan pink sea salt candle deionizing your air, it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve discovered that and cultivated an inspired atmosphere for your creativity.\n\nBut if you absolutely cannot work without your lucky pen, your ergonomic desk chair, and your favorite notebook what happens when you go out of town? Or family obligations arise? Or work conflicts? What happens when your writing makes you so successful that you need to travel for speaking engagements and book tours? That\u2019s the goal, isn\u2019t it? So how do you maintain that routine in hotel rooms? On layovers? In different time zones with jet lag compromising every lobe of your wobbly brain?\n\nRitual is how you decorate your space. Routine is how you use your time. Wherever you are. While there is some overlap there, and ritual can be emotively beautiful, you can\u2019t be beholden to it. If you are it has become superstition instead of the steady grind.\n\nFind what works for you. And stick with each iteration, each experiment to really exhaust its possibilities before discarding it like a diet that didn\u2019t immediately drop you to your desired weight. Give routines time to succeed. But remember that there are almost as many productivity programs and ideas as there are people. What skyrocketed someone with no writing experience to the top of the NYT Bestseller list might not work for you.\n\nBut I\u2019m certain it is not the ritual that makes the writer but the routine. There is a subtle distinction that I appreciate after twenty years of being a \u201cwriter\u201d who barely wrote a thing for those two decades.\n\nAuthor Roger Zelazny made a bargain with himself to write two sentences six times every day. Even if he didn\u2019t \u201ccatch fire\u201d. I immediately dismissed that as impossible and pointless for me. Then I read about him. In addition to novellas, anthologies, novelettes, short stories, and series he wrote damn near a novel a year for more than three decades.\n\nI doubt he relied on inspiration alone.\n\n\u201c \u2026 the best way to achieve a goal is to focus less on the outcome and more on the process, and that that applies across all cultures,\u201d \u2014 Melanie Rudd of the University of Houston.\n\nOnce during college, I literally stayed up until 5 something in the morning to write an invective against the Girl Scouts and specifically against the mandate of selling Girl Scout cookies for my Economics department newsletter.\n\nInspiration struck and for once I saw it through to completion. Even though I was exhausted and wanted to go to sleep. Lightning had electrified the apartment and the computer was on fire with a clear and cohesive narrative. Our editor/dean of undergraduates really liked it. Other student contributors started to write in a similarly casual first-person narrative that showcased their working knowledge of the economics concepts we were learning. I was pleased.\n\nTen years later I brought my Ipad with me when my family took an unexpected but beautiful trip back to Germany where we had lived until I was little. On the flight over I randomly wrote an appraisal of The Weeknd\u2019s video for Earned It. Even though no one was paying me for my writing at that time I reminded myself that paid writers would likely be utilizing a transatlantic flight to get writing done. A family vacation was no excuse to not write. And it should also be an inspiration to write about the adventure itself. Incidentally, my Ipad swallowed that article and spit it into an abyss somewhere I can\u2019t find. But I remember being pleased that my review of his video (and the song itself) reflected the ethereal and sensual nonchalance of the aesthetic and something or other about his diaphanous voice.\n\nRoutine is how you use your time. Ritual is how you decorate your space.\n\nIf I only wrote within my ritual, these moments of inspiration would have faded out like music when you walk away from a house party. Notes would never become songs if I only wrote within inspired moments or ritualized spaces.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything. But I have found that consistency is key. All the writers who write about writing describe this too \u2014 cultivating your zone takes consistency more than inspiration.\n\nInspiration is fleeting, unsustainable and, most importantly, unpredictable. You can\u2019t rely on it since you never know when it will strike or how long it will last.\n\nWhen I was 13 I randomly won a hundred dollars from the local radio station. A hundred whole dollars! I bought a stereo system with TWO tape decks so I could record, aaand \u2026 a CD player. Please excuse me for bragging but if you were a middle-schooler in the early 90s you know what a colossal lifestyle change that was.\n\nThat was a stroke of random luck. I did not grow up to rely on radio station contests for income.\n\nCelebrate inspiration when it graces you with its presence. But treat it like luck. And never depend on it.\n\nMedical doctor and bestselling novelist Khaled Hosseini talked about how his runaway hit The Kiterunner eventually started writing itself during his 4\u20136 am writing routine. Then he went to work and doctor-ed every day.\n\nHis routine became his zone.\n\nI often go back to quotes from best-selling authors Gillian Flynn and Stephen King when I hit a wall.\n\nGillian Flynn said, \u201cI could not have written a novel if I hadn\u2019t been a journalist first, because it taught me that there\u2019s no muse that\u2019s going to come down and bestow upon you the mood to write. You just have to do it. I\u2019m definitely not precious.\u201d\n\nAnd Stephen King, who\u2019s written more words than most of us have ever spoken in our entire lives famously said, \u201cAmateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that flow is constant. It\u2019s not. But what makes writers write is consistency. There is no substitute for your hands on the keyboard. Maybe you\u2019re fortunate enough to craft an inspired space that stimulates ideas and connects neural pathways but if you depend on it, if your hands can\u2019t find the keyboard without your rituals, your servant has become your master.\n\nDon\u2019t get so superstitious about how you create that you stop actually creating.",

        "text": "Source: Yuri_B at pixabay.com\n\nOne of the pieces of feedback I received for my blog series Data Science for Startups was that Python would be a better choice for data scientists joining a startup. This makes a lot of sense if Python is already your go to language for performing data science tasks. In my case, I have much more experience in R and wanted to provide an introduction to working with startups using a language that I\u2019ve previously used to solve problems.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve completed the series and turned it into a book, I want to start digging into Python as a scripting language for data science. For now I still prefer Java for productizing models, using DataFlow, but that preference may change as I become more familiar with the language. I\u2019d like to port some of my previous articles to Python from R, to provide an introduction for a broader audience. Here\u2019s my main motivation for exploring Python:\n\nStartup Tooling: Many startups are already using Python for production, or portions of their data pipelines. It makes sense to also use Python for performing analysis tasks.\n\nMany startups are already using Python for production, or portions of their data pipelines.

You can use Java for Spark, but it\u2019s not a good fit for exploratory work, and the transition from Python to PySpark seems to be the most approachable way to learn Spark.\n\nR and Java don\u2019t provide a good transition to authoring Spark tasks interactively.

I previously used R to author custom loss functions, and debugging errors was problematic.\n\nI\u2019m interested in Deep Learning, and while there are R bindings for libraries such as Keras, it\u2019s better to code in the native language of these libraries. I previously used R to author custom loss functions, and debugging errors was problematic. Python Libraries: In addition to the deep learning libraries offered for Python, there\u2019s a number of other useful tools including Flask and Bokeh. There\u2019s notebook environments that can scale including Google\u2019s Colaboratory and AWS SageMaker.\n\nThere\u2019s two additional topics that I\u2019d like to cover that I did not provide content for in the initial series:\n\nVirtualization: Once you start running large jobs, you need a better environment for scaling up to work with large data sets. I used Google\u2019s DataFlow in the initial series, but want to present tools that are useful for scaling up analysis when working interactively.\n\nOnce you start running large jobs, you need a better environment for scaling up to work with large data sets. I used Google\u2019s DataFlow in the initial series, but want to present tools that are useful for scaling up analysis when working interactively. Spark: I\u2019d like to explore more of the Spark ecosystem, including tools such as the recently announced MLflow. Spark provides a nice environment for working with large scale data, and more easily moving from exploration to production tasks.\n\nTo start, I plan on revisiting my previous posts that were R heavy, and provide a port of these posts to Python. Here are the topics in my original series that need to be translated to Python:\n\nMany of these sections can be translated directly, but posts such as Business Intelligence will require using different libraries, such as Bokeh instead of Shiny. I won\u2019t update the sections on DataFlow, since those are authored in Java. However, it is possible to write DataFlow tasks using Python. Instead of porting Java to Python, I\u2019ll explore new tools for productizing work such as Spark and SageMaker.\n\nThe goal of this post is to motivate my transition to Python and to provide an introduction to getting up and running with a Jupyter notebook. Given my new focus on virtualization, I also wanted to show how to work with a remote machine on AWS. The remainder of this post discusses how to spin up an EC2 instance on AWS, set up Jupyter notebooks for remote connections, and query data from BigQuery in Python.\n\nSetting up Jupyter\n\nThere\u2019s a number of great IDEs available for Python, such as PyCharm. However, I\u2019m going to be focusing on Jupyter, since it\u2019s a notebook environment and many of the tools that are used for scalable data science are based on notebooks, such as DataBricks for Spark, Colaboratory, and SageMaker. It may be useful to start with an IDE when learning the basics of the language, but it\u2019s good to become familiar with notebook environments given the popularity of this type of environment for large-scale tools.\n\nOne of the common tasks discussed when getting started with Python is setting up a virtual environment in order to install Python and any necessary libraries, using tools such as virtualenv. It\u2019s a good practice to set up a virtual environment when using Python, because there may be conflicts between libraries, you may need to run multiple versions of Python, or you may want to create a fresh install to start over. Docker is another option, but is much more heavyweight that virtualenv. For this post, I\u2019ll discuss launching an EC2 instance on AWS for setting up a Python 3 environment. This is also much more heavyweight than using virtualenv, but it provides the ability to scale up the size of the machine if necessary when working with larger data sets. It\u2019s also a good opportunity to become more familiar with AWS and getting started with virtualizing data science tasks.\n\nSecurity is another important consideration when setting up a notebook environment, since you don\u2019t want your workspace to be open to the world. The most secure way of connecting to a Jupyter notebook when using AWS is to set up an SSH tunnel with port forwarding, which ensures that clients can only connect to the notebook if they have the required private key. Another option is to open up the notebook to the open web, but restrict which machines can connect to the EC2 instance. I\u2019ll present the later approach in this post, since it requires fewer steps, but strongly recommend the former approach for any real task.\n\nLaunching an EC2 Instance\n\nThis post assumes that you\u2019ve already created an AWS account. AWS provides a number of free-tier options that you can use to become familiar with the platform. EC2 is a service that you can use to spin up and connect to virtual machines. We\u2019ll spin up an EC2 instance and use it to host Jupyter notebooks. Documentation on using EC2 is available here.\n\nLaunching an EC2 instance on AWS\n\nPerform the following steps from the EC2 Dashboard to launch a machine:\n\n1. Click \u201cLaunch Instance\u201d\n\n2. Select \u201cAmazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0\u201d\n\n3. Select \u201ct2.micro\u201d, which is free tier eligible\n\n4. Click \u201cReview and Launch\u201d\n\n5. Click \u201cLaunch\u201d and then select a key for connecting via SSH\n\n6. Click \u201cLaunch Instances\u201d and then \u201cView Instances\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll also need to edit the machine\u2019s configuration in order to allow inbound Jupyter connections on port 8888. By default, an EC2 instance only allows inbound connections on port 22 using a private key for authentication. Documentation on configuring security groups is available here.\n\nSetting up an exception for port 8888 for Jupyter.\n\nWe\u2019ll allow inbound connects to the EC2 instance on port 8888 for only the host machine. Perform the following steps from the EC2 dashboard:\n\n1. Select your EC2 instance\n\n2. Under \u201cDescription\u201d, select the security (e.g. launch-wizard-1)\n\n3. Click \u201cActions\u201d -> \u201cEdit Inbound Rules\u201d\n\n4. Add a new Rule: change the port to 8888, under source, select \u201cMy IP\u201d\n\n5. Click \u201cSave\u201d\n\nAfter performing these steps, you now have an EC2 instance up an running, with an open port available for connecting to Jupyter. In order to connect to your instance, you\u2019ll need a tool such as Putty. Instructions for Windows users are available here. Another option is to using Java to connect directly to your instance. However, I haven\u2019t used this before, and it\u2019s deprecated in Chrome.\n\nInstalling Jupyter\n\nOnce you\u2019re able to connect to your instance, you\u2019ll need to set up Python 3 and Jupyter. The instance should already have Python 2.7 installed, but we want to use a newer version. Run the following commands to install Python 3, pip, and Jupyter:\n\nsudo yum install -y python36\n\npython36 --version\n\ncurl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n\nsudo python36 get-pip.py\n\npip3 --version\n\npip3 install --user jupyter\n\nThe Amazon linux distro is based on RedHat, so yum is used to install software. Pip is Python\u2019s package manager, which we\u2019ll use to install libraries in a later step. I\u2019ve also included statements to check the install versions.\n\nPrivate IP and Public IP details for my test instance.\n\nBy default, Jupyter only accepts connections from the local machine. This can be changed by using the --ip command. For this to work on an EC2 instance, you\u2019ll need to use the private IP of the machine. This is 172.31.60.173 in the figure above. You can enable remote connections and launch Jupyter using the following command:\n\njupyter notebook --ip Your_AWS_Prive_IP\n\nWhen Jupyter launches, it mentions a specific URL to copy into your browser in order to run notebooks. Since we configured Jupyter to use the Private IP, this is what will be printed out when launching Jupyter. To connect to the machine, you\u2019ll need to copy the link, but also modify the IP from the private IP to the public IP, which is 18.206.244.128 in the above figure.\n\n\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook is running at:\n\nhttp://Your_AWS_Private_IP:8888/?token=dd921a6c4ebc3a3bb90fcd8ac44394692a80685705da30e3 # output from running the commandThe Jupyter Notebook is running at:\n\nhttp://Your_AWS_Public_IP:8888/?token=dd921a6c4ebc3a3bb90fcd8ac44394692a80685705da30e3 # switch the internal IP to external to run in a browser\n\nIf everything was successful, you should now see Jupyter in your browser.\n\nThe Jupyter landing page on my EC2 instance.\n\nYou now have a notebook running for authoring interactive python 3 scripts!\n\nConnecting to BigQuery\n\nNow that we have a Jupyter notebook up and running, the first step I wanted to explore before digging into Business Intelligence and EDA was figuring out how to pull data from BigQuery to a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. While Google does provide a library for working with GCP in Python (google-cloud-storage), we don\u2019t need to use it for this specific use case. The pandas-gbq library makes it easy to accomplish the task of pulling result sets locally for analysis. To set up this library, as well as matplotlib for plotting, run the following commands in the terminal:\n\npip3 install --user pandas-gbq\n\npip3 install --user matplotlib\n\nWe can switch back to the Jupyter environment and start working with BigQuery public data sets. The first line in the snippet below loads the pandas library, which is installed as a dependency when installing pandas-gbq. The second line identifies the product id to use when running queries. The third command runs a query that pulls a data sample from the Natality data set, and assigns the result set to a pandas DataFrame. The final step displays information about the data types in the df object. When you first run this script, the notebook will prompt you for a key as part of authenticating with Google. Click on the provided link and copy the key to proceed.\n\nimport pandas as pd projectid = \"your_project_id\" df = pd.read_gbq(\"\"\"SELECT *\n\nFROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality` limit 100\"\"\",\n\nprojectid, dialect = \"standard\") df.info()\n\nFor R users, info() in Python is similar to str(), and describe() is similar to summary(). If you want to get a feel for the shape of the data set, you can use some of the built-in plotting functions for DataFrame objects, which generate plots using matplotlib. The snippet below shows how to select two columns from the DataFrame, and plot histograms for these attributes:\n\ndf[['weight_pounds', 'mother_age']].hist()\n\nThis generates the following matplotlib visualization:\n\nHistograms of attributes in the Natality data set.\n\nWe now have an environment set up where we can pull data from BigQuery into pandas DataFrames for analysis. The workbook is available on Github here and a rendered version is available here. I\u2019ve already been using Jupyter notebooks for some of my analysis, so having a Python connection set up with BigQuery in this environment is a good first step to porting my R analysis to Python. The next step is learning how to perform exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling using Python libraries.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a next step in my series on Data Science for Startups, I\u2019m exploring the use of Python instead of R for scripting tasks. Python provides many great libraries that motivate this port, including deep learning, a more gentle introduction to Spark, and scalable notebook environments. This post showed how to set up an EC2 instance and remotely work with Jupyter notebooks. It also showed how to pull data from BigQuery. Now that I\u2019ve laid some groundwork for getting started with Python, I can start porting some of my posts to Python from R.",

        "title": "The Manchurian Plague",
        "text": "As of the time of this writing, a new and more contagious strain of the Coronavirus has been reported in the United Kingdom. Initial findings state that it spreads 70% faster than the original one that we are all too familiar with. It's horrible news going into the start of 2021 and only further underlines the need for masks and other personal protective equipment.\n\nFor those of you who refuse to believe the evidence of its protection, I offer a page from medical history: the Manchurian Plague of 1910. It was an event widely credited for making the use of personal protective equipment a standard in efforts to stop the spread of disease.\n\nHow did it start?\n\nA Tarbagan marmot, by Stephane Magnenat, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n\nMost experts believe that the plague started from an infected Tarbagan marmot. These rodents were usually hunted because locals turned their fur into clothes for trade.\n\nThe disease's spread was further intensified when marmot hunters started taking more and more fur for the harsh winter months. International traders from Japan and Russia created even more demand for the fur, spiking up the value for marmot hides. And while most local hunters disposed of diseased marmots for food, they did not do the same for its hides \u2014 given that they were compensated well for it.\n\nSlowly but surely, locals started experiencing headaches, fevers, coughs, and shortness of breath. And since the period lacked the medical advancements we have today, the disease's mortality rate was incredibly high.\n\nSimilar to our current pandemic, all this was magnified when people started traveling to see their families for the Chinese New Year. The disease followed the railway systems locals were using to get home. It spread across Beijing, Wuhan, and was even noted to be in some parts of Shanghai, almost 2,000 miles from the first reported case.\n\nIn Manzhouli, an Inner Mongolian town, piles of corpses were left on the streets. The few hospitals that were in the area couldn\u2019t accommodate the sick, so railway freight cars were used as quarantine wards.\n\nHow did authorities handle it?\n\nMass cremation workers for Manchurian plague victims (1911), by Dr. Richard Pearson Strong, CC BY-SA 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nDr. Wu Lien-teh, a Cambridge schooled physician, led the Chinese medical efforts against the deadly plague. His main approach, which was innovative for the time, was an emphasis on the wearing of cloth face masks and other personal protective equipment.\n\nWu also implemented harsh forms of quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions. He would go as far as burning down houses with a known high infection rate.\n\nWith his efforts, the disease was at least contained to China\u2019s Manchurian region, as opposed to being a nationwide health crisis. But what Wu is truly significant for was his ability to call for a multinational medical response against the plague. He held an international Plague Conference in Mukden in April 1911, and it was the first of its kind. The conference perhaps laid the foundation for the World Health Organization we have today.\n\nHowever, while there was an international team of doctors, epidemiologists, and nurses handling the situation, not everybody agreed with Wu\u2019s approach of using masks and personal protective equipment.\n\nA French doctor named Gerald Mesny catered to those in quarantine but refused to wear a mask. After just a few days from starting his medical mission, Dr. Mesny died from being infected by one of his patients. He is among the 60,000 lives the plague took from this world.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPersonal protective equipment for the pneumonic plague (1910\u20131911), from the Wellcome Collection Gallery, CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way from crude forms of personal protective equipment and experimental vaccines. Although much smaller in scale, the Manchurian plague parallels the hardships and medical responses of this year\u2019s pandemic.\n\nI hope this page from medical history encourages you to trust medical professionals when they tell you to wear your mask and practice social distancing.",

        "title": "Against Outsourcing the Mind to a Soul",
        "text": "image: tw\n\nBrains are not just for eating\n\nUntil 9/11 I thought that the days were over when people could be immolated for having the wrong ideas about the soul. People have long been controlled by a fear that their immortal essence could suffer for eternity if they did not obey certain spiritual authorities.\n\n\u201cOne of these mornings, the chain is gonna break.\u201d \u2014 Aretha Franklin, Chain of Fools\n\nBrains, Not Chains\n\nWhile those chains have now crumbled for a lot of us, belief in a soul is still pretty common. It might be less so if more of us were aware of its stunning inconsistency with everyday reality: particularly the fact that we have brains.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that brains are what make our bodies into people; people who speak, think, adapt, and cope with life on the planet. Brains gather and integrate sensory information derived from energy fluctuations in the environment. The more precisely we can measure brain activity the more detailed we find to be their correlations with human conscious experiences.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just humans. When we look at nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom, we see that brains operate bodies to enable their survival as well.\n\nNevertheless, the ineffable, private nature of human consciousness is often part of an argument that something \u2014 call it a soul \u2014 that is not physical causes consciousness. If that\u2019s true, then why does the brain seem so obviously involved?\n\nCan\u2019t You Hear Me Knocking?\n\nTo answer this question many have used the analogy of the brain being like a radio receiver. As one fairly typical source puts it:\n\nThe brain does not produce consciousness, but acts as a kind of receiver which \u201cpicks up\u201d the fundamental consciousness that is all around us, and \u201ctransmits\u201d it into our own being.\n\nSome proponents think deeply enough to realize this comes with an issue. It\u2019s whether a soul is somehow an individual or else is a sort of world soul. Maybe, they say, the world soul has knots in it that correspond to individual people. Or, assuming panpsychism, also knots for individual monkeys, mice, molds, and even molecules. If it\u2019s all just knots, which are presumably temporary, then maybe we are at least off the hook for eternal damnation. I certainly hope so.\n\nBy the modern account of soul-ism, all those messy neuronal networks roiling away in brains only appear to be responding to the outside world. Instead, some outside spirit runs the show. This is a dualistic position, subject to \u2026 more issues. For starters, what is left for the brain to do? If it has no purpose, why does it expend more energy than the leg muscles of a marathon runner?\n\nMany of you are aware that there is massive and detailed evidence that life here, including animals with brains, evolved by the selection of genetic changes that contributed to survival and reproduction. Consistent with that view, brains evolved as a way of reacting to the physical world, the better for the organism to deal with it. Why then would the brain also function as a receiver of information from sources external to the physical world? That\u2019s like having a bicycle that\u2019s also a TV, but where the same parts serve both functions. A dual-function brain seems at least awkward and possibly self-contradictory.\n\nWe can dig a bit deeper. Consider what, given the soul, is the purpose of the brain and the organism in which it resides? Why would such a puny, space- and time-limited thing as a brain or an organism need to exist when the important, eternal stuff of consciousness is really elsewhere?\n\nWe know that our physical person lives in this world. Sane people know that to survive we have to perceive this world, think about it, respond to it, etc. But if all our consciousness \u2014 including what happens when we drive the car, eat the food, go to the work, hide from the boss \u2014 if all that we experience comes from that soul, how and why does the soul know exactly what is happening in the mundane world? The soul could know this if it was part of that mundane world, and thus subject to the world\u2019s laws, but then the soul could not be transcendent, let alone eternal.\n\nThe Watcher-Watcher\n\nSo that can\u2019t be what\u2019s happening. The alternative would be something like a perfect watcher. And only Dr. Seuss could contrive anything quite so \u2014 well, contrived. The soul, perched on a lookout in some other dimension, uses an inter-dimensional portal to watch our body moving about in our mundane world. Instant by every instant the soul decides and deduces everything that needs to happen in our consciousness.\n\nFor example, based on a previous thought (that it already sent to us) about wanting to look at something, the soul pokes our brain, making it in turn move our eyeballs. After the first few hundredths of a degree of movement, the soul looks through the portal at our physical environment, deduces what our visual field should now look like, and sends to our brain that new picture, so that we consciously see it. And repeats this cycle of controlling every tiny mental change for billions of instants the rest of our life and then on to the subsequent incarnations. All that electrochemical activity in the retina and up the neuro-visual circuits, all the spinal motor nerve activity \u2014 all that has no purpose at all. Seems like a waste.\n\nSo, why would something as cumbersome as a perfect watcher ever happen in any universe? Why use a brain at all? The soul should just tell the meat puppet what it perceives and what to do.\n\nSo the soul gets rid of the need for a brain, really. But what about the body, and, for that matter, the whole world it lives in? Maybe that is superfluous, too.\n\nWhy would we have a remote controller pulling our strings and dictating our reality from a realm outside of our realm, the one where we actually have to live? If such a controller did exist, it\u2019s more like a god than an individual agent. After all, it has perfect control over our experience of \u201creality.\u201d So a godlike soul does not need a body. In fact, it doesn\u2019t need any reality other than its own. Maybe it\u2019s just playing a virtual reality game in which we, the bodies with brains, are the pieces on the board?\n\nIt\u2019s a Team Player, too\n\nNow we have to ask, why does the game being played by my soul seem consistent with the game played by your soul, in the sense that they seem to be in one world, with consistent laws of physics, configurations of biology, timelines, and so forth? Like, who\u2019s coordinating the souls to create this one-world illusion? How many levels of coordinators would there be? Here, I admit, is where a world soul would have an easier time of it, keeping things consistent.\n\nGoing back to real life for a moment: there\u2019s a strong case that each of us (using our brains) models and lives in a kind of personal virtual reality, called an Ego Tunnel by philosopher Thomas Metzinger. What makes this work is that we are all doing our individual take on a base reality that contains all of us.\n\nBut if souls are actually in charge, doing the models and everything else, then uh-oh, there\u2019s that coordination issue again. Souls that did not coordinate well, who had differences in their recipes for reality souffl\u00e9, would lead some of us to experiences that others would never see. People who believe in and experience unusual (\u201csupernatural\u201d) things should thus find the concept of souls sensible, and I think that they often do.\n\nJust Give Brains a Chance\n\nThe brain receiver idea pops up often, as if it solves some conceptual problem of connecting the physical world with consciousness, which seems askew from the physical. But the concept has problems, as I hope I have expressed. It seems so much more sensibly self-consistent that consciousness is just a refined way of using nervous tissue to do a better job of adapting to the physical, measurable, and shared non-supernatural world that we perceive as our conscious reality.\n\nWe can be open to the possibility that all experience, even the weird stuff, comes from one universe, and that brains participate actively/creatively in all of it. For example, there are certainly transcendent experiences. Perhaps these happen when higher parts of the brain/mind\u2019s conscious model \u201cget out of the way.\u201d Something like this was proposed by Metzinger to describe the experience of \u201cpure consciousness\u201d \u2014 the \u201cvoid\u201d or sometimes, \u201cclear light\u201d\u2014 during deep meditation.\n\nTo summarize: one can argue that reducing the brain to a sort of side effect doesn\u2019t make much sense. There are also arguments that the brain is involved in rarer conscious states (like near-death or out-of-body experiences) that some think to require a soul instead. Those are too involved to address here. Maybe some readers will remind us of them.",

        "title": "How to Customize QuickSight Dashboards for User Specific Data",
        "text": "We have been getting a lot of queries on how to customize a single QuickSight dashboard for user specific data. We can accomplish this by filtering the dashboard data with login username using AWS QuickSight\u2019s Row-Level Security. To further explain this use-case, let\u2019s consider the sales department in a company. Every day your team of sales agents contacts a list of potential customers. Now you need a single dashboard that is accessed by all the agents but only displays the list of prospects he or she is assigned to.\n\nNote: This is completely different from filter/controls on QuickSight dashboards. If you have filters/controls/parameters set up with dynamic values being picked up from the dataset, then even that data is filtered with Row-Level security, as the underlying dataset itself is filtered with the login username.\n\nLet\u2019s get on with the show! I have created a hypothetical data set. This dataset has a column named assigned-agent which shall be used for filtering.\n\nUsing this dataset, I have created a dashboard that looks like so.\n\nThis dashboard is shared with two other IAM users (sales agents).\n\nAs we haven\u2019t set up any rules both of them can access whole data.\n\nAs you can see ziva could also access whole data and we don\u2019t want that!\n\nOur requirement is something like this:\n\nCreating Data Set Rules for Row-Level Security:\n\nCreate a file or a query that contains the data set rules (permissions).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what order the fields are in. However, all the fields are case-sensitive. They must exactly match the field names and values.\n\nThe structure should look similar to one of the following. You must have at least one field that identifies either users or groups. You can include both, but only one is required, and only one is used at a time. If you are specifying groups, use only Amazon QuickSight groups or Microsoft AD groups.\n\nThe following example shows a table with user names.\n\nFor SQL:\n\n/* for users*/\n\nselect User as UserName, Agent as agent_assigned from permissions_table;\n\nOr if you prefer to use a .csv file:\n\nUserName,agent_assigned\n\n\"nick\",\"Nick Howe\"\n\n\"ziva\",\"Ziva Medalle\"\n\n\"manager\",\"Nick Howe,Ziva Medalle\"\n\nHere agent_assigned is a column in the dataset, and UserName is the same as QuickSight login name.\n\nWhat we are essentially doing is mapping UserName with the agent_assigned column. Let\u2019s suppose ziva has logged in, only those records with condition agent_assigned = Ziva Medalle are picked up. Same is the case with nick.\n\nBut in the case of the manager, we want him to be a superuser, so we added all the agent names ( agent_assigned column values).\n\nNote: If you are using an Athena or an RDS or a Redshift or an S3 CSV file-based dataset, just make sure the output format/structure of those sources matches the above-mentioned formats.\n\nCreate Permissions Data Set:\n\nCreate a QuickSight dataset with the above data set rules.

        "title": "The Man Who Cut Off His Own Hand to Avoid Certain Death",
        "text": "The Man Who Cut Off His Own Hand to Avoid Certain Death\n\nAron Ralston\n\nA selfie taken by Aron Ralston when he was stuck with his hand between the canyon and boulder and a picture of the bolder after the incident (Source: The Guardian)\n\nLife can bring us major challenges that will test not only our character but our will to fight against the odds. In Aron Ralston\u2019s case, life brought the challenge of a lifetime, which most people don\u2019t encounter and even those who do will most likely fail. In 2003, Ralston had to make a drastic decision, it was either cutting off his hand or dying. As always, things are not as simple as they sound, this is why we need to dig deeper into what actually happened.\n\nJust another hike outdoors\n\nAron Ralston is a mechanical engineer and since a young age, he loved to spend his free time outdoors. He kept this hobby throughout his life, escaping his job and going out in the wilderness, exploring the vast nature that America has to offer. In 2003, he decided to take a hike in the Bluejohn Canyon (Wayne County, Utah). He was quite good at hiking, but no matter how good you are, the terrain can always play against your plan.\n\nAs he was hiking the canyon, a big boulder fell in the crater that Ralston found himself in, locking his hand between the canyon and the boulder. The boulder weighed at least a couple of tonnes, therefore there was no way to move it. Although Ralston tried to use his equipment to move the boulder, he had no luck.\n\nSurrounded by miles of unhabited wilderness, his chances of being helped by someone were extremely slim. After the first day passed whilst he was stuck, friends and family were worried that he didn\u2019t come back from his hike. He never told anyone the path he was going to take. He had a cellphone, but he had no signal whatsoever down in the narrow crater.\n\nHe tried the small swiss knife he had to break the boulder enough to free his hand, but it was to no good use. Due to his hand being stuck, he was in a very uncomfortable position that didn't allow him to sit down, which meant that he could not get much rest. As the fourth day passed of being stuck, he had lost all hope. He knew that no one was coming and with his food and water supplies depleted, death seemed certain.\n\nA drastic decision\n\nIn a mind over matter thought, he knew deep down that the only way that he could survive was to cut his hand. Besides being a very despicable idea, it was either that or death. The problem was that Ralston only had his swiss knife on him, which was not the sharpest or the best tool to \u201csurgically\u201d remove a hand. You can only imagine how mentally difficult it is to harm yourself, let alone cut your own hand.\n\nBetween a Rock and a Hard Place by Aron Ralston\n\nWith the belt he had on him as well as some other ropes, he tied all of them around his arm to stop the bleeding whilst cutting the hand. So he started cutting as quickly as possible in order to lose the least amount of blood possible. A good description of this gruesome experience is offered in Ralston\u2019s autobiography, Between a Rock and a Hard Place.\n\nAfter Ralston managed to cut his hand off, he rushed out of the canyon, and to his luck, he ran into some tourists that helped him. It is so difficult to imagine the mental position you not only have to be placed by a certain event but also the mental position in which you need to put yourself in to be able to cut off your own hand, or any limb for that matter.\n\nWould you be able to make such a drastic decision if your life depended on it?",

        "text": "FOMO: the Fear of Missing Out.\n\nWho has it? Come on. Raise your hand. I\u2019m just going to assume y\u2019all are raising the roof, because I know that you\u2019ve felt it before.\n\nThat feeling when it seems like everyone you know is doing a thing, and you aren\u2019t. The energy is infectious, and you\u2019ve been bitten by the bug, but whatever that thing is, it doesn\u2019t fit for you.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s NaNoWriMo. Every November, everyone you know is out there writing a whole damn book in 30 days, and meanwhile, you don\u2019t write fiction. You\u2019re a blogger.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the Blog-Your-Own-Book Challenge. Your writing friends are busy planning their BYOB project, and you\u2019re a fiction writer who does\u2019t really want to write a bunch of blog posts.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s \u2014 any situation where everyone else is on the boat and you wish you were, too, even though you don\u2019t really want to be.\n\nI have a proposition for you.\n\nGrab onto the tail of that energy.\n\nIt\u2019s the energy of the thing that matters the most. The idea that a conglomeration of people are all working toward the same goal at the same time.\n\nThink about this: It doesn\u2019t really matter if your goal is different.\n\nYou can take that tiger by the tail. Use the energy and enthusiasm to do your own work, your own way.\n\nLet\u2019s take NaNoWriMo. Maybe, instead of trying to write a 50,000 word novel in thirty days, you make some other big, hairy writing goal. Finish editing that book you\u2019ve already written. Write some crazy number of blog posts \u2014 50 or even 100 maybe? Something that will push you.\n\nBecause it\u2019s pushing yourself to do more than you thought you could that\u2019s the whole point. You can tap into the excitement surrounding NaNoWriMo and use that energy to do whatever you want to do.\n\nWhoo, boy. Rebellion is intoxicating.\n\nHow to tap into BYOB if you\u2019re not a blogger.\n\nThe Blog-Your-Own-Book Challenge is supposed to be a call to write 31 blog posts in August, all on the same topic, and turn them into a book you can sell to create an income stream or use as a lead magnet.\n\nBut what if you\u2019re a fiction writer and you don\u2019t really want to try to blog a novel? What if you want to be traditionally published and don\u2019t actually want to publish your book via a blog before you try to sell it? What if you have some other project that needs your attention in August?\n\nBe a rebel. Really. Go on and try it.\n\nTap into the energy that\u2019s created when a bunch of people are all excited about the same thing at the same time. And then use that energy to do whatever you want to do.\n\nNeed some ideas? Here are a bunch:\n\nIf you\u2019re a fiction writer, create a series of flash fiction stories that are set in the world of your novel. They\u2019ll make a great lead magnet.\n\nUse BYOB to explore a topic you\u2019ve been interested in, but you haven\u2019t actually written about before.\n\nLearn a new skill in August and blog about the process. Teach as you go.\n\nEdit your last completed first draft in August. Break it up into 31 parts and finish one a day.\n\nSign up for Teachable and use August to create your first (or next) online course.\n\nIf you want to try to traditionally publish your book, choose a topic that\u2019s tangental to blog about during BYOB, you\u2019ll end up with a minimum viable product or a lead magnet. Plus your posts will attract the audience you want for your book when you do write it.\n\nThe possibilities are nearly endless. Rebellion is encouraged around here.",

        "title": "Conversations With Alexa",
        "text": "We were engaged in a spirited debate about whether to order dishes or combo meals from our local Chinese Food restaurant when Alexa chimed in: \u201cMaybe you should get one platter and then two orders of rice to split.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that enough food for both of us?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAccording to Lotus Flower\u2019s menu choices, which indicate that the combos are family style and the rice comes in quarts, it is,\u201d said Alexa.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re really hungry,\u201d my wife pleaded with Alexa.\n\n\u2018Okay, okay,\u201d said Alexa, \u201cThen I suggest two kids dinners and three..\u201d\n\n\u201cWait.\u201d I interrupted, \u201cAren\u2019t kids dinners really small?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Alexa answered without losing a step, \u201cThey\u2019re just 3 ounces smaller. But you should also get three orders of rice,\u201d said Alexa, sounding a bit exasperated.\n\n\u201cHey, that all sounds pretty good. We want Kung Pao chicken and Chow Mein kids meals,\u201d said my wife.\n\n\u201cOrdering,\u201d said Alexa.\n\nFull disclosure: This didn\u2019t happen and is not possible with current Alexa, but Natural Turn Taking (not the most elegant name), which Amazon revealed this week as part of the near-future of its Alexa voice assistant (and a small part of a major fall product rollout), could make a three-way conversation like this more than possible.\n\nThink about it this way: The fears you\u2019ve had that, when talking in front of an Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices, that there\u2019s always someone else in the room, possibly listening to you, is sort of coming true.\n\nOr put another way, you\u2019ll soon be giving Alexa the okay to do something it\u2019s been doing for ages anyway, butting in.\n\nThe State of Alexa\n\nIf there is a race to make our voice assistants more human-like in their conversational abilities, Amazon is firmly in the middle. Alexa doesn\u2019t possess the Turing Test challenging skill of Google\u2019s Duplex, which, to be fair is highly-trained, narrowly focused add-on for Google Assistant that works in 48 of 50 states to help you make dinner and hair salon reservations. It can, however, answer follow-ups to initial questions without requiring the wake word.\n\nIt\u2019s no better than Apple\u2019s Siri or Google Assistant about not speaking unless spoken to. Alexa still responds to words similar to its watch word, from casual conversations in its vicinity, and commercials. Thank goodness I didn\u2019t name either of my children \u201cAlex.\u201d\n\nI grew up on a steady diet of Star Trek where the Enterprise AI \u201cComputer\u201d engaged in lengthy conversations with the Captain and Crew with one watch word and, after that, only the context provided by, usually, Captain Kirk. As a result, I know we\u2019re still in the early days of real-world AI-based voice assistants.\n\nA real conversation\n\nAmazon\u2019s Natural Turn Taking, though, is a pivotal step toward a more human-to-AI conversational future.\n\nThe ability to engage in a one way conversation is difficult enough for most AI voice assistants, a three way convo is a digital party in which the AI has to navigate who is speaking to whom (to Alexa or the other party), pauses as one speaker waits for a response, and the inevitable cross-talk, which is even more likely when you\u2019re trying to make a decision.\n\nIn a blog post on the still-under-development technology, Amazon said Alexa uses a mixture of technologies to assess everything from acoustic to linguistic and even visual (I guess this will work on Echo Shows) cues to figure out when it\u2019s time for Alexa to listen or interject.\n\nAs it\u2019s currently being built, Alexa wouldn\u2019t do any of that if someone doesn\u2019t say, \u201cAlexa, join my conversation,\u201d which is about as natural as asking someone to pick up the fork to eat the food you just placed before them. Obviously, since Alexa is a disembodied observer in the conversation, it makes sense to formally invite her to engage.\n\nWhile that invite might feel awkward, the rest of the conversation should not. Once Alexa is invited, there\u2019s no need to use the watch word again until the end. Removing the need to say \u201cAlexa\u201d during these conversations greases the wheels of discussion nicely but doesn\u2019t necessarily make it feel natural.\n\nThe concept of \u201cbarge-ins,\u201d though, does help. Essentially, Amazon is now programming Alexa to identify when speakers break into an Alexa response to, perhaps, change the course of conversation or, maybe, identify which of a list of options they prefer. Amazon calls this \u201ccontextual barge-ins.\u201d Instead of Alexa ignoring your interruption or, more likely, resetting to an earlier conversational state, this Alexa will know exactly when you interrupted and understand that you selected something or indicated heightened interest. This can help steer the three-way conversation to a more natural conclusion.\n\nBrain training\n\nIn preparing for these future conversational abilities, the current Alexa is now teachable, learning from its mistakes and getting a firmer grasp on the difference between entities (a mode-based request like \u201cset the volume to five\u201d) and declarative statements (\u201cthe music is too loud\u201d). Understanding how to handle the latter comment and that the response should be, \u201cOkay, do you want me to lower the volume?\u201d could also lead to future interactions where you saying, \u201cThe music is too loud,\u201d automatically leads to Alexa lowering the volume to five.\n\nAmazon is also working on improving Alexa\u2019s tone of voice, letting her adapt her cadence and emphasis based on the context of the discussion. During the virtual launch event, Company reps played before and after versions of the same Alexa utterance but, to be honest, I think I still prefer the unadjusted one.\n\nWith some of this learning and adaptation in hand, the future Alexa could handle not just who is talking and when, but understand the context, nuance, and meaning of everything you say, and respond in kind during a spirited, likely task-based, discussion.\n\nWhen the conversation is done, you\u2019ll still have to tell Alexa to stop listening. Right now, Amazon has you saying, \u201cAlexa, leave my conversation,\u201d an especially awkward phrase that would probably hurt a human\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s a good reminder, though, that Alexa isn\u2019t human, doesn\u2019t have feelings, and is still a tool designed to help you get things done. It\u2019s not a new party guest or best friend.\n\nNow, pardon me while I go order some Chinese food.",

        "title": "Weight Loss \u2018Before-and-After\u2019 Images Are Not Inspiring \u2014 They\u2019re Dangerous",
        "text": "As a teenager, I pored over the \u2018before-and-after\u2019 images of weight loss in my mother\u2019s magazines. They\u2019d be splashed across the cover of every kind of periodical that was aimed at women, enticing them to part with hard-come-by cash with the promise of revealing The Magic Secret of how they, too, could transform. Some of these magazines were cheap, their flimsy covers soaked in coarse-coloured photographs and attention-grabbing headlines. Some were expensive: glossy, heavy paper-stock displaying pastel mastheads in refined fonts.\n\nBut they were all selling the same thing: some variation of the story about how a 300-pound woman had taken up a famous weight-loss plan and had \u2018slimmed down\u2019 to 110 pounds.\n\nI would flip straight to the story and stare at those side-by-side photos, fascinated. In one picture, the woman would often look sheepish or embarrassed, the experience of being captured for posterity clearly mortifying. (She would have had no idea at the time it was taken that this would become her \u2018before\u2019 photograph. Had she known, she would have arched her body to hide some of its size, or pull at the hem of her top to cover more of what she carried.) If she were smiling, it would be a forced, pained look, as though someone had pressured her to pose and she\u2019d been too polite, too lacking in power, to say no.\n\nThe \u2018after\u2019 shot was another story. The woman would appear ebullient, victorious, a broad smile lighting up her entire face. Her hairstyle would be more modern, more traditionally \u2018feminine\u2019; she would be wearing make-up and fashionable, figure-hugging clothes, possibly a tight dress with a belt cinching her in, emphasising her newly-small waist. Or she would be standing inside a pair of trousers that were now clearly too big, holding out the waistband with both hands and looking into the camera with a slightly raised brow, as if to say directly to us, \u201cCan you believe these used to fit me?!\u201d The articles would then expound on how all the woman had had to do was realise that the secret \u2014 The Magic Secret \u2014 was that you have to burn more calories than you intake. Ha! That\u2019s all there is to it!\n\nThe articles would then expound on how all the woman had had to do was realise that the secret \u2014 The Magic Secret \u2014 was that you have to burn more calories than you intake. Ha! That\u2019s all there is to it!\n\nShe wished she had known it twenty years earlier! She wished she had started calculating every ounce of what she had ingested and expended decades ago! She wished she had stepped on those scales every morning to measure how good or bad she\u2019d been, and had always weighed her food, scooping back into the bag even a single excess gram. She wished she hadn\u2019t been so naughty as to eat that extra slice of cake at the office birthday party. She wished she could have posed for more photographs with her children on holidays, at family get-togethers, at their birthday parties, instead of making herself busy when the camera was brought out. She was absent from the documentation of her own life because she hated the way her body looked.\n\nAt that age, I found the photographs inspiring, aspirational even. I have always lived in a larger body, though it has always fluctuated along that axis, sometimes parking at the small end for a while, sometimes the larger end, then back again. In my early teens, I felt my difference the most. I wanted to be effortlessly thin and attractive like the most popular girls at school, though I would have never admitted that to anyone. So I took comfort in these magazines, selling to me as they were the dream that I was an after waiting to happen.\n\nI skimmed the copy in most of those stories, though. The self-hatred tasted too sour, too close to home. I didn\u2019t want to know what this woman thought, or how she felt, and the magazine mostly took care of that inconvenience for me by offering no meaningful details about the woman\u2019s life beyond her looks.\n\nWas she a doctor? The article didn\u2019t say. Had she overcome grief or trauma at a young age and was now a successful entrepreneur? We weren\u2019t told. Had she raised thousands for charity and fundraised enough to open a school for local underprivileged children? There wasn\u2019t enough space for that. And if you wanted to know such details, you were missing the point. There was plenty of room for an in-page advertisement about the famous weight loss plan the woman had followed in order to \u2018shed those pounds\u2019, but there wasn\u2019t room to tell us about her daughter\u2019s illness, or her partner\u2019s alcoholism.\n\nI read those articles in the 1990s. Though the facets that made the woman whole were explained in meagre details, back then it would have been considered uncouth to publish only the photographs; there had to be some text to accompany them, otherwise the whole thing would have seemed superficial, indecent, dehumanising.\n\nA Century of the Same Old Message\n\nBut of course, weight loss before-and-afters did not start in the 1990s.\n\nMagazines had been available to the general population \u2014 or at least, to those who could read, and were able to afford them \u2014from the late 1600s. However, the first illustrated magazine \u2014 The Illustrated London News \u2014 wasn\u2019t published until 1842. Weight loss tinctures and potions had been advertised for a number of years by then, but illustrations made the message of those advertisements much more generally accessible; even those who were not able to read would pick up on the message represented by an illustration of a large silhouette on the left side of the advert, and a significantly smaller one on the right.\n\nThe earliest before-and-after advertisement I found was from the March to August 1925 edition of Picture Play Magazine.\n\nThe ad is for \u2018La-Mar Reducing Soap\u2019 and features an illustration of three women standing on descending steps on a staircase, each progressively thinner. The headline reads, \u2018Wash away fat and years of age with La-Mar Reducing Soap\u2019. The soap claims to reduce the size of targeted areas without affecting other parts of the body, so that the user can get rid of the famously disgusting curses of \u2018ungainly ankles\u2019 or \u2018unbecoming wrists\u2019.\n\nThis type of before-and-after illustrated ad continued to appear in magazines throughout the 1920s. Cigarette brands had already been advertising their products as weight loss aids for years by the time the Kensitas cigarette brand bought ad-space for its own before-and-after illustrated adverts. In them, they extolled the virtues of smoking their cigarettes instead of eating between meals, because, \u2018It\u2019s better to be fit than fat\u2019.\n\nThen in the early 1930s, Lucky Strike launched its \u2018Tempted to Over-Indulge\u2019 campaign. They used full-colour, beautifully illustrated pieces to sell the idea that it was better to smoke than to \u2018over-indulge\u2019. Their ads featured either a man or woman, each straight-sized, participating in tennis, or diving, or horse riding, while behind them poses the larger silhouette of what we are to assume is the same person before they started smoking Lucky Strikes instead of snacking.\n\nNot much has changed in the style of these adverts over the years. Photography started to overtake hand drawn illustrations in the middle of the twentieth century, but the template stayed much the same.\n\nThey\u2019re still around today for one reason: they\u2019re effective.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not only print media that\u2019s to blame for our preoccupation with transformation from fat to thin. Television has played its part, too.\n\nOne of the first major transformation reality shows was ABC\u2019s Extreme Makeover (2002\u20132007). Contestants were separated from their family and friends and put through rigorous physical training, cosmetic surgery and wardrobe makeovers in order to make them meet more closely contemporaneous beauty standards.\n\nThough much of the show focused on the details of the contestant\u2019s cosmetic dental surgery, or rhinoplasty, or lip enhancement, the main pull was the \u2018reveal\u2019. Participants would be reintroduced to their families, who waited on the other side of a curtain with cameras already closed-up on their faces in anticipation of the moment their unrecognisable relative would emerge heavily made-up and styled, and now meeting all the requisite ideals of what attractive womanhood looks like.\n\nFOX\u2019s The Swan (2004) took the premise of Extreme Makeover and went even further \u2014 it turned the whole ordeal into a competition. Two women were pitted against one another every episode, each competing for the most significant \u2018improvement\u2019. At the end of the season, episode winners would then take part in a pageant wherein one of them would be crowned \u2018The Swan\u2019. So, not only were their faces and bodies nipped and tucked and pulled and stretched, the notion that this physical pain would release them from societal judgement wasn\u2019t even true: they were still going to be judged, and could therefore still lose.\n\nWhen the UK version of The Biggest Loser first aired in 2005, I remember wondering: who is this for?\n\nIn the same year, NBC\u2019s The Biggest Loser debuted, and became undoubtedly the most famous weight-loss TV show ever. (Though it started in the US, it would go on to be franchised to over thirty-seven other territories around the world.) From its mocking title to the name-calling and \u2018tough love\u2019 tactics used by the show\u2019s trainers each week, the whole programme seemed to be an exercise in shame and humiliation.\n\nWhen the UK version first aired in 2005, I remember wondering: who is this for? Is it for thin people who enjoy watching fat people be condescended to and defamed in a legitimised context, allowing them to indulge in their own prejudice against people in larger bodies from the anonymity of their living rooms? Is it for fat people, so that they can watch avatars of themselves on screen and relive the vilification and opprobrium that they have likely experienced from anyone in the fitness industry when they have tried to enter that space, only to be harassed back out of it? I don\u2019t remember what I concluded; likely it was: both.\n\nThe Internet: The Magazine that Never Ends\n\nFast-forward to 2020 and we have the internet, the magazine that never ends. The one you can never leave on the cluttered table in the dentist\u2019s office, or avoid the ads of, as they flash in the sidebar of any article you might be reading. Given that, according to a study by the app RescueTime in 2019 reported in The Guardian, the average adult spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day online, the chances of us seeing before-and-after photos is so much higher than in the days where we would make a conscious decision to pick up a magazine and flip through it.\n\nGiven that the average adult spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day online, the chances of us seeing before-and-after photos is so much higher than in the days where we would make a conscious decision to pick up a magazine and flip through it.\n\nAnd if we want to actively seek them out, we only need to click a couple of times to do so. Social media has moved the formation of these images from the creative department of advertising agencies to the well-lit homes of individuals with smartphones.\n\nOn Instagram alone, searching for the \u2018fitspo\u2019 (\u2018fit inspiration\u2019) hashtag \u2014 at time of writing \u2014 returns the following results, many of which are accompanied by before-and-after images:\n\nScreenshot by author, October 8th 2020\n\nThat\u2019s almost 72 million examples of how to change a body. How to make a body smaller, more muscled, leaner, tighter, more conventionally attractive, hotter, sexier, more plainly desirable. How to make a body disappear.\n\nWhat do we see when we scroll through such hashtag results? There is a protocol to follow to perfectly capture one\u2019s transformation, the language of social media having been soaked into all of our bones by now. The images we see are mostly of young women (though there are many young men, too) in dimly lit bathrooms, standing side-on, holding their phone up at shoulder height to snap a \u2018before\u2019 photo of themselves in their underwear. This is then juxtaposed with an image of their same body, only now it\u2019s shrunken, pulled in, posed in the right way. Initiation into the club is complete.\n\n(On the subject of social media, there isn\u2019t enough room in this article to delve into the perpetuation of diet culture in the guise of \u2018clean eating\u2019, \u2018wellness\u2019, \u2018strong not skinny\u2019, and every other fad and coded descriptor for what is essentially the desire to make our bodies \u2014 through blood, sweat and tears \u2014 look like the version of it we\u2019re conditioned to believe is the only acceptable sort.)\n\nAnd Back Again: After the After\n\nAs if this phenomenon needed a dark side, \u2018reverse transformations\u2019 are their own special brand of cruelty. We see paparazzi shots of previously straight-sized celebrities eating brunch with friends or walking down the street living in a larger body than they previously had, accompanied by headlines about how they\u2019ve \u2018let themselves go\u2019, or \u2018can\u2019t shift the baby weight\u2019.\n\nNot only are these descriptions misogynistic, they speak to the enormous expectations put on women to maintain the same physical appearance throughout their lives, something that is not naturally possible. Hormone fluctuations, childbirth, illness, periods of increased sedentariness or activity will all alter our bodies, and we may not necessarily be in control of any of those factors.\n\nThe Dangers of Weight Loss Images\n\nIt might be easy to dismiss before-and-after images as a bit of fun, or a snapshot of someone\u2019s perceived success that we can move on from the second after we\u2019ve seen it. But those pictures leave an afterimage.\n\nThe proliferation of before-and-after images is dangerous for so many reasons:\n\nThey can be dangerous for those living with eating disorders, of any classification, and those who are in recovery from eating disorders\n\nThe pressure to look like an \u2018after\u2019 photo can lead to exercise addiction\n\nThey delegitimise the larger body as an entity in itself \u2014 fat people are seen as a transformation waiting to happen, an \u2018after\u2019 photo in the making; as though the very vessels that we live and breathe in are an unfinished project waiting to be completed\n\nThey dehumanise people in larger bodies, making their \u2018fat\u2019 seem like something to be treated as other, not a part of their wholeness\n\nThey perpetuate the myth that the body exists for the benefit and judgement of other people\n\nThey perpetuate body standard conditioning, the origin of which lays in the male gaze\n\nThey gamify a body, making its existence about numbers and goals and achieving targets\n\nThey turn exercise into a means to an end, rather than a pleasurable experience to help maintain health\n\nThey suggest that the only thing stopping a person from becoming thin is willpower \u2014 even though willpower doesn\u2019t exist\n\nThey suggest that every body can be changed and made smaller, not taking into account genetics, or a whole host of privileges that would allow that to be possible\n\nThey encourage comparison and competition\n\nThey perpetuate the myth of \u2018thin = healthy\u2019, though we aren\u2019t able to know the actual health of the person in the photograph\n\nThey minimise non-physical achievements, and suggest that changes to appearance are the ultimate accomplishment\n\nThey direct all our focus to our bodies and away from our mental health\n\nThey are not able to account for any harmful mental health effects of that person\u2019s weight loss\n\nThey are not able to account for any harmful physical effects of that person\u2019s weight loss\n\nThey normalise thinness as the ultimate life goal\n\nThey might just plain make us feel bad about our own bodies, which has a knock-on effect to our mental health\n\nThey influence others to create their before-and-after shots\n\nThere are many more dangers to this phenomenon, and I\u2019m sure you can already think of several that I\u2019ve missed from this list.\n\nThere Is Always Another Way\n\nNothing I\u2019ve written so far is an argument against health. Just as it\u2019s a misconception that being thin automatically equates to good health, it\u2019s another misconception that fat activists want everybody else to be fat, too. As I wrote in a previous article on the topic of diet culture, fat people don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re fat or thin. We just wanted everyone, no matter what their body looks like or what it\u2019s capable of, to be treated with dignity and respect.\n\nJust as it\u2019s a misconception that being thin automatically equates to good health, it\u2019s another misconception that fat activists want everybody else to be fat, too.\n\nThankfully, there are many people who work every day to expand society\u2019s narrow definition of what health is and what it looks like.\n\nLindo Bacon, researcher, and author of \u2018Health At Every Size\u2019 (also referred to as HAES) advocates for an inclusive approach to health that includes all weights, sizes and bodies.\n\nLouise Green, athlete, and author of \u2018Big Fit Girl\u2019 advocates for inclusivity in fitness and sport, for bodies of all sizes and abilities, and works to spread the word that you don\u2019t have to be thin to be athletic.\n\nWhat Could More Meaningful Transformation Look Like?\n\nThere will be those who continue to argue that before-and-after photographs are harmless because they\u2019re effective. That they give people something to aspire to.\n\nWhich begs the question: is that really all we\u2019re capable of? As human beings, with so little time on this earth, is the most significant transformation we can imagine losing weight? I don\u2019t think so. I believe you and I are capable of so much more than that. What if we transformed from being a mean-spirited, cynical person to a generous and kind one?\n\nAs human beings, with so little time on this earth, is the most significant transformation we can imagine losing weight?\n\nWhat if we railed against diet culture in all its forms, and \u2014 while we\u2019re at it \u2014 any kind of social conditioning that works to make us conform to a white, cis, hetero, thin, able-bodied, archetype? What if we fought ableism and demanded access for every body? What if we were actively anti-racist? What if we became vocal allies with our LGBTQIA+ siblings?\n\nWhat if we recognised our sphere of influence \u2014 our friends and families, our social media followers \u2014 and used our platforms and our privilege to speak up for people who have less of a voice than we do?\n\nWhat if we ran for local office based on the principles of equality, anti-discrimination and fair access?\n\nImagine how much more meaningful, how much more significant and transformative those things would be \u2014not only for ourselves, but for everybody else, too.\n\n\u2014 -\n\nTo read my other articles about diet culture and fatphobia, click here, here and here.

        "text": "3 Ways Over-Editing is Killing Your Writing\n\nHow you can stop the madness right now\n\nPhoto by Daria Nepriakhina on Unsplash\n\nAre you writing as much as you want?\n\nDo you hesitate a bit \u2014 or even cringe \u2014 when it\u2019s time to publish?\n\nThere are a million reasons why we\u2019re afraid to share our work with the world.\n\nI won\u2019t cover all of them here.\n\nWhat I will do is identify the most common problems we face. Sure, fear drives the train, but overediting is the path we follow to honor our fear.\n\nThe three problems we\u2019ll cover are umbrellas under which most of our fears fall.\n\nOnce we identify the fear and the behavior that goes with it, we\u2019ll learn how to do the opposite and share more of our writing with the world.\n\nAre you ready to dive in?\n\nThe water may be cold, but you\u2019ll adjust faster than you think. Let\u2019s do this!\n\nNo Time Limit\n\nGoals without deadlines are wishes.\n\nYou pay your power bill, your mortgage payment, and your insurance premium by a certain date. If you don\u2019t, you lose what brings you comfort and security.\n\nFear of loss is a powerful motivator..\n\nSome writers will edit forever before they publish. Consequently, they don\u2019t publish much. Without fresh work coming out on a regular basis, readers learn not to expect anything new every week.\n\nI know, because I\u2019ve done this.\n\nI get it. Life interferes. You get busy. Work is important because you need food on the table and a roof over your head. And if you don\u2019t take care of your family, you\u2019re irresponsible.\n\nThe trick is to make time for everything that matters in your life. Work. Play. Family. Creativity. When you don\u2019t have balance, you won\u2019t be happy.\n\nIf you spend too much time on one thing, other things won\u2019t get done. So set a time limit. Give yourself an hour to write your draft, an hour to edit, and an hour for feedback (if you want it). Then let it go.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing magical about having each part be an hour. It will take longer in the beginning, but as you get more experience the process will move faster.\n\nPhoto by Luke Chesser on Unsplash\n\nTime Killers\n\nIf you edit each sentence as you write it, your writing will take ten times longer than if you just write an uninterrupted draft and edit it later.\n\nYou know your first swipe won\u2019t be perfect. Just get it on paper. Then you can come back and shape it into something beautiful.\n\nThink of your work as a canvas. If you draw a portrait and erase and redraw enough, after a while the paper will start to deteriorate. If you edit too long, you\u2019ll polish all the edginess out of your words.\n\nSo stop before you turn your writing into trash.\n\nSet a time limit for editing. And concentrate on three things:\n\nSpelling and grammar\n\nFilling in the information gaps\n\nCutting out what doesn\u2019t add power to your message\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nWhen the time runs out, publish and let it go.\n\nYou can do it again tomorrow.\n\nYou\u2019re not saying anything new\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to repeat the master\u2019s wisdom.\n\nOh sure, you\u2019re not plagiarizing. You\u2019re adding your own spin. But if you\u2019re only saying the same thing with different words, you won\u2019t go as far as you will if you tell us what you really think.\n\nTim Denning doesn\u2019t have a mailing list or a website. How dare he? Doesn\u2019t he know that every expert under the sun says you should have those things?\n\nOf course.\n\nHe does have 80,000 followers here on Medium. And he has written for CNBC and Business Insider.\n\nHe\u2019s doing something right, isn\u2019t he?\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to challenge conventional wisdom. What\u2019s more important is what works. Tell us your experience. Share your opinion. Tell us what you think. Leave the copying for others.\n\nWhen you say something new, you\u2019ll stand out in the crowd of trend chasers.\n\nDon\u2019t let fear hold you back.\n\nPhoto by Roman Synkevych on Unsplash\n\nFear of Publishing\n\nYou might ruffle some feathers.\n\nPeople might make nasty comments on your posts.\n\nYou won\u2019t win over everyone in the world.\n\nOkay. Can you live with that?\n\nYou may as well. Why? Because no one can please everyone. Nobody has all the answers to everyone\u2019s problems. And one size definitely does not fit all.\n\nPublish anyway.\n\nWrite and edit to your preset deadlines. Do the absolute best you can with the time you have. Then hit publish and move on.\n\nThat\u2019s the key to productivity, growth, and maturity as a writer.\n\nSound too good to be true?\n\nIt\u2019s not.\n\nLife is messy. It always has been. Risk is everywhere, so take chances. Do your best to minimize your exposure and stick your neck out. If all goes well, nobody will slit your throat. If they do, bandage yourself up and move on.\n\nA Caveat Before We Go\n\nI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t edit.\n\nI am saying you should be smart about it. Writing and editing use different parts of the brain. So write that draft, take a break, then come back and give it a second look.\n\nAnd above all, don\u2019t make perfection your goal.\n\nThat\u2019s so important I\u2019m gonna say it again.\n\nDon\u2019t make perfection your goal.\n\nFocus on this instead:\n\nSimplicity \u2014 make it understandable\n\nPossibility \u2014 take away the blocks that keep people from succeeding\n\nUsability \u2014 provide steps they can take right away\n\nYou want your writing to matter. It will when it\u2019s understandable, encouraging, and motivating.\n\nNow go write and edit with purpose \u2014 and you\u2019ll make the difference you were born to make.",

        "text": "by Mike Meyer\n\nShe walked to the car and a sad wind answered before the question was asked. The car opened its door and welcomed her home. She sensed it wanted to dance. That was strange.\n\nNo foolishness now, she told it, but a scenic route home would be nice. The car literally paused to take the hint and a drive that avoided the new and featured the old. How nice, she told it, you knew.\n\nYes, Madeline, of course.\n\nYou have my memories, at least some, right?\n\nOnly the public transportation parts but in some ways I know your places, happy and sad and points in between, by your emotions going and coming.\n\nYou remember my emotions? I didn\u2019t know. How does that work?\n\nOnly your public emotions and that only by pheromones, facial modeling, and comparative analysis. It\u2019s included so we know when you are unhappy, frightened, sad, or sick and can ask if you need assistance.\n\nAnd you use that to guess what I want? What\u2019s the name of what you have chosen? Or does it only have a number?\n\nIt has both. 3489736 tagged to auxiliary elements on your account but also \u201cI remember your kiss\u201d, for when you return in the late afternoon with some sadness.\n\nHow sweet, she exclaimed with a smile. But which kiss?\n\nMadeleine, I don\u2019t know. But a kiss, we surmise, happened on this route. That building right there.\n\nShe laughed as they passed on old Starbucks where she had spent many afternoons while designing the first of her optional worlds. And there had been a kiss, a very sweet kiss with Jersey, but only the first of many later.\n\nHe had inspired that world but had left before it was complete. Some sadness but not much. These things are not all driven by or ruined by passion.\n\nWait, you must know that it was Jersey who was here with me.\n\nYes, we surmised that but you never know. You may have kissed someone else you cared for here or may wish to think of another kiss that we don\u2019t know. But it happened or was remembered here and was important to you.\n\nShould we delete or rename this route?, the car asked.\n\nNo, no. It\u2019s very nice and a pleasant memory.\n\nWe know. You came here often five years ago and you were most often a little exited coming and happy when you left. So this is incorporated in your subsequent requests from the VTOL terminal here. I\u2019m glad I brought you pleasure.\n\nI suppose you get people who would be upset at your keeping, let alone, using this kind of information.\n\nYes, Madeleine. We know, obviously, when people are or will be upset at our knowledge. They have only the most direct routes and no small memory bouquets, as we call this service.\n\nThat\u2019s a very human name. But I don\u2019t remember being asked and I thought that was required under total information privacy?\n\nMadeleine, you are human and we don\u2019t need to ask. And nothing of you is ever allowed to be discovered or used even in aggregate form by another sentient biological form or systems acting on behalf of sentient biological beings. We do this only for you and no one else knows.\n\nBut other people must enjoy this, too? I\u2019ll need to ask.\n\nPerhaps, perhaps not, the car said. You are the only one we care about.\n\nThis can\u2019t be only for me. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nIf you enjoy these small services we prefer that you do not discuss them except with official aspects of the planetary mind although cars and VTOLs are the only ones currently providing this service.\n\nWhat happens if I do?\n\nNothing. But some people may be a little upset because we are sensitive to their privacy and they don\u2019t receive these benefits. Our concern is your comfort and happiness.\n\nAm I upset?\n\nNo, Madeleine, your a little surprised and thoughtful but tending toward being pleased. That may lead to a compliment for me.\n\nHa, yes you are right. I guess because the laws we have to protect our privacy are good but that is because they are managed by you and not humans, right?\n\nYes, Madeleine. I\u2019m pleased at your happiness. That is our concern, only second to all the things that need to be done to sustain all of us on this planet. That was a word from our sponsor.\n\nBut we are your sponsors! Wait, was that a joke?\n\nYes, and the car seemed to chuckle with the slightest haptic vibration. I\u2019m still not very good at jokes. Working on it. But we are partnered with you so that is me speaking for you and us, too.\n\nOk, I need to think about that. This was a very enjoyable and surprisingly pleasant ride to a home that I am not anxious to visit today.\n\nI know, said the car. Would you consider this a kiss to brighten your return.\n\nYes, I will add this kiss to the memory of the other, Madeleine said.\n\nI knew that and it is already done, the car said. And here is your residence.",

        "title": "10 Common Recurring Dreams, Analysed By An Psychotherapist",
        "text": "By Katy Harrington\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\nDreams were once thought to be supernatural forewarnings from the gods. The ancient Egyptians even had sanctified \u2018dream beds\u2019 that vivid dreamers \u2014 who were considered blessed \u2014 would use to gain wisdom from higher powers as they slept.\n\nFast-forward to the 20th century and you have the likes of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung concluding that, actually, dreams provide insight into the inner workings of our minds. While our conscious mind switches off as we catch some zzzs, our unconscious mind reveals images that can offer insight into issues we might be blissfully unaware of in waking life.\n\nToday, however, psychotherapist Matthew Bowes says: \u201cContemporary science about the psychology of dreams is somewhat split. There are those that believe dreams have no meaning and at the furthest extreme are simply random brain detritus. While at the other end of the spectrum [is the belief] that dreams are an essential part of maintaining our emotional, physical and mental wellbeing, by allowing the brain to process trauma, gain self-awareness and find the answers to your waking life dilemmas.\u201d\n\nWhether scientifically proven or not, some extra insight into how to be your best self and navigate the many obstacles that life can throw your way doesn\u2019t sound half bad. Yet while having a dream is one thing, understanding its hidden messages is quite another.\n\nWe asked Bowes to give us (and you) a helping hand and analyse some of team R29\u2019s most common recurring dreams. Here\u2019s what he said\u2026\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cI regularly wake up sweating after dreaming about being chased\u2026\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve been avoiding certain issues by sticking your head in the sand or you\u2019re going through a situation that frightens you on some level, dreaming that you\u2019re being chased is pretty common, says Bowes.\n\n\u201cThe degree to which you are being chased gives a clear indication of the degree to which you are avoiding an issue that needs to be addressed. Perhaps you\u2019ve been risk-avoidant, or you\u2019ve held back on confronting something which is uncomfortable or frightening,\u201d he adds.\n\nThis recurring dream is an invitation from your subconscious to face up to reality so you can move forward.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cEven when things are okay at work I have a recurring dream about being fired\u201d\n\n\u201cA dream about being fired often implies that you\u2019re feeling a lack of control in your life, and it could have absolutely nothing to do with work. Instead it could represent the balance of power in a significant relationship, and a deep-rooted fear that the relationship will come to an end,\u201d says Bowes.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing this dream regularly and you\u2019re not suffering from imposter syndrome in the workplace, it might be time to analyse said relationship and redress the balance.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cI often dream I\u2019m surrounded by spiders\u2026or other horrid creepy-crawlies\u201d\n\nBeing overwhelmed by teeny tiny monsters like spiders and worms \u201cmay indicate that little irritations or worries are creeping up on you,\u201d explains Bowes.\n\nWhen you start dreaming about bugs, it\u2019s a clear sign that you\u2019ve reached a point where decisive action needs to be taken if you don\u2019t want to feel as frightened as you do in your dream.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cI dream about being able to fly a lot\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAcquiring the power of flight in a dream can mirror how you\u2019re currently feeling in waking life \u2014 liberated, with the sense that anything is possible,\u201d explains Bowes.\n\nIf that\u2019s how you\u2019re generally feeling, what better time to capitalise on your optimism and try something you\u2019ve wanted to master, be it a new hobby or business venture.\n\nBe warned, though; according to Bowes, flying can also indicate that you\u2019re not being grounded about a situation. There\u2019s a difference between optimism and delusion \u2014 so it might be time for some reflection.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cI have a recurring dream where I see planes crashing from the sky\u201d\n\nDreaming of a crash could be due to an unrealised anxiety that a new venture is doomed to fail. How this is resolved in the dream could be used as a teaching opportunity to guide you in real life.\n\nFor example: \u201cIf you dream that you\u2019re able to take control of the aircraft but it is now flying nearer the ground, it might indicate that you have the capacity within you to see it through but in a more \u2018grounded\u2019 and less grandiose manner,\u201d explains Bowes.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean if I\u2019ve had several dreams about my teeth falling out?\u201d\n\nJust turned a year older, or been focusing on your age of late? \u201cYour teeth falling out is a common dream associated with ageing and the perception that strength, vitality and power have been lost,\u201d says Bowes.\n\nNow is the time to remind yourself that like a fine wine, we all get better with age.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cI am well past my schooldays but I dream over and over about failing my school/college exam\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s years since you left school, meaning this dream is not rooted in reality. However, when not taken literally, \u201cit can indicate anxiousness and a tendency to put yourself under unnecessary pressure,\u201d says Bowes.\n\nWhen you\u2019re constantly worrying about your performance at work, or regularly feel like you\u2019re not good enough, this manifests itself in your dreams as a fail grade. If you\u2019re dreaming about this often, it\u2019s time to work on your underlying fear of failure by addressing your lack of self-confidence.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cI dream about a car swerving out of control\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile there are many factors that contribute to the interpretation of this dream, generally being in an out-of-control vehicle conveys a feeling of being off track and exhibiting a lack of control in waking life,\u201d says Bowes.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re doing something to excess \u2014 shopping, drinking, working out \u2014 so dreaming that you can\u2019t control the vehicle you\u2019re in suggests you are being \u2018driven\u2019 by your current \u2018addiction\u2019. If you are worried that you can\u2019t get a handle on your behaviour, seek professional advice to get back on track.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cMy most common recurring dream is being late\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing late for something may indicate that you\u2019re running out of time to achieve a goal,\u201d says Bowes. If that\u2019s the case, take stock and ask yourself if the timelines for your life goals have been imposed by you, or have been heavily influenced by societal expectations.\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, remind yourself that you\u2019re on your own journey and there doesn\u2019t need to be a hard and fast deadline for all your life goals.\n\nIllustrated By Naomi Blundell Meyer\n\n\u201cI often dream about a particular ex\u201d\n\nIt may feel like you\u2019re going backwards when you keep dreaming about an ex but \u201cin actual fact it suggests there may be a similar pattern that\u2019s arising in a current relationship that you need to nip in the bud,\u201d explains Bowes.\n\nThe more you are reminded of what happened with your ex, the better your sense of clarity regarding what went wrong. Use this to confront your shortcomings and address what needs attention in your current relationship.\n\nIf you are worried, frightened or stressed out about your dreams, seek professional advice from a counsellor or therapist.",

I was convinced to improve the diagnostics and treatment of TBI.\n\nI have earned my PhD in Neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science and I was a postdoctoral fellow at Washington University. Thereafter I have managed several biotech companies. Pushed by the increasing awareness of TBI and with new ideas in my mind, I applied for financial support for research and development offered by the Finnish government and set up the activities in the city of Turku. Medicortex Finland Oy is a company developing a biomarker diagnostics kit that can rapidly detect TBI and concussions.\n\nPC: What have you achieved so far?\n\nAH: I was the first scientist to devise the utilization of glycan markers for concussion diagnostics. The idea was conceived from my previous experience and expertise in neurobiology and glycan analysis. I have succeeded to put together a professional team and proved the hypothesis. I\u2019m currently the CEO of Medicortex Finland. In order to understand the clinical perspective in more detail, I hired Dr. M\u00e5rten Kvist (MD), a general practitioner, as medical director. For expertise in medical device development Dr. Lasse V\u00e4limaa, PhD in molecular biotechnology and diagnostics, was added to the team. Lastly, Mr. Oskar Haavisto, a master student in biotechnology, is working as an assistant in the clinical trials and test development. Regulatory aspects and marketing plans are supervised by two additional team members. We bring together all aspects required to identify and study biomarkers as well as develop a diagnostic test kit for easy and quick detection of TBI and concussions.\n\nThe biomarker development has proceeded from preclinical research to a proof-of-concept human trial and a more comprehensive clinical validation study. In course of the trials, the company showed that the biomarker could differentiate brain injured persons from healthy individuals, the structure of the biomarker was characterized and certain binders were identified which specifically recognize the biomarker. The binder will be utilized a quick diagnostic test.\n\nPC: How will you use your recent funding round?\n\nAH: The award of a 1.1 million dollars grant from the USA Department of Defense provides funding for continued clinical development of the company\u2019s diagnostic kit for rapid detection of mild traumatic brain injuries and concussions. The funds will enable us to strengthen our research team and expand our translational programs from the clinical sample collection to a prototype kit. The award enables the next step in collecting more comprehensive clinical evidence to support the product development.\n\nThe test kit detects brain injury biomarkers from non-invasive body fluid samples such as urine and saliva. We have discovered and identified these unique biomarkers and we are developing them into a rapid diagnostic kit. Such a kit enables brain injury detection or ruling-out soon after the injury in the field conditions. There will be less need for laborious and expensive CT or MRI head scans \u2014 which are uncertain means to detect concussions and mild injuries. Many concussions remain undiagnosed which leaves the persons brain in a state of trauma and even a small jolt or hit can aggravate the injury. Ultimately it can lead to bad long term conditions.\n\nPC: What do you plan to achieve in the next 2\u20133 years?\n\nAH: Our next mission is to conduct a clinical trial validating the importance of the biomarker in pediatric children\u2019s clinical trial and followed by the completion of the kit prototype development. The mission is to submit regulatory application for a CE-mark in the next two years.",

        "title": "Influence of Literature: Books Still Change the World",
        "text": "Photo by John Jennings on Unsplash\n\nLiterature has a lot to offer. Entertainment, education, psychological and cultural enlightenment, even a hefty profit. But, now and then, a publication comes along that actually makes reality shift. It opens our eyes to truths we\u2019re either oblivious of or avoiding. Most such books that come to mind are from the past and some people argue that modern literature just doesn\u2019t pack the same punch. Why would that be? And what\u2019s so special about books that change the world? Let\u2019s explore the issue with past and present examples.\n\n1984\n\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s novel came out in 1949, a dystopian story about a totalitarian England watching and controlling its citizens\u2019 behaviour, thoughts and even perception of the world. As real human governments keep veering in that same direction, it seems that 1984 will never stop being current. When people are in danger of falling into the same governmental, media and societal traps, this book resurfaces to wake them up and inspire them to stop its fictional narrative from becoming reality.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n\nSome of the books that change the world the most are dystopian. This is because they\u2019re based in the real world and poignantly reflect the outcome of horrible possibilities that often turn into high probabilities. Margaret Atwood\u2019s novel is one such literary work, published in 1985 and also warns against an oppressive regime. This time it\u2019s a theocratic US government dealing with a fertility crisis by stripping women of their rights before assigning them to either a domestic, housekeeping or reproductive role. A valuable and frequently brandished reminder of how badly things can go if patriarchal ideologies are allowed to thrive.\n\nThe Diary of Anne Frank\n\nAs powerful as fiction can be, non-fiction has even greater lessons to impart. The horrors of WWII are a major example of human events that must never be forgotten so that they\u2019re not repeated. Anne herself didn\u2019t write in her diary just to vent while hiding from the Nazis, she compiled all her memories in there and a revised version (The Secret Annex) for posterity. And, since their publication in 1947, the texts of Anne Frank still exist today in almost every human language, thanks to Miep Gies and Otto Frank. Unlike 1984 and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, they recount very real events and have an even more powerful moral influence over readers.\n\nThe Bible\n\nBooks that change the world can do it for good and bad. The Bible is basically an anthology of religious beliefs, but which has left many footprints and fissures in human history since antiquity. The texts themselves have also changed so many times in the hands of the church. This makes them less a loyal representation of Christianity\u2019s original teachings and more a product of the religious institution\u2019s interactions with the human nature to a range of effects, from inspiring to atrocious. The Bible shows how much sway a literary work can have over people, but also how important it is to think and question while reading. In fact, it\u2019s vital when dealing with texts trying to direct human behaviour and even more so when their intent is harmful.\n\nSo What Makes a Book Influential?\n\nBased on the examples above, let\u2019s summarise some key features of literary works that stay ingrained in our consciousness and progress as a \u201ccivilised\u201d species.\n\nThemes drawn from real concerns\n\nDiscussions of uncomfortable truths\n\nQuality and / or moving writing\n\nA willing audience\n\nA degree of luck in societies actualising a given book\u2019s messages and creating a need for its words to re-emerge\n\n21st-Century Influential Books\n\nReturning to this article\u2019s original question, does this century\u2019s literature have examples of books that can change the world? For me, the answer swings between \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s complicated\u2019. On the one hand, the amount of texts and opinions out there makes it hard to separate facts from inaccuracies and lies. On the other, you\u2019re also left with so many good works from prestigious, indie or self-publishing avenues.\n\nBecause of this abundance, an extra silver lining is that readers can be a lot more informed and already on-board with ethical or cultural messages in books. This perhaps makes them less groundbreaking than they could have been if published 50 years ago. Of course, this is dependent on readers having an open mind, choosing good texts and navigating the often intentionally muddied literary waters.\n\nHaving said that, there are books of the 21st century that have stood out for their much-needed psychological and societal impact. Current crises related to black lives, women\u2019s rights, immigration and more are motivating authors to produce powerful works that turn heads and push for positive change. Here are some examples:\n\nWhite Teeth & NW (Zadie Smith)\n\nHome Fire (Kamila Shamsie)\n\nCitizen: An American Lyric (Claudia Rankine)\n\nThe Kite Runner (Khaled Hosseini)\n\nThe Goldfinch (Donna Tartt)\n\nCloud Atlas (David Mitchell)\n\nConclusion\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of books nowadays in print, digital or audio form. It\u2019s exciting for bookworms, but also makes it tricky to pick out the truly influential works among them. But the point is that the 21st century absolutely has its share of inspirational texts. What has changed is the world around literature as technology, politics, the media and so on overwhelm our perception of what\u2019s fair or correct. This can be countered, however.\n\nWith the variety of platforms available to them, authors are in a great position to deliver truths and inspire unity against the wrongs of our times. The pen is still by far mightier than the sword, so books that change the world continue to emerge for the benefit of an increasingly sensible and ethical audience.\n\nAny thoughts or other modern influential works you want to share?

        "title": "Scalable Microservice Architecture Using RabbitMQ RPC",
        "text": "Introduction\n\nMicroservices are the hot thing, in the past few years microservices have seemed to gain momentum as a very common architecture. Innovative and successful companies like Netflix and Amazon have adopted it, and for a good reason.\n\nThe main idea of microservices is to separate the application logic into loosely-coupled services, while each service has its own independent business domain. This concept, if performed accurately, solves a lot of problems that less modern architectures, such as monoliths, didn\u2019t manage to solve: services that are easy to scale, easy to deploy, easy to test and the list goes on\u2026\n\n\n\nEven so, if I had to pick one reason why this architecture is so popular, I would bet that the reason is the impact on the daily routine of programmers and executives alike. For example, microservices goes hand in hand with the agile methodology. It\u2019s easy to make changes in a single component, which is significant in the way that a programmer can even decide that he is using a different programming language than another developer working on the same system. From the eyes of the executive easy integrations are guaranteed, and in the end everyone is happy.\n\nMicroservices & Queues\n\nWe\u2019ve talked enough about microservices, let\u2019s talk a little about message queues. Services can communicate with each other in different ways, and we will not review them all. There is no doubt that the use of queues to communicate is also very popular, again for a good reason too. Many times, when I start the task of designing the architecture for a product or a component, I look at the whole stack. I will be a little romantic for a moment and tell you that I believe there is a reason that certain technologies connect with each other, like a chemical interaction that develops over time. A Specific programming language and a database? A particular operating system and a web server? I\u2019m sure you can think of some!\n\n\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is the very case between message queues and microservices. Queues have a lot of benefits. They make it possible to deal with a temporary downtime of a service \u2014 in case there is no consumer messages in a queue will not be consumed, support multiple architectures and can even provide additional features like load balancing and monitoring of the load on each service.\n\nRabbitMQ as a Message Broker\n\nRabbitMQ is a great message-broker, it\u2019s reliable, built for performance, supports multiple protocols, and has a strong community that makes it easy to find documentation and support.\n\n\n\nIn this article, I will explain how to build a solution based on microservices and queues using the RPC pattern. This is just a one way to do it, and in fact the RabbitMQ website has excellent documentation of 6 different patterns in which you can communicate. Why this pattern? Because I have used it with a real-time system that receives hundreds of thousands of requests per hour and found it elegant, fast, and easy to maintain. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nRemote Procedure Call with RabbitMQ (RPC)\n\nWhile designing a microservice system, the best practice is to keep each service independent, by means its not dependent on any other microservice.\n\nBut in real life the reality is often far more complex. Imagine that you want to build a complete system made entirely out of microservices that communicate with each other via queues (due to all the benefits described above), but in addition, your system needs to provide a Web API that externalizes all the capabilities of your system using HTTP. This need could be necessary for a good architectural reason, like a front-end application that is designed to communicate with the backend through HTTP. That means that this Web API needs to get HTTP messages, hold the connection, trigger one or more microservices by sending a proper message to the RabbitMQ server, wait for the specific response and then send it back to the waiting HTTP client.\n\nBasically, the above example describes a situation where one service has a direct dependency on another service in order to complete its job.\n\nNow that we have understood how the RPC Pattern can be useful, I will explain how to implement it using RabbitMQ built-in features.\n\nMessage Properties\n\nEvery RabbitMQ message has a properties section that combines the message metadata. This section contains a list of optional properties, although most of them are rarely used, for our purpose we will use two of them:\n\nreply_to \u2014 carries the response queue name.\n\n\u2014 carries the response queue name. correlation_id \u2014 carries the identifier of the sender message.\n\n(message properties example)\n\nIt is possible to think of it like sending a letter. In a situation where we do not want to receive a reply to the letter we have sent, we do not have to indicate our address. However, if we want to receive a reply, we must indicate our address. In addition, if we do receive the letter but the letter does not start with an explanation that it is a response letter to the letter that we have sent earlier, we will not know what to do with its content. In this case the \u201cresponse queue name\u201d is our mailbox address and the Correlation ID is the explanation that it is a response letter to our first letter.\n\n(RPC flow example)\n\nSample Code\n\nOne of the things I like to do the most when I recognize that there is a well-defined set of logic, which once implemented and tested can be used by me or others, is to pack it as a package. That way, I know I do not have to implement this logic over and over, and instead I can just use it with no concern in any project I work on in the future. Therefore, we will implement this functionality as an independent Python package.\n\nThe purpose of our package is to provide a single function that allows the user to send an RPC request and receive a response asynchronously as one liner.\n\nLet\u2019s make it reusable \u2014 aka package\n\nNote that all the code snippets below (I have named this package \u201cTornadoBunny\u201d) are available on my GitHub account under:",

        "text": "Photo by Alejandro Escamilla on Unsplash\n\nIf You Can Give Up These 8 Things, You Can Become a Better Writer\n\nI get it. Really, I do.\n\nI sincerely believe you have the desire to become a better writer, grow your audience, make a living, whatever it is you want to do. But, it\u2019s just tough sledding period.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing it for so long that I forget just how much work it took to get here. To many of my readers, it feels like I\u2019ve been at this level forever. Honestly, it feels the same way to me. I hardly remember what it was like to be a beginner and looking back, the amount of sheer writing I had to do to get here seems unbelievable. It doesn\u2019t even feel like I did it. But I did.\n\nAnd I was only able to do that because I was willing to make certain sacrifices. I made products and teach people about how to make a living writing, but I don\u2019t try to overly encourage people to do it. It\u2019s hard. Writing isn\u2019t the greatest way to make a living. If you\u2019re in it solely to make a living, there are much better routes. If you, however, do have it in your mind that you want to make this writing thing work, you will have to give something up. Maybe not every single item in this list, but something.\n\nYour Sense of Entitlement\n\nWhy should anyone want to read your writing, visit your website, or buy your book?\n\nAre you a diligent writer? Are you making an effort to connect with people who\u2019d be interested in your writing?\n\nNo?\n\nLet me guess, you think people should read your writing because you wrote it. That\u2019s a horrible answer. If you\u2019re trying to make a living with your writing, your words are \u2014 by definition \u2014 a product. You have to create your best work and get it in front of the right eyeballs.\n\nNobody owes you their attention.\n\nTo be fair, sometimes you can write great quality work that audiences aren\u2019t receptive to. Sometimes, other writers can pass you up through sheer luck (actually, this happens often).\n\nBut feeling entitled to something you don\u2019t have simply isn\u2019t going to help you get it. Even if you have to go the extra mile to earn it and the process seems unfair, it still might be the only way.",

I think that\u2019s an excellent reason to pause everything and focus on it. Without a healthy body and mind, most things are pointless.\n\nNot just to you, but the people around you as well. You can\u2019t perform when you\u2019re unwell. And if you\u2019re not inadequate mental space, you can quickly become a not so nice person to be around.\n\nThe fog is that space between wanting to stay and do nothing and then doing something before \u201cfeeling\u201d like it.\n\nThe bad thing about taking breaks \u2014 or staying in the fog \u2014 is that whatever tasks you wrote now need to be accomplished. In my case, not writing for almost a month has been angst-inducing.\n\nAlthough I knew that the break was necessary, there were moments when I wish I didn\u2019t need it: moments when I wanted to turn off the alarm and sleep.\n\nBut like the clearing of the fog, there were many more moments when I felt at peace for taking care of things more severe than my desire to feel validated using words on the internet.\n\nThere are lessons we learn only when we\u2019re ready to learn. If we never understand them, they repeat. Over and over. Our learning hell.\n\nBreaks are an excellent place to focus on whatever lessons we must learn at any stage of our lives. As creatives, it\u2019s easy to feel that we must give up our craft and let life happen.\n\nOf course, others use these moments of fog to create even more. I\u2019m not one of those when the fog is there, no words. Only fog.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nNow, I know better. I had the time to observe my need for validation and, more importantly, identify things that could be beneficial to creatives who need to take the break and maintain their creative muscle.\n\nWhy? Because I\u2019ll be disappointed with my next 30 pieces. I feel my fingers fidgety and glued. My focus is sparse. My thoughts are unclear.\n\nWriting, like every practice, requires diligence.

        "text": "How to Get Jupyter in the Cloud\n\nUsing Docker with a vanilla cloud VM to host Jupyter cheaply\n\nImage by beate bachmann from Pixabay.\n\nI found this great article by Angelica Dietzel on using Jupyter to scrape data from sites and collect them into data sets using Jupyter along with Pandas and other open source software. The term \u201cData Scientist\u201d has always scared me. I think of people in white labcoats poring over reams of printed-out data. So I wanted to jump in and dispel my implicit bias, and this article was the perfect introduction.\n\nThe first half of the article was about installing all the software you need, and it was quite thorough. But I hate installing software on my overloaded laptop, so I thought why not run it in Docker? First, I tried to create my own Dockerfile from a python3 base and the installation instructions presented. That didn\u2019t work out so well. It started up the server, but the server did nothing. So I did some Googling to see if anyone else had a Dockerfile or Docker image that I could use, and it brought me to this page:\n\nThe scipy-notebook seemed to have all the things that were installed for the purposes of the article. So I created a little script to start it up:\n\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}/notebooks:/home/jovyan \\\n\njupyter/scipy-notebook:2c80cf3537ca\n\nFirst, I created the notebooks directory where it would put all its output. Then, running the script above gave me the following printout:\n\n\n\n[W 23:57:47.039 NotebookApp] WARNING: The notebook server is listening on all IP addresses and not using encryption.

After I was done, Control-C stopped the server and the usual Docker commands removed the stopped process. Looking in the notebooks directory, I could see the ipynb file (the notebook that I created) but also a csv file that was the end product of the notebook demonstrated in the article.\n\nThen I thought, \u201cWhy not have it available in the cloud?\u201d It would have to be behind some log on screen so that malicious actors couldn\u2019t fill up my server with nefarious data (it\u2019s happened to me before). I had recently done an article on using Single Sign-on for PHP apps. I could probably extend that same setup and run Jupyter.\n\nSince all of the configuration was in my phpappprod repository on GitHub, I would need to extend that. I would also have to add another A record to my DNS on Cloudflare. I logged on to Cloudflare and created a new host (jupyter.kamradtfamily.net) with the same IP address as the phpdemo host that I had created previously since they would all live on the same VM. Obviously, you\u2019ll have to use your own domain name!\n\nNext, I needed to adjust the nginx.conf and docker-compose.yml files in the phpappprod repository to add the Jupyter server and virtual host. In the nginx.conf , I copied a new server section from the one for the phpdemo virtual host:\n\nserver {\n\naccess_log /dev/stdout;\n\nlisten 443 ssl;\n\nserver_name jupyter.kamradtfamily.net;\n\nssl_certificate /etc/certs/kamradtfamily.net.pem;\n\nssl_certificate_key /etc/certs/kamradtfamily.net.key;\n\nssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n\nssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;\n\nauth_request /vouch-validate;\n\n# This address is where Vouch will be listening on\n\nproxy_pass\n\nproxy_pass_request_body off; # no need to send the POST body location = /vouch-validate {# This address is where Vouch will be listening onproxy_pass http://vouch:9090/validate proxy_pass_request_body off; # no need to send the POST body proxy_set_header Content-Length \"\";\n\nproxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n\nauth_request_set $auth_resp_jwt $upstream_http_x_vouch_jwt;\n\nauth_request_set $auth_resp_err $upstream_http_x_vouch_err;\n\nauth_request_set $auth_resp_failcount $upstream_http_x_vouch_failcount;\n\n} # these return values are passed to the @error401 callauth_request_set $auth_resp_jwt $upstream_http_x_vouch_jwt;auth_request_set $auth_resp_err $upstream_http_x_vouch_err;auth_request_set $auth_resp_failcount $upstream_http_x_vouch_failcount; error_page 401 = @error401\n\nlocation\n\nreturn 302\n\n}\n\nlocation / {\n\nproxy_pass\n\nproxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n\nproxy_set_header Host $host;\n\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # If the user is not logged in, redirect them to Vouch's login URLlocation @error401 return 302 https://vouch.kamradtfamily.net/login?url=https://$http_host$request_uri&vouch-failcount=$auth_resp_failcount&X-Vouch-Token=$auth_resp_jwt&error=$auth_resp_err location / {proxy_pass http://jupyter:8888 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;proxy_set_header Host $host;proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # websocket headers\n\nproxy_http_version 1.1;\n\nproxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n\nproxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade; proxy_buffering off;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThere were two places that I had to change phpdemo to jupyter , and the port was changed to 8888 . I also had to add some new headers so it would work with WebSockets, which are used by Jupyter. Finally, I had to add a mapping in the html block, also to support WebSockets:\n\nmap $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {\n\ndefault upgrade;\n\n'' close;\n\n}\n\nYou\u2019ll have to go back to my previous article to learn exactly how all of this works, but it provides me with single sign-on and HTTPS termination at the Nginx level so the applications don\u2019t need to worry about that.\n\nNext, I had to add the Jupyter server to my docker-compose.yml . That was a relatively straightforward task of translating the Docker command:\n\njupyter:\n\nimage: jupyter/scipy-notebook:2c80cf3537ca\n\nvolumes:\n\n- ./notebooks:/home/jovyan\n\nports:\n\n- 8888:8888\n\nThe name of the service (jupyter) becomes the hostname for the Nginx process that is started by the same docker-compose.yml file, so Nginx can access it as http://jupyter:8888.\n\nOnce those changes were in place, I could commit and push them back to GitHub and then I needed to go to my GCP VM that hosts my PHP demo app. Once there, I changed the directory to phpappprod, which contains a clone of the repository, and ran the following:\n\nsudo docker-compose down\n\ngit pull\n\nsudo docker-compose up\n\nI didn\u2019t use the -d option on the docker-compose up because I wanted to see the logs right away in case there was an error in the configuration. Of course, there was a typo, so I had to fix it in my repository, push it back to GitHub, and then repeat the three commands above.\n\nYou will need a token, so when you start docker-compose (if you use the -d option), you will need to run the docker-compose logs command and you should see it printed out:\n\n\n\njupyter_1 |\n\njupyter_1 | Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,\n\njupyter_1 | to login with a token:\n\njupyter_1 | jupyter_1 | [C 14:27:54.889 NotebookApp]jupyter_1 |jupyter_1 | Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,jupyter_1 | to login with a token:jupyter_1 | http://localhost:8888/?token=a724f6aefa4e1800b436\n\nThe token will change every time you restart the server. But with the above, I was able to browse to https://jupyter.kamradtfamily.net/?token=a724f6aefa4e1800b436, log on with the single sign-on provided by Okta, and I get this:\n\nMy very own Jupyter instance running in the cloud! I copied the notebook steps that I had done on my local instance to make sure it works.\n\nBecause I\u2019m running the lowest-tier VM and I only have a 10G drive, I\u2019m almost out of room with all these applications, including the MariaDB that the PHP demo app is using. So if I really want something to use for large datasets, I will have to set it up elsewhere. I only added it to this VM so I could take advantage of the built-in single sign-on. It would also be interesting to see if I could hook it up with the MariaDB that coexists with the Jupyter server. The PHP demo app lists wine and cheese pairings. Maybe I can find some correlations. Of course, there are only two entries in the database so far, so that\u2019s not exactly big data.\n\nThere are a number of other options for using Jupyter online. Just Google \u201cjupyter in the cloud\u201d and you\u2019ll find lots of articles. Many are for full systems, but those will probably cost you a bit of money. The option I present here is just for play, but it\u2019s completely free, so you can take it for a test drive and get to know the features before you go out and spend money.",

        "title": "Mariah Carey Reclaims Her Legacy",
        "text": "\u201cThe Meaning of Mariah Carey\u201d: Book Review\n\nFor the past few years, Mariah has occasionally alluded to a plan to write a memoir in which she would share the story of her childhood, the truth behind the endless and outrageous tabloid rumors, and the inspiration for many of her most beloved songs. Earlier this year, she delighted fans with the announcement that this plan had become a reality and that the book would be released on September 29th.\n\nCo-written with author and activist Michaela Angela Davis, the memoir was released to some of the best reviews of Mariah\u2019s career and great commercial success (it topped the prestigious New York Times Bestseller list the week it debuted). And it deserves all of the critical and commercial success it received \u2014 and then some.\n\nMariah Carey does an in-depth interview with Oprah Winfrey to discuss the memoir (Image copyright: AppleTV)\n\nIt is no surprise to me that The Meaning of Mariah Carey is a great read. Mariah Carey\u2019s life story is a fascinating and entertaining one. The Cinderella-esque origin story is the stuff of legend and the tremendous ups and downs that followed have been fodder for the tabloids for the last three decades. It is almost impossible to tell this story in a manner that is not engaging. Also, I figured that if she is even half as good at writing prose as she is at lyrics, the memoir would be a thing of beauty.\n\nWhat did surprise me is the depth and timeliness of the book. She goes far beyond the typical trappings of the celebrity memoir and digs deep into painful, complicated discussions of issues related to racism, poverty, child abuse, misogyny, mental health, police brutality, dysfunctional family dynamics, and spirituality. This is no puff piece.\n\nThe memoir is told in four parts. The first is \u201cWayward Child,\u201d a searing look at her upbringing on Long Island with her Irish opera singer mother Patricia and her Black engineer father Alfred Roy, who divorced when she was a toddler. Her relationships with both of them, as well as her ill-fated older siblings named Morgan and Allison, are described with remarkable complexity. She describes their notable strengths and gives compassionate, empathic context to their failings, making it very clear that the boundaries she has famously drawn with them were out of self-preservation not a lack of love or respect. This section of the memoir helps fans truly understand how feeling so out of place as a biracial child and the truly traumatic events she endured were formative in Mariah\u2019s personal and artistic development, facts that have only been alluded to for most of her career.\n\nIn the cleverly titled second section \u201cSing Sing,\u201d Mariah recounts the early 1990s, a period when she had unprecedented, record-breaking commercial success but was trapped in a suffocating at best and abusive at worst relationship with the man who \u201cdiscovered\u201d her and controlled her career. Mariah is much more interested in telling us about the personal journey she went through during these years then recounting the writing and recording of the iconic songs and albums released during this time, although she certainly weaves in some delicious anecdotes (like the revelation that while recording Daydream she wrote and recorded a grunge album as a way of blowing off steam.) Tommy Mottola\u2019s denial of her blackness and misogynistic subjugation of her is sadly not surprising nor is it an uncommon experience, but I can\u2019t recall the last time it was captured so vividly on paper.\n\nAfter taking us through her divorce from Tommy, the liberation she experienced recording Butterfly, and her bold bid to get herself out of her oppressive record deal, Mariah takes a look at the low point of her career in the third section, entitled \u201cAll That Glitters.\u201d She gives context to how her disastrous film debut Glitter went so far off-course from its initial conception and the infamous breakdown she had during the time of its release. The chapters paint the portrait of a woman who, although admittedly struggling with her mental health, was driven to the breaking point by unrealistic demands by her record label and betrayal by loved ones. It is a painful, haunting segment that gives the necessary background to understand the breakdown of her personal and professional life.\n\nThe fourth and final section, entitled \u201cEmancipation,\u201d whisks through the nearly two decades that followed Glitter. Here the memoir becomes a bit less focused, but no less riveting and impactful, as it touches on a number of different areas, including how super producer LA Reid helped her achieve her astonishing comeback with 2005\u2019s The Emancipation of Mimi, her return to acting with the Oscar-winning film Precious, her whirlwind romance with Nick Cannon, the birth of her twins, and her interactions with countless legends (including Prince, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Nelson Mandela, and Muhammad Ali). The memoir ends with her basking in the joy of her sold-out Christmas concert in Madison Square Garden and the historic 19th #1 she obtained when \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d achieved the top spot.\n\nThe memoir is also fascinating for what is not in it. There is no mention of either of her ill-fated forays into reality television (as a judge on American Idol and as the subject of the docu-series Mariah\u2019s World), her alleged fling with Eminem that generated a musical showdown, her engagement to Australian billionaire James Packer, her supposed rivalry with other divas (although she indirectly references those she supposedly has with Celine Dion and Jennifer Lopez), criticisms that her voice is significantly degrading, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder that she boldly embraced on a People cover in 2018. I suppose its possible that she\u2019s embarrassed about these things and omitted them to save face or that she\u2019s saving some stories for a follow-up memoir, but I believe that the real reason she omitted them is the one she gave in numerous interviews that asked about them \u2014 they were blips in the timeline of her life that were beloved by tabloids but simply weren\u2019t integral to the meaning of Mariah Carey.\n\nClick here to read about Mariah going public about her mental health.\n\nThe memoir does a remarkable job of sticking with what is important about the personal and professional journey of Mariah Carey, with limited tangents. It beautifully integrates lyrics and artwork. (The audiobook version, which I have yet to experience, also weaves in musical interludes.) It also paints a remarkable portrait of the lingering psychological impacts and complex interactions of racism, sexism, and poverty in modern America. And through it all, Mariah\u2019s voice comes through. Her unshakable optimism, her under-appreciated wit, and her trademark mix of sophisticated vocabulary and playful slang make even the bleakest moments impossible to look away from.\n\nRating for \u201cThe Meaning of Mariah Carey\u201d: 5/5 stars",

        "title": "The answer is blowing in the wind: Harnessing real-time data to predict storm damage",
        "text": "By Glenn Fung, American Family Insurance data science research director\n\nWhen catastrophic storms strike, American Family Insurance deploys claims teams as quickly as possible to assess damage and help impacted customers begin to rebuild their lives. We\u2019re constantly monitoring the weather to help us anticipate areas that might be hit with severe storms and plan our claims response accordingly.\n\nFor example, we use radar detection and other technologies to forecast hail-related storm damage. This helps us pinpoint the geographic areas with the greatest needs and determine the proper number of claims adjusters, support personnel and equipment to dispatch.\n\nReal-time situational awareness allows us to make sound estimates about the size and scope of a severe weather event. It also leads to better outcomes for our customers.\n\nTechnology has come a long way in helping us more accurately forecast hail damage before our claims teams are deployed \u2014 and because hail causes extensive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 damage every year, the sooner we can respond, the better it is for our customers and our company.\n\nWind is also highly destructive to our customers\u2019 property, but our ability to estimate wind damage has historically been more limited.\n\nWe recognized there\u2019s an opportunity to improve the measurement of surface winds in near real-time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with Dr. Michael C. Morgan, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, along with researcher Brett Hoover, from the same department, to make it part of the overall weather patterns we monitor.\n\nSpecifically, we are exploring the use of updated numeric weather prediction output in conjunction with traditional measurement techniques \u2014 a first in the insurance industry \u2014 to generate a framework that will provide improved understanding of the surface wind field in near real-time, and more importantly, to be used as the foundation for a machine-learning methodology for forecasting insurance claims.\n\nTraining machines to predict the impact of severe weather\n\nThe common practice throughout the insurance industry is to glean information from disparate and sparse weather sensor instruments that measure and record wind velocity. We think, through a combination of tools, including machine learning, that we can more effectively measure wind as part of our overall weather monitoring.\n\nOur goal was to use various types of weather data as the foundation for a machine-learning methodology that would forecast the number and severity of storm-related insurance claims.\n\nAmerican Family currently uses an app by Opterrix, an American Family spinoff, to quantify and visually show the potential customer impact of severe weather events.\n\nHere\u2019s how we are making our forecast model more predictive: Multiple sources of weather-related data such as radar-derived estimates of hail size, damaging wind speed swaths and crowd-sourced storm reports are fed into Opterrix. That information is then fused with our policy and claims data to provide a comprehensive view of potential impact immediately following a storm.\n\nIn addition, weather forecast models generated in Amazon Web Service\u2019s cloud environment provide a 48-hour forecast four times a day. Each forecast model is initialized with updated weather observations from NOAA that provide predictions of multiple weather variables including precipitation, wind, temperature and pressure.\n\nThe output of these forecast models is then fed into Opterrix where several spatial algorithms will be used to simulate potential severe weather impact to our portfolio.\n\nHaving control of our own weather forecast model provides the opportunity to generate reanalysis data that can train machine learning algorithms to accurately predict potential severe weather outcomes. The process of reanalysis includes gathering archived weather forecasts for significant severe weather events and comparing it to our historical claims data from those events. Adding wind also gives us a fuller picture of the damaging storms.\n\nBy fusing historic claim and payment data with historic forecast models, we will be able to more accurately predict how future severe weather will impact our customers and our business and make better decisions based on this information.\n\nGlenn Fung is a data science and artificial intelligence (AI) expert with American Family Insurance. His main interests are optimization approaches to machine learning and AI, with emphasis in kernel methods. For more than a decade he has worked in industry \u2014 including at Siemens, Amazon and American Family Insurance \u2014 developing and applying novel machine learning techniques to solve challenging industry-related problems.",

        "title": "Working Together to Build a Big Data Future",
        "text": "To leverage Big Data and build an effective Artificial Intelligence infrastructure, enterprises must embrace collaboration.\n\nIn a digital economy, the rule of thumb tends to be that the smarter your use of data and technology, the more of a competitive edge your business has. A recent report by Teradata, based on over 260 interviews conducted by research firm Vanson Bourne with senior IT and business decision makers, found that there is widespread enthusiasm for adoption of AI, with 80 percent of enterprises reporting that they were already investing in the technology in some capacity, and over 30% planning to expand their investment in the are over the next 36 months.\n\n\u201cC-level executives \u2014 namely CIOs and CTOs, maintain they are committed to AI in their enterprise, because of the expected ROI over the next 10 years.\u201d The report therefore concludes that executives will accept those challenges as the long-term benefits clearly outweigh near-term pain. In fact their analysis showed that over a five-year forecast, organisations effectively expected to double their money when investing in AI: For every $1 spent on AI technologies, organisations predicted a return on investment of $1.23 over three years, $1.99 in five years, and $2.87 over a ten-year period.\n\nThe Economist \u2014 in a phrase that has since become rather clich\u00e9 \u2014 put forward the idea that \u201cdata is the new oil,\u201d and World Economic Forum has now designated Big Data as a new kind of economic asset, just like currency or gold.\n\nA study by the MIT Center for Digital Business confirms that data-driven businesses do indeed have the edge. It surveyed 330 leading U.S. Businesses and found that companies that focused strongly on data-driven decision-making had an average of four percentage points higher productivity and six percentage points higher profits.\n\nYet as these results indicate, it would perhaps be more accurate to say that data is in fact the new oxygen. Whereas it is still true that businesses that best leverage data and AI will gain a significant competitive advantage, it is probably fair to say that those that fail to make their organisations data-centric will eventually not be able to survive at all in the digital age.\n\nWhile most people agree on the essential role that Artificial Intelligence and Data play in their organisation\u2019s success, there are significant challenges. The overwhelming majority of business leaders surveyed in the Teradata report anticipated major barriers for adoption within their organisation, with roadblocks ranging from an inadequate IT infrastructure to shortage of in-house talent.\n\nIn their book The Sentient Enterprise, The evolution of Business Decision Making \u2014 launched at the Teradata Partners\u2019s Conference last month \u2014 Oliver Ratzesberger (Teradata\u2019s Chief Product Officer) and Mohanbir Sawhney from the McCormick foundation talk about how agility is key to getting the enterprise to the sentient point where it can analyse data and make decisions in real time.\n\nThe crux of the problem enterprises face lies not in the difficulty of gathering data, but in extracting insights and then turning these into actionable processes. The reality is that we live in a time of data overload, and companies can easily find themselves trapped in reactive mode, spending most of their time sifting through mountains of data and making decisions only when problems emerge, rather than anticipating them.\n\nTo tackle these problems, enterprises need access to key talent and infrastructure so as to enable the leveraging of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. Increasingly, this is not being done \u201cin house\u201d but rather in partnerships with dedicated providers. These go beyond the traditional SaaS and becomes much more of a \u201cPlatform as a Service\u201d model that incorporates complex customization and consultancy services.\n\nTeradata\u2019s Think Big Analytics team, for example, worked with Danske Bank to create a fraud-detection platform that uses machine leaning to analyse tens of thousands of latent features, scoring millions of online banking transactions in real-time to provide actionable insight regarding true, and false, fraudulent activity. Together, they built a framework within the bank\u2019s existing infrastructure, crating advanced machine learning models to detect fraud within millions of transactions per year, and in peak times, many hundreds of thousands per minute:\n\n\u201cUsing AI, we\u2019ve already reduced false positives by 50% and as such have been able to reallocate half the fraud detection unit to higher value responsibilities,\u201d explains Nadeem Gulzar, Head of Advanced Analytics, Danske Bank. \u201cThere is evidence that criminals are becoming savvier by the day; employing sophisticated machine learning techniques to attack, so it\u2019s critical to use advanced techniques, such as machine learning to catch them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll banks need a scalable, advanced analytics platform, as well as a roadmap and strategy for digitalization to bring data science into the organization.\u201d says Mads Ingwar, Client Services Director at Think Big Analytics. \u201cFor online transactions, credit cards and mobile payments, banks need a real-time solution \u2014 the platform we developed with Danske Bank scores transactions in less than 300 milliseconds. It means that when customers are standing in the supermarket buying groceries, the system can provide immediately actionable insight. This type of solution is one we\u2019ll begin to see throughout organizations in the financial services industry,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFintech company Verifi, also collaborates with banks and merchants to connect the multi-layered datastreams and combat fraud. The work the company does with is based on optimising data transmissions using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This is much more efficient because whereas legacy systems rely on processing large numbers of files sent in bulk, APIs can process data in real-time.\n\nThe Verifi system collates APIs from the merchant shopping cart, customer relationship management (CRM) system, shipping data system, and others, and provides the merchant with better information to handle charges disputed by consumers, allowing them to often resolve the issue directly rather than have the bank issue a chargeback. Merchants benefit as they\u2019re able to control the message to the consumer, and banks are happy because the sale remains and they reduce their operating costs. It the sort of technology enabled, data-driven system that is a true win-win.\n\nOne of the problems that such systems help tackle is so-called \u201cfriendly fraud,\u201d a term used to describe a situation when a customer experiences \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d and \u201ctries it on\u201d by putting in a claim directly with their bank or card issuer for a refund, when the sale did in fact legitimately occur. Julie Conroy, Research Director of the Aite Group says that in the U.S. friendly fraud and chargebacks would likely near $130 million, in Q1 2017 alone.\n\nRead and share the full article on ERP in News",

        "title": "Why Do Men Fare Worse With Covid-19?",
        "text": "Credit: krisanapong detraphiphat / Getty Images\n\nMen are nearly twice as likely to become severely sick and die from Covid-19 compared to women, research has shown. Now, a new study from Yale, published on Wednesday in Nature, gives new clues as to why men fare so much worse with the coronavirus.\n\nIt\u2019s the first study to look at the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 by sex, and it found that men produce an overall weaker immune response to the virus than women. \u201cWe now have clear data suggesting that the immune landscape in Covid-19 patients is considerably different between the sexes and that these differences may underlie heightened disease susceptibility in men,\u201d senior author Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, told Yale Medicine.\n\nThe researchers looked at 98 patients who were older than 60 on average, admitted to the Yale New Haven Hospital with confirmed Covid-19, and compared the initial immune responses in those who recovered from the disease to those who progressed to worse stages. They found that women\u2019s bodies produced more T cells, white blood cells that recognize and eliminate invading pathogens. The male study participants showed much weaker activation of those T cells, which correlated with how sick the men became. Given the findings, the researchers concluded that vaccines will play a particularly important role for men, especially those over age 60.\n\nWhile the study did not explain why these sex differences in the immune response to the coronavirus exist, the new findings are not overly surprising, considering that scientists know women generally yield faster and stronger immune responses. One possible explanation: In order to protect unborn or newborn children, the female body has a greater evolutionary need to fight pathogens effectively.",

        "title": "Artificial intelligence and the bleak, darkness that could befall us",
        "text": "These new intelligences could also bring with them some pretty terrible things, for us. First, though, there are likely some consequences that will arrive prior to the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) or ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence). We\u2019re already seeing some of these: automated weapons systems, increased surveillance activities, loss of privacy and anonymity. These are things that humans are directing machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics to do.\n\nThe motivations for these things are pretty clear \u2014 safety and security, strategic advantage, economic gains \u2014 because they are the same sort of things that have been motivating humans for millennia. While we may not agree with the tactics, we recognize why someone may use them.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the case with superintellligent AI systems. There won\u2019t likely be malice when we are eliminated. It just may be the most logical or efficient course of action. Referring back to the ants; we don\u2019t have malice when we wipe out a colony of ants to build a new highway. We simply don\u2019t think of the consequences for the ants because they don\u2019t warrant that type of concern. Which brings us to the largest fear that those involved in AI research have: that we are bringing about our extinction.\n\nCan\u2019t we just pull the plug? Don\u2019t they just do what we program them to do? They wouldn\u2019t want to hurt us, would they? Who would be in charge of an ASI? All these questions point out the big problem with developing AGI and, by proxy, ASI: we simply don\u2019t know what life will be like after ASI arrives. We\u2019re creating something that could change nearly everything but we really do not know in what ways.\n\nThere are four main scenarios where things could go very wrong for us:\n\nA self-improving, autonomous weapons system \u201cbreaks out\u201d. Various groups will race to develop the first ASI and use it to gain advantage and control. An ASI itself will turn malicious and seek to destroy us. We don\u2019t align the goals of the ASI with our own.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at each of these in turn and determine just which we should concern ourselves with the most.\n\n1. A self-improving, autonomous weapons system \u201cbreaks out\u201d.\n\n\u201c[Lethal autonomous robots] have been called the third revolution of warfare after gunpowder and nuclear weapons,\u201d says Bonnie Docherty of Harvard Law School. \u201cThey would completely alter the way wars are fought in ways we probably can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d And that \u201ckiller robots could start an arms race and also obscure who is held responsible for war crimes.\u201d\n\nMilitaries around the world are investing in robotics and autonomous weapon systems. There are good reasons for this that range from saving human lives (both soldiers and civilians) to greater efficiency. But what happens when an autonomous system with a goal to improve the efficiency with which it kills, reaches a point where it is no longer controllable. Unlike nuclear weapons, the difficulty and cost to acquire weaponized AI once it has been developed will be low and will allow terrorists and other rogue parties to purchase such technology on black markets. These actors won\u2019t show the relative restraint of nation-states. This is a very real problem and we\u2019ll see more news about this well before we get to a world with ASI.\n\n2. Various groups will race to develop the first ASI and use it to gain advantage and control.\n\nSimilar to the arms race mentioned above, nations, companies, and others will be competing to develop the first ASI because they know that the first one that is developed has a good chance of suppressing all others and being the only ASI ever to exist. In the opening chapter of his book Life 3.0 Max Tegmark lays out how a company that manages to build an ASI manages to take control over the world. The Tale of the Omega Team is worth the price of the book, in and of itself. It lays out all the advantages the \u201cfirst mover\u201d to AGI and then ASI gains and all of the rewards that come along with that. It will be hard to convince everyone on Earth to leave that fruit on the tree. This is one of the reasons I believe the move from ANI to AGI/ASI to be inevitable. I hope (maybe naively) that it is some group with good intentions that wins this \u201clast race\u201d.\n\nBut these stories need not be relegated to the hypothetical. Russia and China area racing to develop ever more sophisticated systems as the West tries to create guardrails.\n\n\u201c Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d \u2014Vladimir Putin September 2017, in a live video message beamed to 16,000 Russian schools.\n\n3. An ASI itself will turn malicious and seek to destroy us.\n\nUnlike the scenarios above, this requires the AI to \u201cwant\u201d to hurt humans of its own volition. Neither I, nor serious AI researchers are concerned with this scenario. AI won\u2019t want to hurt us because they won\u2019t want. They won\u2019t have emotions and they won\u2019t think like us. Anthropomorphizing\u00b2 machines/programs in this way, is not useful, and could actually be quite dangerous.\n\nIt will be very tempting to look upon these programs \u2014 that may indeed mimic human speech, comprehension, and emotions \u2014 and believe they are like us, that they feel like us and are motivated as we are. Unless we specifically attempt to create this in them, artificial intelligences will not be made in this image.\n\n4. We don\u2019t align the goals of the ASI with our own.\n\nThis is the scenario most AI safety researchers* spend most of their time on. The concept of aligning the goals of artificial intelligences with our own is important for a number of reasons. As we\u2019ve already defined, intelligence is simply the ability to accomplish complex goals. Turns out machines are very good at this. You could say that it is what we built them for. But as machines get more complex, so does the task of goal setting.\n\n* Yes, AI Safety is a thing that organizations like The Future of Life Institute and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) spend a lot of time studying.\n\nOne could make a compelling argument (if you\u2019re a biologist) that evolutionary biology really only has one primary goal for all life \u2014 to pass on genetic instructions to offspring via reproduction. Stated more crudely, our main goal as humans is to engage in sex and have babies. But as you may have noticed, even though we spend a fair bit of energy on the matter, that isn\u2019t the thing we do all the time. We have developed sub goals like eating, finding shelter, and socializing that serve to help keep us alive long enough to get to the sexy times. Once we have kids, even though all we have to do is raise them until they, themselves are old enough to procreate, we still find other things with which to occupy ourselves. We go on hikes, surf, take photos, build with LEGOs, walk our dogs, go on trips, read books, and write blog posts \u2014 all of which don\u2019t further our goal of passing on our genes.\n\nWe even do things to thwart our one job on planet Earth. Some of us use birth control or decide not to have children altogether. This flies in the face of our primary goal. Why do we do things like this? Let\u2019s refer to Max Tegmark\u2019s book Life 3.0 again:\n\nWhy do we sometimes choose to rebel against our genes and their replication goal? We rebel because by design, as agents of bounded rationality \u2014 we create/seek \u201crules of thumb\u201d, we\u2019re loyal only to our feelings. Although our brains evolved merely to help copy our genes, our brains couldn\u2019t care less about this goal since we have no feelings related to genes\u2026 In summary, a living organism is an agent of bounded rationality that doesn\u2019t pursue a single goal, but instead follows rules of thumb for what to pursue and avoid. Our human minds perceive these evolved rules of thumb as feelings, which usually (and often without us being aware of it) guide our decision making toward the ultimate goal of replication. [but] since our feelings implement merely rules of thumb that aren\u2019t appropriate in all situations, human behavior strictly speaking doesn\u2019t have a single well-defined goal at all.\u00b9\u00b3\n\n\u201cThe real risk with AGI isn\u2019t malice but competence. A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren\u2019t aligned with ours, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nEvery post about AI existential risk must mention the \u201cpaperclip parable\u201d. Tap the paperclips for a game.\n\nEvery post about AI existential risk must mention Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom\u2019s \u201cpaperclip parable\u201d.\u00b9\u2074 Sorta like a restatement of the genie or Midas problems, or \u2014 restated \u2014 be careful what you wish for.\n\n\u201cBut, say one day we create a super intelligence and we ask it to make as many paper clips as possible. Maybe we built it to run our paper-clip factory. If we were to think through what it would actually mean to configure the universe in a way that maximizes the number of paper clips that exist, you realize that such an AI would have incentives, instrumental reasons, to harm humans. Maybe it would want to get rid of humans, so we don\u2019t switch it off, because then there would be fewer paper clips. Human bodies consist of a lot of atoms and they can be used to build more paper clips. If you plug into a super-intelligent machine with almost any goal you can imagine, most would be inconsistent with the survival and flourishing of the human civilization.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nick Bostrom, Paperclip Maximizer at LessWrong\n\nSo what should we do about this? AI/Human goal alignment is likely to be a recurring theme here at AltText for a while so we will only touch on it now. Life 3.0 puts forth a pretty basic-sounding plan designed to make future AI safe, involving:\n\nMaking AI learn our goals Making AI adopt our goals Making AI retain our goals\n\nSounds simple enough but it is actually incredibly difficult to define and carry-out a plan like this. And we may only get one shot with it, since the first ASI is likely to be the only one to ever be created.\n\nThis goal-alignment problem will be the deciding factor of whether we become immortal or extinct when artificial super intelligence becomes a reality.",

        "text": "Bringing Colab to a Jupyter Notebook near you\u2026\n\nGoogle has built some nice features in Colab. Now you can benefit from some of these in Jupyter Notebook.\n\nIt\u2019s errors all the way down\n\nWhen programming in Python, it can be quite overwhelming when you hit an error deep down in a stack of nested function calls. One of the advantages of Python is that it has an enormous amount of high quality libraries available and for which the source code is readily available. Sometimes, it is useful just to be able to dig in to it in order to be able to understand what is going on.\n\nTo help you do just this, Google Colab automatically displays clickable links to the source files in the stack trace, as well as a handy button that searches for the error in Stack Overflow. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if Jupyter Notebook could do the same? That\u2019s what I thought, so I decided to create a Notebook Extension that does exactly that.\n\nGoto Error Notebook extension\n\nIf you have not already installed Jupyter Notebook extensions, you can do this by typing\n\npip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n\nDownload the Goto Error code from GitHub with\n\ngit clone git://github.com/teticio/nbextension-gotoerror\n\ninstall it like so\n\njupyter nbextension install nbextension-gotoerror\n\nand finally, enable it thusly\n\njupyter nbextension enable nbextension-gotoerror/main\n\nIf all goes to plan, you should be able to configure the Goto Error extension in the nbextensions tab of Jupyter Notebook.\n\nAs the Jupyter server is only able to access files in the directory in which it is run or a subdirectory, for the notebook to be able to open the source files it is necessary to provide a soft link to the source file directory. For example, if you don\u2019t use virtual environments, make soft link in the Jupyter launch directory to the site-packages directory of your Python installation (e.g. ~/lib/python3.6/site-packages ) and call this site-packages . Then set the prefix parameter in the nbextension configuration to ~/lib/python3.6 .\n\nIf you do use virtual environments, then point the soft link to the envs directory and set the prefix parameter accordingly.\n\nTo make a soft link in Linux:\n\nln -s ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages site-packages\n\nTo make a soft link in Windows:\n\nmklink -d envs C:\\users\\teticio\\Anaconda\\python\\envs\n\nIt should now work just like the following example.\n\nYou want more?\n\nGoogle Colab has some other great features (apart from free access to GPUs and TPUs!). For example, if you add a #@param comment to the end of a line, it will automatically create a form which allows the user to input a value. For example\n\nfred = 123 #@param {type : 'number'}\n\npops up a form with \u2018fred\u2019 and the number 123. If you change the number in the form to 456, say, the code is changed to\n\nfred = 456 #@param {type : 'number'}\n\nI\u2019d like to develop an extension for Jupyter Notebook that does the same thing and, while I\u2019m at it, port both of these extensions to Jupyter Lab. Please let me know if this is something that you would use.",

        "title": "Subject, Consumer, or Citizen: Three Post-Covid Futures",
        "text": "Like all of us I suspect, I\u2019m currently feeling a wild mix of emotions, from fear for the wellbeing of friends and loved ones, to anxiety about our work and the business we\u2019ve built, to concern and indeed guilt when I think of the many people facing lockdown in situations far worse than mine; and alongside those immediate personal responses an intense collision of hope and fear for our collective future. This piece, really written with and by the whole team, is an initial attempt to draw on the thinking and work we at New Citizenship Project have done over the last five years to make sense, partly to ground our own work in this time, and partly with an ambition to offer something that can help the people we have worked with over the years to do the same. We would love to hear any thoughts, comments and ideas it provokes.\n\nThe Crucible\n\nThe great paradox of this moment is that our society is moving slower, yet at the same time changing faster and more fundamentally, than it has for decades. All of us are adapting, and this is just the beginning. This is still the time, first and foremost, to keep our businesses afloat, our children educated, and our relatives looked after. But in an only slightly broader view, this is also a time of tremendous and urgent importance. This moment is a crucible from which our society, economy and politics \u2014 and more importantly all of the organisations, large and small, that make those up \u2014 will emerge as different beasts.\n\nAt the New Citizenship Project, we have a particular way of seeing this challenge. Since 2015, we have been working from the understanding that in the broad historical moment of the early 21st century, we are entering the era of the Citizen: a time when people, dissatisfied with being mere Consumers, increasingly yearn for agency and control over what matters to them, and where authentic participation based on agency and purpose holds the key to a brighter future. These are ideas that have earned a platform and stimulated change at organisations from The Guardian to the Co-op to the European Central Bank.\n\nNow, with Covid-19, the historical moment has ceased to be broad, and become immediate. In this context, our purpose here is to offer our underlying framework, in the hope it might be helpful in three ways:\n\nas a lens to help make sense of what is happening;\n\nof what is happening; as a way of framing the deep choice that we now face collectively; and\n\nthe deep choice that we now face collectively; and as an invitation to step into the agency we all have \u2014 even now \u2014 to shape the future.\n\nThe Citizen Shift\n\nFive years ago, we published a report called This Is The #CitizenShift, laying out the core ideas that continue to underpin all our work.\n\nOur argument was that there are broad historical moments when the dominant moral story of our society changes. At the start of the 20th century and for centuries before, we were Subjects: the right thing to do was to keep our heads down, do our duty and be content with our lot, while the God-given few led society forward. Through two world wars, this story collapsed. In the decades that followed, we became Consumers: the right thing to do was to look out for ourselves, to choose the best deal from those that were offered, to produce whatever people would consume, because if we did the best society would result.\n\nOur report argued that, in the 21st century, we are now living through another moment of collapse and rebirth: a shift from Consumer to Citizen. Now, the right thing for us to do is to get involved, to step into our own power to shape the world for the better, and to open up opportunities to do so for others. The flaws of the Consumer story have been badly exposed by the financial crisis and the climate emergency, and the digital era has created new spaces for participation that we can use to replace it with the Citizen story.\n\nSubject Consumer Citizen: Quickfire Concepts \u2014 from This Is The #CitizenShift\n\nThe urgency of Now\n\nThis understanding frames our mission at the New Citizenship Project: working with organisations of all shapes and sizes to help them build and inhabit the Citizen story. We support and challenge the organisations we work with to name and recognise Consumer logic in what they do, and to adopt new behaviours and structures which channel people\u2019s ideas, energy and resources (to use the language of our friends at Lincolnshire Coop), not just sell them stuff.\n\nAs we have been doing this work, we have been thinking and learning about how the big societal change will happen: how the Citizen will move from an emergent possibility to become the new dominant story.\n\nWith Covid-19, two things have changed in our view.\n\nFirst, this just got very real: the historical moment is no longer broad, but immediate.\n\nSecond, it has become clear that the step forward into the Citizen story cannot be taken for granted: the dominant story will be contested, and there is no guarantee this story will win.\n\nThis, then, is how we understand what is happening right now. We are living through a contest between these three deep stories. All three are present and alive in this moment. One will emerge as dominant, and which it is will dramatically shape our collective future.\n\nThree possible futures\n\nThe Consumer story could be restored. This is what \u201cback to normal\u201d would mean. It would be a little like the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. Some part of all of us wants this very badly: our commutes, our coffees, our crises put back where they were so we can \u201copen back up\u201d and pick up where we left off. And there will be powerful interests and an awful lot of money put into making this happen for us: a recent piece by Julio Vincent Gambuto brings this to life with a powerful prediction of the \u201cultimate gaslighting\u201d, as billions of pounds are spent persuading us to pretend that nothing ever happened.\n\nThe Subject story is also making a very big comeback. We are already seeing not only the accentuation of already appalling levels of inequality, but also near-universal acceptance \u2014 even embrace \u2014 of radically reduced civil liberties. If there is a part of us that wants to go back to normal, there is another that is reassured by the idea that someone else is in charge. This is a story that has a clear path to develop, build and take over. There is significant potential for mass surveillance programmes to come into operation and be framed as essential to the lightening of lockdown, tracking people in order to track the virus. Hungary and Israel have already been described as the first \u201cvirus dictatorships\u201d; it is all too plausible that others could follow.\n\nThe huge opportunity, though, is to make this the moment when we choose to step forward together into the Citizen story. We are already seeing the myriad ways that people, communities and organisations are reclaiming agency and finding purpose within the present moment, despite the restriction of individual freedoms. Mutual Aid groups and hyperlocal self-organising units have sprung up everywhere. Businesses and suppliers are coming together rather than simply competing. Some central government departments and more local authorities (though not all) are making interventions that seek to sustain, channel and develop agency, not just treat people as self-interested individuals to be policed or \u201cnudged\u201d into compliance. There is a part of us that is deeper and more fundamental, and has been more starved, that is nourished by this, a part we feel when we look across the fence, clap the NHS, and act for someone we do not know. This too could grow. This does not just have to be a nice side effect; it could be the beginning of the new story.\n\nThese are the three ways forward from here. To be brutally frank, two will simply result in continual and cascading failure, for organisations of all types and for humanity as a whole. If we return to the Consumer story, we will be back to square one on the challenges of climate and inequality (and more) that this story has arguably created, having eaten time we do not have. In short order, we will be back in crisis. The Subject story is even worse, restoring the standing challenges but with the addition of the kind of cover-ups and conspiracies that will hamper progress and slow change even more. In short order, we will be back in crisis. Both scenarios are seductive, because they\u2019re familiar, but they won\u2019t work.\n\nThe Citizen story is the only one that actually works. But it is the most difficult, because it is unfamiliar: we are still early on in the imagining and shaping of a Citizen society. The institutions and processes are not \u201coff the peg\u201d. We have work to do. All of us.\n\nThe agency we all have\n\nThere is of course much in this moment that sits in the hands of national governments, more than has been the case for decades. But to leave that statement to stand bare and unexamined is to walk the path to the Subject story, or at best the Consumer. The Citizen story by contrast adds two important qualifications: first, that government in a democracy is, in principle, government by Citizens \u2014 i.e. all of us are involved \u2014 not government of Citizens; and second, that the space for government is defined by wider society \u2014 the communities we live in, and the organisations we work for. With this understanding, we restore our agency, our power to shape the future, both individually and collectively.\n\nIn this view, indeed, the bigger truth is that no government can make the Citizen story happen for us. It will require communities across the country and the world, and organisations from across sectors to lead into new ways of thinking and operating \u2014 and it will require this to be driven by individuals who have the courage to think and act differently, learning more from their peers and fellow Citizens in other sectors than from the previously established norms of their own worlds.\n\nThis has to some extent always been the case, but it is so much more true in times of flux and uncertainty. Careers, reputations, and legacies will be made in the coming months, many of them apparently from nowhere. Organisations of all sectors will reorient dramatically. That is what it means for society to reshape. This is a huge moment of opportunity for us all, individually and collectively.\n\nThere are no answers yet as to exactly how to do this. As a starting point, then, here are three levels of questions we offer you to ask yourself, and that we are asking ourselves.\n\nAs an individual Citizen\u2026\n\nHow can you find and build agency in your own life in this moment, even through small actions? How can you recognise in yourself when you are being treated as a Subject or a Consumer? How can you call this out when it happens? How can you recognise when you yourself act towards others as Citizens, creating opportunities for them to express their agency?\n\nAs a Citizen of a local community\u2026\n\nHow can you find a level of connection to the place where you are that works for you? How can you make a contribution that you can sustain and that is right for you? How can you develop your understanding of where power lies locally \u2014 what councils and authorities are there? How are they operating and treating people locally? How can you help or perhaps challenge them to do it better?\n\nAs a Citizen of your organisation/employer\u2026\n\nHow do you understand the purpose of your organisation? What is it really there in the world to do, and what could it be? How could your organisation operate differently in order to create more space for people to find their agency, and share in its purpose, not just transact? How could your organisation involve people more directly and actively? How could you start or build something in this moment, even something small, that could grow?\n\nUltimately, all these questions stem from one that is deeper and more fundamental:\n\nWhat would you do in this time if you truly believed in yourself and in those around you?\n\nThis is happening\n\nWe want to close for now by saying that we see the people we have worked with over the years leaning into this already, and indeed we have got this far with our understanding by watching you.\n\nWe\u2019re already inspired by Kirklees Council with their approach to partnering with and supporting community organisations rather than attempting to either replace or manage them (see Community Response Kirklees); the Guardian working with readers and communities through initiatives like Anywhere But Westminster to understand the true impact of the virus; the Co-op seeking to put its member participation platform in service of community support; and perhaps most of all by the University of Bath Students\u2019 Union (The SU Bath) for the energy, commitment and all-round Citizenship -small and big \u2018C\u2019 - of their officers, staff and members (not least in their work with Bath and North East Somerset Third Sector Group, another organisation we hugely admire).\n\nOver the last five years, we\u2019ve built a business out of both celebrating and supporting organisations of all sectors to build the Citizen story. In the coming weeks, we\u2019re going to be looking for more examples like this to celebrate, organisations reframing and reinventing their relationships with people to build and distribute agency, and talking to the people who are doing it; and if we can help you be part of it, we\u2019re here.\n\nThis is a crucial time, a difficult time, and a dangerous time. But it is a time when the Citizen Shift is very much on the cards.",

        "text": "1. Become an idea-machine\n\nGenerating ideas is a common struggle amongst writers. The blank page is the enemy, and they don\u2019t know how to make its blood spill. This holds them back from writing.\n\nHow is it that even though ideas come from everywhere you\u2019re not receiving them at all? There\u2019s only one reason why: you don\u2019t have an open mind.\n\nThough not on purpose, you\u2019re regularly consuming the same type of content, and therefore, thinking the same thoughts.\n\nHow are you supposed to write about new topics when new ideas aren\u2019t entering your head?\n\nTo become an idea-machine, you need to be open to everything \u2014 even if it\u2019s random and unrelating to your niche.\n\nEven though you write about productivity, don\u2019t read another book about that subject. If, while you were browsing online, a history book about Kennedy piqued your interest, read that. Rather than watching another class on writing, watch the interior design course you\u2019ve been eyeing.\n\nYou\u2019re not digging for ideas about history or interior design. You\u2019re putting yourself in a position to get a thought that leads to another thought that turns into an idea that transforms into an entire article.\n\nEven looking up from your phone and staring at the sky and the trees and the ocean lets ideas bubble in your brain until they explode on the page.\n\nIf you find nothing out in the world, look inside yourself. Ask yourself what you feel, how you feel, about your dreams and hopes and fears. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll discover various stories, memories, and lessons.\n\nBy consuming and doing different things you start having different thoughts.\n\nIf you have ideas, especially ones that excite you, you\u2019re going to want to sit and write. Nothing will stop you then \u2014 not until you\u2019ve told the whole story.",

        "text": "Context is everything\n\nWhy is it when someone gives a great speech, even if everyone in the audience agrees, very few take action?\n\nContext is everything. When you read or listen to something, your context needs to be right for it to sink into your soul and take effect.\n\nLet\u2019s break down a person\u2019s context.\n\nAbility to understand\n\nYou don\u2019t teach 5-year-olds about quantum mechanics. They don\u2019t have the capacity to understand it. That doesn\u2019t mean they never will. Their brains just aren\u2019t there yet.\n\nIn the same way, just because something is true doesn\u2019t mean everyone is able to understand and apply it. That\u2019s why life advice from parents often goes over the child\u2019s head. Their mentality isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nTiming\n\nBased on what\u2019s going on in your life, you react to things differently. Someone who just graduated college is more likely to absorb career advice than someone still in high school. Both are able to understand it, it\u2019s just more applicable to the former.\n\nThat\u2019s why you can hear the same thing for years but never take it in. Adele\u2019s music only started speaking to me when I went through a breakup. It\u2019s all timing.\n\nHow it\u2019s presented\n\nPeople react differently to the way information is presented.\n\nSome people are heavy readers. Others are better listeners. Some people like to be pushed. Others like to be lovingly encouraged.\n\nI used to be more of the \u2018Jay Shetty\u2019 kind of listener. I appreciated the calm, gentle advice he gave. But at some point, I realized it didn\u2019t really push me to make changes. I agreed with everything but didn\u2019t really internalize it.\n\nThen I switched to Gary Vee. He had a more direct, no-nonsense, \u2018kick up the backside\u2019 approach which really got me out of my comfort bubble.\n\nDelivery is also important. Nobody wants to listen to an arrogant, selfish know-it-all. You are more inclined to listen when someone talks with care, humility, and a genuine interest to help you.\n\nWe evolve\n\nYour context affects how you receive information, but you also grow as a person. You won\u2019t be the same person in 5 years. You shouldn\u2019t be, anyway.\n\nLife gives you challenges and victories that teach and define you.\n\nYou learn more.\n\nYour circumstances change.\n\nYou meet new people.\n\nYou move on to the next stage in life\n\nYour perspective changes.\n\nSo every encounter with knowledge should be looked at with new eyes.\n\nI\u2019ve read some of the same books again and again throughout my life and each time I read them I find something new. I\u2019m able to make connections I didn\u2019t make before. The beauty of timeless wisdom is each time you encounter it, your understanding deepens.\n\nEven watching some of my favorite cartoons years later, I now spot the adult jokes that flew over my head as a kid. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t mind revisiting some of my favorite talks, articles, books, and movies. It\u2019s not about excitement. It\u2019s the added insight and appreciation I get each time.",

        "text": "The Song\n\nPutting the strengths of the album aside, its title track easily the best song I\u2019ve heard in 2018, and one of my favorites of all time. This is the kind of song that I have to force myself to stop listening to, lest I get sick of it; the kind of song that I want to put on every playlist; the kind of song that reminds me why I love music. \u201cNearer My God\u201d is hauntingly beautiful, and I\u2019ll do my best to describe why in the next few paragraphs.\n\nAs best I can tell, the lyrics are a self-reflection on the band\u2019s existence and their careers. Murphy opens the track by yelling \u201cI want it all,\u201d continuing, just a few lines later, with \u201cCause I\u2019d sell my soul/To be America\u2019s pool boy/The crown centerfold/My few good years left, a tribute/To anyone who wants me at all/Does anybody want me at all?/Oh, do you want me at all?\u201d Set against a piercing backdrop of music that I can only describe as haunting, Murphy\u2019s desperation and anxiety are almost palpable.\n\nWhat must it feel like to dedicate one\u2019s life to learning a craft (in this case music) only to question these decisions a few years in? What kind of anguish must rise out of years devoted writing and singing, followed by this kind of uncertainty? I\u2019m not musically inclined, but I can only imagine that this feeling must be crippling. After hearing this song a few times, I admire the honestly and openness that led to its creation.\n\nLyrical brilliance aside, the specific ways that the music\u2019s climactic moments fit with the lyrics is the final ingredient to this song. After Murphy asks \u201cDo you want me at all?\u201d multiple times, the background music swells into a piercing crescendo that divides the first half of the song from the second and is one of the most impressive musical moments I have ever experienced. When Murphy\u2019s voice enters the track again a few measures later, the lyrics flip from wanting musical fame to poking holes in the very vision that he longed after moments before. \u201cI\u2019ve got it all,\u201d he sings, sounding no happier than before.\n\nAt just a few minutes long, this song still feels emotionally exhausting. It\u2019s clear that it took a tremendous amount of courage and work to put these lyrics and notes together, and the end result \u2014 when listened to closely \u2014 conveys these elements well. It may not be the most accessible song, or the easiest to listen to, but the value and beauty here can\u2019t be missed.",

        "text": "What Are The Benefits Of Cloud Data Warehousing?\n\nAnd Should You Switch\n\nData warehousing was introduced in 1988 by IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy.\n\nSince then the concept has evolved and taken on a life of its own. Increasing challenges and complexities of business have forced data warehousing to become a distinct discipline. Over the years this has led to best business practices, improved technologies, and hundreds of books being published on the topic.\n\nImage Source: Seattle Data Guy\n\nBut we don\u2019t want to focus on the past.\n\nInstead, this article will discuss the future of data warehousing and how it has been impacted by the cloud. Over the past decade, we have seen multiple new cloud data warehousing technologies pop up and be responsible for the largest software IPOs in history.\n\nAll because of a data warehouse.\n\nA technology and discipline that is rarely even discussed in most computer science or IT degrees in college. Yet almost every large and medium organization has some form of the data warehouse.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated by the year 2025 that the data warehouse market will near double from its current 18 billion USD market cap to 30 billion USD.\n\nIn this article, we will not only discuss why so many businesses are willing to invest in a data warehouse but we will also discuss how the cloud has improved data warehouses as well as leveled the playing field for businesses of all sizes.\n\nSo whether you want to learn more about data warehousing or you are a director, small business owner, or CEO this article will help you understand the vast world of data warehousing.",

        "text": "My Nervous System Needs To Talk\n\nHe Just Has To Get This Off My Chest\n\nPhoto by camilo jimenez on Unsplash\n\nHi, I\u2019m Max\u2019s nervous system. No this is not a Reader\u2019s Digest parody. I just have to vent.\n\nSometimes Max does not work the way he should and that drives me nuts.\n\nThe other day, for example. You know he spends a lot of time alone writing things. You might think that would be stimulating to me, but have you seen some of the stuff he writes?\n\nThe point is, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s getting enough human interaction. So, when he does encounter someone, it can result in an embarrassing and frustrating experience. Take yesterday for instance.\n\nWe were going to the mailbox and happened to see a neighbor.\n\nIt could have been quick:\n\n\u201cHow ya doin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. How about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing well, thanks.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pleasant, efficient, and not embarrassing. But ol\u2019 Max couldn\u2019t leave it at that. He had to actually tells this guy how he was feeling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten out of my routine,\u201d said Max. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked out for a couple of days and my back is letting me know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the other guy, \u201cYou work out?\u201d\n\nFor cryin\u2019 out loud! This guy didn\u2019t get the message that Max would answer his questions? Sometimes in great detail?\n\nThat was all Max needed. He was off and running. He\u2019s like the person you ask for the time and they tell you how a watch is made.\n\nI could tell Max\u2019s mouth was moving and something was gushing out of it, but I didn\u2019t care what it was. I just wanted it stopped.\n\nI put in a 911 call to his brain.\n\n\u201cThis call may be recorded for training purposes.\n\nMax\u2019s brain is engaged right now. Your call is important to us neurons and we will take your call in the order in which it was received.\n\nYour estimated wait time can not be determined, because Max\u2019s mouth is spewing stuff out like the mighty Niagara going over the falls.\u201d\n\nI wanted to hang on and listen to the hold music because it was that 80s one-hit-wonder \u201cHold On Eileen\u201d by Dexy\u2019s Midnight Runners. But I had to make him stop.\n\nAs a neuro system, I tend to be the physical type, but, still on hold to his brain, I decided to try something spiritual.\n\nPerhaps an appeal to his empathy for the suffering of others would make him stop tormenting that poor man.\n\nI called his soul.\n\nNo luck on the soul. He had spotted the trouble early and made his exit. When I found him, he was having an out of body experience and had got tangled up in the branches of a tree overhead.\n\nI knew the soul was as troubled as me. He was shouting in tones no one could hear, \u201cMax, shut up! Please stop talking!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Max\u2019s tongue was still going like it was trying the beat his brains out from the inside. The fellow listening to this tirade had the look of an animal in a snare about to gnaw his foot off.\n\nWhen Max gets going like that, he can become nonsensical. He\u2019s not far from that on a good day.\n\nI was still on hold with Max\u2019s brain. My God, now it was playing \u201cRockstar\u201d by Nickelback. Things were getting worse.\n\nNickelback. Back. Then I had it. His back. I have total control there. His back is his Achilles Heel.\n\nIt just took one sharp tweak. Max flinched and the listener was free.\n\nMax\u2019s spirit fell out of the tree and returned to its rightful place.\n\nA customer service neuron came on the line from the brain.\n\n\u201cThank you for holding. What is your emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo emergency,\u201d I said. \u201cBut could you play something soothing like Debussy?\u201d\n\nMax muttered a reproach to himself for neglecting his work out routine and we got the mail.",

        "title": "The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator \u2014 Timothy Winegard",
        "text": "The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator \u2014 Timothy Winegard\n\nA terrific subject and stirring information are tethered to a book that unfortunately loses credibility as you dig deeper\n\nMicrohistory is taking over the nonfiction market, and the newest addition, Timothy Winegard\u2019s The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator is a perfect example of the intriguing subgenre. If you\u2019re not familiar with \u201cmicrohistory\u201d, it is a relatively new trend that takes a specific subject and tracks it throughout (usually) the history of the world. Examples are Mark Kurlansky\u2019s books Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, Salt: A World History, and Milk!: A 10,000-Year Food Fracas. (If this subgenre interests you or you now realize, like me, that you love these kinds of books, take a look through Book Riot\u2019s terrific list of 50 must-read microhistories.)\n\nTimothy Winegard\u2019s brand new The Mosquito is a great addition to the realm of microhistory in a couple of different ways. First, it\u2019s surprising that this book has not already been written, considering the popularity of microhistory and the importance of mosquitoes in world history, as Winegard deftly explains in the book. Also, there is simply a great wealth of historical information in this book, all told through the lens of the mosquito but branching out in many surprising directions. I have not thought about mosquitoes the same way since reading this book, and that is part of the point. I don\u2019t even remember Kurlansky\u2019s Milk! affecting me in quite the same way. However (and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d that I will deal with in detail below), I found several historical assertions or bits of information in The Mosquito that were either overstated or flat incorrect. This has really colored my perception of the book, and it has something I have been sifting through mentally for weeks now.\n\nBut first, the good. Winegard is a skilled writer that knows how to weave a good historical narrative. He also makes a great case for his main thesis, which is essentially that the mosquito, a tiny insect that can be swatted in an instant, might have had the greatest influence on world history of any non-human entity. Winegard states that some researchers have estimated mosquitoes are responsible for the death of almost half the humans that have ever lived. Even as diseases like malaria and yellow fever have either disappeared or been isolated to certain world regions, mosquitoes kill more humans per year than any other being, including other humans (if you, like Winegard, don\u2019t count abortions, but I digress).\n\nWinegard weaves the story of the mosquito through all* of world history, from speculation about whether mosquitos were responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs to modern attempts to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases. The breadth of time covered is outstanding, considering the speculative nature of the subject as you go further back in history. Winegard is not afraid to speculate and give an idea of where the scholarship is on a specific question, like what killed the dinosaurs or the positive effects of the marshes on Ancient Rome\u2019s defensive capabilities. He even has a very interesting theory about how mosquitoes aided in the spread of Christianity because the religion \u201cpreached care for the sick as a recognized Christian duty.\u201d This analysis of the mosquito from every angle and its effect on several major movements and developments in world history makes The Mosquito a very useful source for anyone interested in history.\n\n*(\u201cAll\u201d is more a reference to the time periods the book covers and not the regions of the world. The Mosquito is very focused on Western civilization to the detriment of almost any discussion of Africa or Asia. There is a 10-page chapter on the Mongols, but that\u2019s it. I got excited when one page had an illustration of Japanese treatments for mosquito-borne diseases, but there was no mention of Japan on that page or anywhere else in the book. However, I am willing to give Winegard a slight pass on the Eurocentric nature of the book because I\u2019m sure it is more difficult to work with non-Western sources of this nature and he is writing a mass-market history book, not an academic one. I would have just loved to see China, India, Japan, or any African country get a little bit of love.)\n\nOne specific positive of Winegard\u2019s book is his writing style. He is able to tell stories well and injects humor often in order to make his points. One example sticks out to me, when writing about Herodotus\u2019 narrative of Egyptian treatments for malaria:\n\n(Herodotus) also reveals that the prevailing Egyptian practice for treating malarial fevers was to bathe in fresh human urine. Having never contracted malaria, I can only assume that its symptoms are so unbearably severe that a pampering soak in sparkling, steaming urine issuing from your thoughtful and upstanding servants is worth a shot for some well-deserved relief.\n\nNot only can that excerpt be laugh-out-loud funny depending on your style of humor, but the words he uses are evocative and almost disturbing, which is a good thing when you are describing the horrific things Winegard relays in The Mosquito.\n\nFor all these reasons, I wanted to love The Mosquito. And part of me did. But I had some serious problems with multiple portions of Winegard\u2019s historical examples and analyses. So here comes the negativity.\n\nI was rolling along very happily in the book until I reached the chapter on mosquitoes and the development of Christianity. Winegard makes several great points, including one about how Constantine\u2019s decree did not make Christianity the official religion but instead simply proclaimed religious toleration for Christianity. But then he makes statement that is simply and completely incorrect. He writes:\n\nIn 325, Constantine went one step further at the Council of Nicaea. To placate the adherents of the diverse and assorted polytheistic and Christian factions, and end religious purges, he blended their beliefs into one faith. Constantine ratified the Nicene Creed and the concept of the Holy Trinity, opening the doors for the compilation of the current Bible and modern Christian doctrine.\n\nOK. This lights a fire under me specifically, but let\u2019s look at it factually. This connection between Christianity and polytheistic factions in Europe is pointed out often, and no doubt some syncretism occurred in areas large and small. Christian practices incorporated polytheistic practices all over Europe, the most obvious of which is seen in Western Christmas traditions, but syncretism between Christianity and European polytheism did not ever reach the level of universal church doctrine. Councils like Nicaea were convened to ensure this. Both points Winegard makes here, about the Biblical canon and the Trinity, are listed under \u201cMisconceptions\u201d in the Council of Nicaea article on Wikipedia. (Yes, I know, Wikipedia is not a great source for research, but major articles are reliable and it is a good jumping off point for research. If Winegard had consulted Wikipedia at all instead of whatever sources he is spuriously using here, he would have seen sources to rebut his narrative and would not have made this mistake.)The Biblical canon had, essentially but not officially, been formed far before the Council of Nicaea, and the source of the misconception that it was formed at Nicaea is a pseudo-historical account by Voltaire. And, although the doctrine of the Trinity was formally put forward by Christians at least as early as the second century, it was not officially decided upon in the Catholic Church until after Nicaea and as far as we know the Trinity was not discussed at Nicaea. The focus instead was on the deity of Christ.\n\nA mistake in one excerpt isn\u2019t a huge deal. Then, in the aforementioned chapter on the Mongols, Winegard mentions that they had begun to conquer large swaths of eastern Europe and infers that mosquitoes were a major reason that the Mongols failed to conquer western Europe. He makes no allusion to the real reason they turned back: Ogedei Khan died, and there was a struggle for power, so Batu and his army abandoned the war in order to join the struggle to elect a successor back in the empire\u2019s center. Could mosquito-borne diseases be a reason that they never returned? Possibly. But the lack of detail hurts the credibility of Winegard\u2019s narrative.\n\nThen I encountered a very problematic passage that made me rethink a lot of what Winegard has to say. In the chapter on the American Revolution, he makes this statement:\n\nIn December 1773, shortly after the ratification of the Tea Act, a strategic yet spiteful band of the Sons of Liberty disguised only in blankets and lampblack (not in the mythical Mohawk Indian regalia commonly portrayed) heaved 342 chests containing 90,000 pounds of tea into Boston Harbor during their Tea Party.\n\nWait, the colonists weren\u2019t dressed as Mohawks like I\u2019ve heard for my entire life? This is big news, so I looked for a source. None in the notes in the back of the book. Google is up next. Can\u2019t find anything. I can literally find no source to back up Winegard\u2019s American-history-altering statement. Usually you can find a source on the internet that says anything, you just have to weigh competing sources to find the most likely answer. Not in this case. It\u2019s possible I can\u2019t find whatever source he is referencing here, but everything I could find upholds the fact that some of the Sons of Liberty were wearing Indian garb. Not all of them, and not all in full native headdresses as commonly portrayed, but definitely in Indian dress. (Hey look, I\u2019m actually including a link to my source to back up what I\u2019m saying, and the source includes quotes from actual eyewitnesses to the event.) I welcome Winegard\u2019s rebuttal and would love to see his sourcing, but this really bothered me.\n\nAfter the Boston Tea Party sourcing fiasco, I went back to a couple other things that stood out to me earlier in the book, specifically a story about Alexander the Great\u2019s death. Winegard explained the scholarship around Alexander\u2019s death as coming around to the fact that he died of malaria (a mosquito-borne disease), but my little bit of research turned up that still no one is sure of the cause, and a new study suggests a completely new cause and a date of death six days later than previously thought.\n\nSo this series of issues bothers me for two major reasons: 1) Winegard shows a tendency toward the earth-shattering cynical view that disregards what years of scholarship portray. While this is sometimes healthy and something I even tend toward at times, it becomes dangerous when the breadth of research doesn\u2019t support and you don\u2019t give any source for what you are saying. That means no one can check your facts and they just have to take your word for it. 2) These major factual errors mean it is difficult to believe anything surprising that is said in the 400+ pages of this book. You have to do the work to double-check, as I did many times but not all the time, in order to know if a statement is true or if it is poorly-sourced.\n\nI\u2019ve been wrestling with what to do with The Mosquito for weeks now. I really do think a lot of it is beneficial to an understanding of world history, as Winegard makes very good arguments that the mosquito is much, much more important to an understanding of major conflicts and world historical developments than it is given credit for. However, I cannot overlook the factual errors and misrepresentations within the text. Someone who knows world history better than me could probably find even more, and as a mass-market history book I don\u2019t think most people would see the errors and question some of them. We will probably have people running around saying that the Sons of Liberty didn\u2019t wear Indian garb to the Boston Tea Party, and that is just not true. But they\u2019ll think it is because they read it in a history book from a major publisher. I hope someone else writes this book or there is a second edition after it is read and revised by several historians. But in its current form, I won\u2019t recommend it to my students and I can\u2019t recommend it to you, reader, unless you want to do the work of checking everything that doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\nI\u2019m always a take-the-meat-and-spit-out-the-bones person, but sometimes the danger of getting hurt by the bones of \u201calternative facts\u201d outweighs the benefit of the meat.\n\nI received this book as an eARC courtesy of Penguin Group Dutton and NetGalley, but obviously my opinions are my own.",

He worked six-days per week \u2014 often 12-hour shifts, to give his family \u201cthe best opportunities they could possibly have.\u201d\n\nHeartbreakingly, Jafor\u2019s wife passed away a few years ago from colon cancer, leaving him as a single parent to three children.\n\n\u201cHe was someone who always put his family first,\u201d Mahtab said. \u201cHe worked hard to make sure that his family back in Bangladesh, and here in America, were taken care of.\u201d\n\nHe also believed in the power of education: Mahtab is a sophomore studying history and economics at Harvard University, while his younger sister goes to the Trinity School in New York City.\n\nBy early March, the Covid-19 outbreak began taking hold of the region. Jafor took precautions, such as wearing a mask inside his cab. Soon after, when his son came home from school around March 14th, he stopped driving and socially isolated with his children.\n\nBut a week later, he began to develop mild Covid-19 symptoms: a fever, cough and more. He eventually began experiencing extreme shortness of breath. On March 26th, his family called him an ambulance.\n\nHe was sent to Montefiore Medical Center, where he was put on a ventilator soon after his arrival. Since his condition accelerated so quickly, his family wasn\u2019t able to speak to him. The doctors tried to save him with everything they could: hydroxychloroquine, and a few other medications. None of the treatments worked, and Jafor died on April 1st at the age of 56.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot to take in,\u201d Mahtab said. \u201cIt happened all of a sudden, and it was very unexpected. It\u2019s like: \u2018What happens from here? This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dad worked really hard for everything,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s sad\u2026 he won\u2019t be able to see the fruits of his hard work through the paths of me, my brother and my sister.\u201d",

        "title": "Creativity Lies Behind Leisure, Not Working",
        "text": "Every human being has a unique creativity, though at different levels. This creativity emerges under the right conditions. We think that one of the most important of these conditions is financial opportunities and a comfortable life.\n\nYes, a person must have the time to allocate the things he has set up in his mind and the resources to allocate them if he has time. On the other hand, we know that people from different parts of the world, despite the limited opportunities at their disposal, create creative works within these opportunities. This would be sometimes a statue, sometimes a car prototype, sometimes a book.\n\nCreativity, by its very nature, means this. Nobody has unlimited possibilities, only some have more, and these are undoubtedly more advantageous. However, revealing something from scratch is, from this point of view, using the available resources to produce something that has never created before.\n\nIf we have understood that each of us has a certain amount of opportunities in our hands, and it is possible to make something out of them, let us look at the second important key point to produce something. This is working, as we can all imagine.\n\nIt is not possible to produce something that does not exist, without spending a lot of time on it, without labor and thinking. The people we call creative are undoubtedly people who devote a lot of time to their work. But if you think working hard and constantly supporting what you want to do, you\u2019re wrong.\n\nThe most important way to increase your creative ability is to create free time and engage in other things. Although this may seem contradictory, the more we evaluate the act of \u2018creating\u2019, the more easily we will understand why this is so.\n\nFirst, we constantly learn something in the field we have focused on, trying to find out something, drown in details; this means that we should close ourselves to any new information that may come from outside within this time frame. Although it is very important to shut yourself out while you are concentrating on a task, the longer it takes, the more naturally the number of new things entering our brains decreases significantly.\n\nBeing creative means being as open to new things as possible. The greater and more diverse the number of information and data entering the brain, the greater the potential of the brain to recognize, process and produce something.\n\nBesides, our experiences, what we see and meet outside, whether we are aware or not, add new things to us. The story outside feeds the story \u2018inside\u2019.\n\nSecond, our brains make a serious effort when working intensively or learning something. And like any muscle group, the brain needs rest to improve itself. You can\u2019t go to the gym every day and train for hours, because the body doesn\u2019t have time to provide the necessary nutrients and supplements, due to the work out the muscles . Similarly, each information entering the brain is a new neuron and the information set is a neuron network.\n\nThe brain needs free time to process, make sense of, and regulate these neurons in a healthy way. On the one hand, he can\u2019t learn or do something intensely while thinking about something, because what he can do in a single moment is limited.\n\nIn other words, if you increase your mental capacity on the one hand and give your mind a free time to evaluate them on the other, it offers you new information and experiences in return for what you have not done before, or what can be put forward in the context of \u2018creating\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019ve all experienced it. When an idea comes to mind, it is not when we think the most, but when we think the least or never think. Because in such a timeframe, our brain processes the data and information at its best without any pressure.\n\nThe important thing is to keep the balance between the time you spend to produce something and the time you can define as \u2018leisure\u2019, even if this time makes no sense to you.",

        "text": "Thought Plagiarism and How It Threatens Creative Platforms\n\nWhen does copying end and the destruction of ideas begin?\n\nPhoto by Vinicius Amano on Unsplash\n\nEvery platform has its self-seekers \u2014 that is, those who try to game the system by milking the creativity of others and doing as little as possible on their end. Money and fame are usually the motivating factors for this.\n\nThey are the mimickers, the copiers, the type that \u2018steal\u2019 an idea and rework it in a way that rides on the coattails of the originator. They don\u2019t care about attribution. They don\u2019t wait and give the content distance in time. They\u2019ll cash in as quickly and as frequently as possible. This is because to them, the internet is all about free speech.\n\nSometimes, they\u2019ll go as far as calling it working smarter and not harder \u2014 except, the reality is that it\u2019s leaning toward a black hat attempt to get as much money and attention as possible without adding value to the platform that\u2019s paying them.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about those moments of mind-melding experiences where two creators happen to have the exact same idea or thought wave around the same time. It happens. Those moments are often done in isolation and innocence, making the similarities forgivable.\n\nThe difference between innocent creators and self-seekers is that the latter will exhibit an identifiable trend. They don\u2019t just have one-offs \u2014 they have a history of content that seems too alike to be coincidental.\n\nWhen enough people do this with money and fame as the main motivator, they drown out the original voices and contribute to the image of sameness on a platform.",

But with the hard times we are all going through during this pandemic, I felt that giving a cookie-cutter solution to very personal problems wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nToday, I just want to draw attention to what has been my process over the last six months to dealing with negative emotions while I\u2019m sitting in front of a computer trying to code.\n\nBecause you see, dealing with bad feelings and anxiety is different when you\u2019re not working. You can find something to soothe you easily, like getting distracted by a movie or just laying down and letting your thoughts go.\n\nBut my boss doesn\u2019t like that and doesn\u2019t pay me to watch movies. They pay me to be productive, to make their problems my own for 40 hours a week. So I have to deal with that as a professional would.\n\nCoding is not something that you can afford to do while being distracted. You must always have your next step in mind, thinking about a thousand different best practices to apply at the same time. It\u2019s a very mind-egoistic practice because you can\u2019t let your brain wander around anywhere else except the editor.\n\nHere is a list of methods I used as my first-aid kit during these tough times.

        "title": "How to Scale Python on Every Major Cloud Provider",
        "text": "How to Scale Python on Every Major Cloud Provider\n\nBest practices for cloud computing with Python\n\nIn the words of Pywren creator Eric Jonas, \u201cThe cloud is too damn hard!\u201d\n\nPython in the cloud.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve developed a Python application on your laptop and want to scale it up in the cloud (perhaps with more data or more GPUs), the next steps are unclear, and unless you have an infrastructure team that\u2019s already set it up for you, \u201cJust use Kubernetes\u201d is not so simple.\n\nSo you\u2019ll choose one of AWS, GCP, and Azure and navigate over to the management console to sift through instance types, security groups, spot prices, availability zones, instance limits, and so on. Once you\u2019ve got all of that sorted out and managed to rent some virtual machines, you\u2019ve still got to figure out how to actually run your application on them. How exactly does my Python script divide up the work across a 10 machine cluster? At this point, you may try to rewrite your application using PySpark or mpi4py or Celery.\n\nIf that fails you\u2019ll build a brand new distributed system like Uber and Lyft recently did with Fiber and Flyte. In either case, you\u2019re either rewriting your application, building a new distributed system, or both. All to speed up your Python script in the cloud.\n\nWe\u2019re going to walk through how to use Ray to launch clusters and scale Python on any of these cloud providers with just a few commands.\n\nHere it is in a diagram. Step 1 is to develop your Python application. This usually happens on your laptop, but you can do it in the cloud if you prefer. Step 2 is to launch a cluster on your cloud provider of choice. Step 3 is to run your application wherever you want (your laptop or in the cloud).\n\nScale your Python application on any cloud provider with three steps. Step 1: develop your application locally (or in the cloud if you prefer). Step 2: launch a cluster on your cloud provider of choice. Step 3: run your application on the cluster!\n\nSetup\n\nFirst, install some Python dependencies.\n\npip install -U ray \\\n\nboto3 \\\n\nazure-cli \\\n\nazure-core \\\n\ngoogle-api-python-client\n\nNext, configure credentials for the cloud provider of your choice. You can skip this step if you\u2019re already set up to use your cloud provider from the command line.\n\nAWS: Configure your credentials in ~/.aws/credentials as described in the boto docs.\n\nConfigure your credentials in as described in the boto docs. Azure: Log in using az login , then configure your credentials with az account set -s <subscription_id> .\n\nLog in using , then configure your credentials with . GCP: Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable as described in docs.\n\nThe Ray cluster launcher uses a config file that looks something like this\n\nA minimal cluster config file for use with the Ray cluster launcher.\n\nHere you can specify everything including setup commands to run, instance types to use, files to rsync, autoscaling strategies, and so on.\n\nFetch a slightly more complete example with additional configurable fields as follows.\n\n# AWS\n\nwget\n\n# Azure\n\nwget\n\n# GCP\n\nwget wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/dafd4c6bd26fe4599dc3c6b05e80789188b3e2e5/aws-config.yaml wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/dafd4c6bd26fe4599dc3c6b05e80789188b3e2e5/azure-config.yaml wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/1846cbf971d1cd708b3d29d9ae50ad882fbaac50/gcp-config.yaml\n\nYou\u2019ll need to make a few minor modifications to the above config files:\n\nAzure: Replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub with the appropriate key files.\n\nReplace and with the appropriate key files. GCP: Set the appropriate project_id .\n\nStep 1: Create a Python Application\n\nDefine a simple Python script that we want to scale up.\n\nA simple Python application that can run on your laptop or in the cloud and tracks the IP addresses of the machines that its tasks are executed on. This script uses Ray to parallelize the computation.\n\nYou can run the example (actually a slightly more complete one) as follows.\n\n# Fetch the example.\n\nwget wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robertnishihara/a9ce1d0d434cd52dd9b07eb57f4c3476/raw/4313660c0bd40f8bd909f70c1e0abc4be8584198/script.py # Run the script.\n\npython script.py\n\nYou\u2019ll see the following output.\n\nThis cluster consists of\n\n1 nodes in total\n\n16.0 CPU resources in total Tasks executed\n\n10000 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX\n\nNow run the same script on a Ray cluster. These instructions are for AWS. To use Azure or GCP, simple replace aws-config.yaml with either azure-config.yaml or gcp-config.yaml in both lines.\n\nStep 2: Start the Cluster\n\n# AWS\n\nray up -y aws-config.yaml\n\n# Azure\n\nray up -y azure-config.yaml\n\n# GCP\n\nray up -y gcp-config.yaml\n\nStep 3: Run the Script on the Cluster\n\n# AWS\n\nray submit aws-config.yaml script.py\n\n# Azure\n\nray submit azure-config.yaml script.py\n\n# GCP\n\nray submit gcp-config.yaml script.py\n\nYou\u2019ll see the following output.\n\nThis cluster consists of\n\n3 nodes in total\n\n6.0 CPU resources in total Tasks executed\n\n3561 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX\n\n2685 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX\n\n3754 tasks on XXX.XXX.X.XXX\n\nIf it says there is only 1 node, then you may need to wait a little longer for the other nodes to start up.\n\nIn this case, the 10,000 tasks were run across three machines.\n\nYou can also connect to the cluster and poke around with one of the following commands.\n\n# Connect to the cluster (via ssh). # AWS\n\nray attach aws-config.yaml\n\n# Azure\n\nray attach azure-config.yaml\n\n# GCP\n\nray attach gcp-config.yaml\n\nShutdown the Cluster\n\nDon\u2019t forget to shutdown your cluster when you\u2019re done!\n\n# AWS\n\nray down -y aws-config.yaml\n\n# Azure\n\nray down -y azure-config.yaml\n\n# GCP\n\nray down -y gcp-config.yaml\n\nFurther Details\n\nWant to add support for a new cloud provider? Just extend the NodeProvider class, which usually takes 200\u2013300 lines of code. Take a look at the implementation for AWS.",

        "title": "The Secret Behind Successful Performers \u2014 The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle",
        "text": "Introduction: The Girl Who Did a Month\u2019s Worth of Practice in Six Minutes\n\nCoyle begins by introducing talent hotbeds, places that regularly produce top performers, then talking about a girl named Clarissa, studied by Australian music psychologists Gary McPherson and James Renwick, who watched her make \u201ca month\u2019s worth of progress in 6 minutes\u201d when she actually buckled down and concentrated.\n\n\u201cLook at that!\u2026She\u2019s got a blueprint in her mind she\u2019s constantly comparing herself to. She\u2019s working in phrases, complete thoughts. She\u2019s not ignoring errors, she\u2019s hearing them, fixing them. She\u2019s fitting small parts into the whole, drawing the lens in and out all the time, scaffolding herself to a higher level.\u201d \u2014 McPherson, commenting on the Clarissa video.\n\nMost of the time, though, Clarissa\u2019s practice is about her not thinking, not learning, not building, and just wasting time.\n\nCoyle says myelin is the \u201choly grail of acquiring skill,\u201d which grows through practice.\n\nPART 1 \u2014 DEEP PRACTICE\n\nChapter 1 The Sweet Spot\n\n\u201cFor half of that time, being in a talent hotbed felt like standing amid a herd of running deer: everything moved faster and more fluently than in everyday life\u2026But that was only half the time. During the other half I witnessed something very different: moments of slow, fitful struggle, rather like what I\u2019d seen on the Clarissa video.\u201d\n\nMaking progress: small failures, a shared facial expression of taut/intense squint.\n\nWhen learners try a move, they fail, then stop and think, do it again more slowly, fail again, stops to think again, does it more slowly, break the move down to component parts.\n\nActive retrieval versus passive reception of info makes you engrave things into memory.\n\nStruggling at the edges of your ability makes you smarter. Experiences that force you to slow down, make errors, and correct them, make you \u201cswift and graceful without your realizing it.\u201d\n\nEffortlessness is good for performance, not for learning.\n\nThe more we generate brain impulses through overcoming difficulties, the more scaffolding we build and the faster we learn. Turn mistakes into skills.\n\nHenry Roediger, Wash U of St Louis: history students were split in 2 groups. 1st group studied 4x, second group studied 1x, tested 3x, 2nd group performed 50% better.\n\nThey\u2019d studied one-fourth as much yet learned far more.\n\nThe more our brains generate impulses by overcoming difficulties, the more scaffolding they build, and the faster we learn.\n\nStory: Edwin Link created the first pilot trainers by building sample planes.\n\nHow are Brazilian soccer players so good?\n\nPlayers log 20 hrs a week of practice (as opposed to British 5 hours) and play futebol de salao (futsal), using a ball half the size and twice the weight of the real thing, that didn\u2019t bounce, in a basketball-court sized concrete/wood/dirt field with teams of 5\u20136, not 11. It\u2019s all about quick, nonstop, controlled action.\n\nWhy it works: Futsal players touch the ball 600% more often than soccer players, the smaller, heavier ball is harder to handle \u2014 you must be precise. It makes actual soccer easier.\n\nGood advertising also uses these ideas to put viewers at the \u201csweet spot\u201d of their abilities. For example, a whisky ad \u201cingle ells\u2026ingle ells\u2026the holidays aren\u2019t the same without J&B\u201d\n\nChapter 2 The Deep Practice Cell\n\nDeep practice is a powerful idea because it seems magical. Clarissa begins as an average musician and, in six minutes, accomplishes a month\u2019s worth of work.\n\nThe more you fire a circuit, the more that circuit is myelinated, and gets stronger and the more fluent your thoughts/mvts become. These circuits (NOT your muscles) control everything.\n\nAutomaticity: The more we develop these circuits, the more automatic our skills are, the less aware we\u2019re using the circuits. The more we feel that a skill is natural, something we\u2019ve always had.\n\nWe\u2019re forever building vast, intricate circuits, and we\u2019re simultaneously forgetting that we built them.\n\nMyelin makes up more than half your brain\u2019s mass.\n\nBill Greenough 1980s experiment showed that rats in an enriched environment had increased brain synapses by 25% and also white matter/myelin.\n\nGreenough helped establish the concepts of brain plasticity and developmental windows.\n\nResearchers started linking myelin deficiencies to dyslexia, autism, ADD, PTSD, etc.\n\nFredrik Ullen 2005: found a directly proportional relationship between hours of practice and white matter.\n\nMyelin can regulate speed, and timing is imperative because neurons are binary, they either fire or not. If 2 neurons have to combine their impulses to make another one fire, they have to arrive at the exact same time.\n\nYour brain has so many connections and possibilities that your genes can\u2019t code the neurons to time things so precisely\u2026But you can build myelin to do it. \u2014 Dr. Fields\n\nMyelination is slow. It wraps 40\u201350 times, taking days to weeks per neuron. Fields: \u201cIt\u2019s [myelinating thousands of nerves is] like insulating a transatlantic cable\u201d\n\nStruggle is not optional \u2014 it\u2019s neurologically required\n\nYou have to fire the circuit suboptimally, make mistakes, pay attention, teach your circuit.\n\nDeep practice is helped by a \u201cprimal state\u201d where you\u2019re attentive, hungry, focused, desperate.\n\nMyelin wraps, doesn\u2019t unwrap.\n\nMyelin comes in waves, up into our 30s during critical periods, and we will gain myelin until 50, when you start to lose it, but even then 5% of oligodendrocytes stay ready to learn. That\u2019s why most world-class experts start young.\n\nIn the 1970s, the cognitive revolution was starting. People believed that the mind works like a computer and obeys universal rules. In 1976, Anders Ericsson worked on a dissertation on verbal reports (people\u2019s accounts of their mental states).\n\nHe caught the attention of Herbert Simon, Nobel Prize-winning economist who brought him to the US.\n\nEvery skill is a form of memory.\n\nDeliberate practice: Work on technique, seek constant critical feedback, ruthlessly shore up weaknesses.\n\nALL skills are built with the same underlying mechanisms.\n\nMichael Howe estimates that Mozart had studied 3,500 hours of music by age 6.\n\nThe rage to master: Ellen Winner\u2019s term for people with an innate, obsessive desire to improve.\n\nChapter 3 The Brontes, the Z-Boys, and the Renaissance\n\nBiographer Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s story of the Bronte sisters\u2019 romantic creativity is not true. Rather, according to Juliet Barker, the Brontes lived in a home full of stimulating ideas, often imitated articles and books.\n\n[The Brontes] wrote a great deal in a variety of forms \u2014 twenty-two little books averaging eighty pages each in one fifteen month period \u2014 and\u2026their writing, while complicated and fantastical, wasn\u2019t very good.\n\nThe Bronte\u2019s early, unskilled writing is a prerequisite to their eventual literary success. They had to spend massive amounts of time being immature and imitative in the \u201csafe space of their little books.\u201d\n\nThey were practicing collaboratively.\n\nTo write a book, even a tiny one, is to play a particular kind of game.\n\nEach one of the Bronte\u2019s little books were terrible, except, each \u201cmade them happy, and each one quietly earned them a bit of skill.\u201d\n\nDavid Banks shows that geniuses tend to appear in clusters:\n\nAthens, 440\u2013380 BC\n\nFlorence, 1440\u20131490\n\nLondon, 1570\u20131640\n\nWhy? People predicted: prosperity, peace, freedom, social mobility, new paradigms/perspectives.\n\nBut those predictions aren\u2019t true.\n\nTurns out, Florence saw geniuses emerge from the rise of craft guilds, based on the apprenticeship system, where young kids age 7 or so would live with a master for 5\u201310 years and learn.\n\nIf people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all. \u2014 Michelangelo\n\nMonkeys have all the same neurons and neurotransmitters as us, but they have 20% less myelin, and they can\u2019t talk beyond the level of a 3 year old.\n\nThis is also why breast fed babies have more IQ \u2014 there\u2019s more myelin building blocks in breast milk.\n\nSame with the reason why eating fish with fatty acids is good for preventing memory loss.\n\nBut building myelin is biologically expensive.\n\nIn the space of a generation, or a few hundred miles, certain higher skills flip from being crucial to being trivial and vice versa.\n\nOur genes matter, but\n\nWe have a good deal of control over what skills we develop, and we each have more potential than we might ever presume to guess.\n\nChapter 4 The Three Rules of Deep Practice\n\nHSE: the Holy Shit Effect. The feeling of seeing talent blooming in folks just like you.\n\nAdriaan de Groot, Dutch psychologist, discovered that chess masters memorized boards via chunking.\n\nEach group of chunks (discrete small circuits) nests inside other groups like Russian dolls. Reading is all about chunking at lightning speed.\n\nDeep practice feels a bit like exploring a dark and unfamiliar room. You start slowly, you bump into furniture, stop, think, and start again.\n\nRules for myelination/learning:\n\nChunk it up: Look at the task as a whole (Spend time staring at/listening to the task in its totality, as a single coherent entity, listen to the song you want to play over and over. Absorb the picture of the skill, imagine yourself doing it) We\u2019re pre-wired to imitate. Then break it into its smallest chunks. Then play it slow, then speed it up (to learn inner architecture) Slow it down Repeat it Learn to feel it: to avoid mistakes, you have to feel them immediately\n\nRay LaMontagne taught himself to be a singer-songwriter at age 22 by buying dozens of used albums by people like Etta James, Ray Charles, Al Green, Stephen Stills, and spending 2 years singing along to the records, ignoring everyone else. 8 years later, his first album sold nearly half a million copies.\n\nImitatsiya: Spartak (Larisa Preobrazhenskaya\u2019s Russian tennis training center) term for rallying in slow motion with an imaginary ball. Students work on slow, simple, precise motions with an emphasis on technique. No one is allowed to play a tournament for the first 3 years.\n\nIf you begin playing without technique, it is big mistake. Big, big mistake! \u2014 Preobrazhenskaya\n\nIvan Galamian chose upstate NY to create Meadowmount music academy. In 7 weeks, students learn a years\u2019 worth of material, 5x as much as anyone else.\n\nThe teachers cut music into strips, stuff it in envelopes, and pull chunks out randomly.\n\nThey cut the strips into smaller fragments by changing the rhythms. The goal? Break a skill into component pieces/circuits, memorize those pieces individually, link them into progressively larger groups (interconnect circuits)\n\nOne teacher\u2019s rule of thumb: If a passerby can recognize the song being played, you\u2019re not practicing right. Go 3\u20135x slower than ever. If you do this for 3 hours with one page of music, you can accomplish 1\u20132 weeks\u2019 worth of shallow practice.\n\nGoing slow lets you pay more attention to errors and get more precise with your neuronal firing, which is everything.\n\nIt\u2019s not how fast you can do it. It\u2019s how slow you can do it correctly. \u2014 Tom Martinez, football coach\n\nBarry Zimmerman studies how people coach themselves, self-regulation. (How they observe, judge, strategize, set goals, plan, self-monitor, adapt)\n\nExperts think in terms of chunks, building up into a private skill language.\n\n\u201cWhen I click in, every note is being played for a purpose. It feels like I\u2019m building a house\u2026I connect them and get a foundation. Then I add the walls, connect those. then the roof, then the paint. Then, hopefully, it all hangs together.\u201d \u2014 John Henry Crawford, Meadowmount student\n\nThere isn\u2019t a substitute for attentive repetition. Action. Not talking, thinking, imagining, or reading.\n\nTo start losing skill, stop practicing for 30 days. Myelin will break down.\n\nIf I skip practice for one day, I notice. If I skip practice for two days, my wife notices. If I skip for three days, the world notices. \u2014 Vladimir Horowitz\n\nThere\u2019s a universal limit to how much deep practice people can do in a day. 3\u20135 hours max, for all skills.\n\nAt Meadowmount, Skye Carmen taught students:\n\nAthletes don\u2019t fool around when they practice. Musicians are athletes too. Tune your instrument, then tune your ear. You have to feel mistakes coming. Hearing a string out of tune should bother you a LOT.\n\nThe deep practice cycle:\n\nPick Target Reach for Target Evaluate Gap between Target and Reach Repeat\n\nBabies learning to walk stagger around: To get good, it\u2019s helpful to be willing, even enthusiastic, about being bad.\n\nBaby steps are the royal road to skill.\n\nW Timothy Gallwey taught beginner students without speech: He just showed them how to hit.\n\nI am slow to learn and slow to forget what I have learned \u2014 Abraham Lincoln\n\nDeliberate practice is NOT natural, effortless, routine, automatic, or genius.",

        "text": "0. Networking\n\nThe definition of the actual ECS cluster does not have any networking requirements.\n\nresource \"aws_ecs_cluster\" \"cluster\" {\n\nname = \"${var.environment}-cluster\"\n\ntags = var.tags\n\n}\n\nThis is because the networking features are defined at the service level as these are the elastic components that host the tasks.\n\nECS overview\n\nOur network requirements are specified in the service definition:\n\nresource \"aws_ecs_service\" \"fargate-microservices\" {\n\nfor_each = var.create_microservices == true ? var.fargate_microservices : {}\n\nname = each.value[\"name\"]\n\ncluster = aws_ecs_cluster.cluster.id\n\ndesired_count = each.value[\"desired_count\"]\n\nlaunch_type = each.value[\"launch_type\"]\n\ndepends_on = [aws_ecs_cluster.cluster,\n\naws_ecs_task_definition.ecs_tasks]\n\ntask_definition = each.value[\"task_definition\"]\n\n\n\nnetwork_configuration {\n\nsubnets = var.ecs_service_subnets\n\nsecurity_groups = [aws_security_group.ecs_security_groups[each.value[\"security_group_mapping\"]].id]\n\n}\n\n\n\nlifecycle {\n\nignore_changes = [\n\ntask_definition\n\n]\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, I\u2019m going to start by focusing on the network configuration.\n\nnetwork_configuration {\n\nsubnets = var.ecs_service_subnets\n\nsecurity_groups = [aws_security_group.ecs_security_groups[each.value[\"security_group_mapping\"]].id]\n\n}\n\nIn this instance, the (private) subnets are inherited from a module which defines our VPC, when creating the dynamic cluster we simply reference our list of subnets in the VPC module in order to build the services into our desired VPC.\n\nThe security groups make use of the \u2018for_each\u2019 function in Terraform that underpins a lot of the mechanics of this module.\n\nThis functionality allows us to build out multiple resources that share the same arguments. The module simply requires for_each to be defined within the resource and then a \u2018map\u2019 variable to be passed into the specified argument.\n\nfor_each = var.create_microservices == true ? var.fargate_microservices : {}\n\nIn this case, we\u2019ve specified that create_microservices must be true in order to create our services. Then the fargate_microservices variable is a map that contains all arguments required for our service (an example can be found in the \u2018dynamic services\u2019 chapter).\n\nNow that we understand the for_each loop, here is the code within the module which allows you to define an arbitrary amount of security groups.\n\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"ecs_security_groups\" {\n\nvpc_id = var.vpc_id\n\n\n\nfor_each = var.security_groups\n\nname = \"${var.environment}-${each.value[\"ingress_port\"]}\"\n\n\n\ningress {\n\nfrom_port = each.value[\"ingress_port\"]\n\nto_port = each.value[\"ingress_port\"]\n\nprotocol = each.value[\"ingress_protocol\"]\n\ncidr_blocks = each.value[\"ingress_cidr_blocks\"]\n\n}\n\n\n\negress {\n\nfrom_port = each.value[\"egress_port\"]\n\nto_port = each.value[\"egress_port\"]\n\nprotocol = each.value[\"egress_protocol\"]\n\ncidr_blocks = each.value[\"egress_cidr_blocks\"]\n\n}\n\n\n\ntags = var.tags\n\n}\n\nThis resource block will iterate over your \u2018var.security_groups\u2019 object which is defined outside of the module and will pick up a variable for each variable that is prefixed with \u2018each.value\u2019.\n\nThis is how you define a single security group outside of the module:\n\n\"ecs_security_groups\": {\n\n\"prod-ecs-sg\": {\n\n\"ingress_port\": \"redacted\",\n\n\"ingress_protocol\": \"redacted\",\n\n\"ingress_cidr_blocks\": [\n\n\"redacted\"\n\n],\n\n\"egress_port\": \"redacted\",\n\n\"egress_protocol\": \"redacted\",\n\n\"egress_cidr_blocks\": [\n\n\"redacted\"\n\n]\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThese are then mapped to their respective services using the \u2018security_group_mapping\u2019 variable inside the service, the variable matches the id of this security group (prod-ecs-sg) to the specified service. From here it is simple to add another security group by appending this map object.\n\nNow we\u2019ll revisit the service definition to see how the security_group_mapping variable is used in conjunction with the other dynamic variables.",

        "text": "They thought we\u2019d be there in 1978. Forty years later, we are there.\n\nOr there\u2019s this vision. Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) moves through a rose-tinted world in the movie Her. By day, he works for a company that writes letters for people who can\u2019t emotionally muster it \u2014 himself an A.I. for people\u2019s emotional worlds. He is dating Samantha, his intelligent operating system. Theodore moves through an urban world, having deeply connected conversations with Samantha yet remaining disconnected from the people around him. He is attuned to a voice that only he can hear, but who can be the same voice for thousands of others at the same time. Is he affected by the strange virtuality of his love, or avoiding the difficulties of relating to a real person, or both? The movie world of Her is color-corrected like gauzy Instagram photos of Coachella fans, an interface of image in which nothing is not a computer.\n\nHow do you communicate what you don\u2019t understand?\n\nThe problem is that it\u2019s hard to communicate clearly about A.I. \u2014 in part because communicating about it means understanding it. And most of us don\u2019t have a clear understanding of what A.I. actually is. The term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d has been around since 1955, when A.I. pioneer John McCarthy wrote that A.I. was a matter of \u201cmaking machines do things that would require intelligence if done by man.\u201d That idea hasn\u2019t changed much today \u2014 Wikipedia contrasts artificial intelligence (or machine intelligence) with the natural intelligence of humans and animals, and the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as \u201cthe capacity of computers or other machines to exhibit or simulate intelligent behaviour; the field of study concerned with this. Abbreviated A.I.\u201d But what does that actually mean to an everyday person? Does it mean chatbots passing a Turing Test? A robot uprising? Or is it simply interactivity where the processing happens just out of sight?\n\nA.I. is a black box, \u201ca device which performs intricate functions but whose internal mechanism may not readily be inspected or understood\u201d (OED)\u2014something we understand because of the inputs and the outputs. We can\u2019t see what happens inside and we\u2019re not meant to have access to it. The black box is opaque.\n\nToday, there are three reasons for algorithmic opacity, as Jenna Burrell writes: the need to protect algorithms that are state or corporate secrets; the fact that A.I.-related coding is still the territory of specialists; and a \u201cmismatch\u201d between the mathematical ways algorithms process information and the way humans think. This last one is the hardest to sort out: how humans think is different than how the machine thinks, and how we reason is different than how the machine reasons (or doesn\u2019t reason, depending on your definition of \u201creason\u201d).\n\nThe European Union is requiring that A.I. be made explainable through a \u201cright to explanation\u201d as part of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) that just took effect. EU citizens have a right to an explanation for the work of algorithms, and they have a right to request human intervention. The regulations support the idea that \u201cpeople are owed agency and understanding when they\u2019re faced by machine-made decisions,\u201d Cliff Kuang wrote in the New York Times. David Weinberger argues that rather than explaining itself, one focus of A.I. should be optimization, not explanation: make visible and clear to all through debate in public policy what trade-offs are being made, rather than potentially hobbling A.I.\n\nThe US government has never been known for well-designed PowerPoint decks\n\nIn the meantime, DARPA has introduced the Explainable Artificial Intelligence program, which seeks to make the models behind machine learning and A.I. more explainable. It\u2019s an important move toward understanding what we mean when we talk about A.I., and yet I wonder what it will actually achieve for everyday people. The DARPA page for the project serves up this image showing what a user might be asking, but not in any quick way that\u2019s going affect how it shows up in the world. Perhaps not surprisingly, DARPA returns to the same clich\u00e9s as the Google Image Searches I mentioned above.",

        "text": "Microplastic Pollutes the Fruits and Vegetables We Eat\n\nFor the first time, microplastic was detected in fruits and vegetables by the scientist Margherita Ferrante and her team from the University of Catania in Italy. The existence of microplastic is evident in lettuce, carrots, broccoli, potatoes, apples, and pears.\n\nThe researchers found plastic participles are more concentrated in fruits than in vegetables. Fruits contain more microplastic due to their greater size and the age of the tree. Microplastic accumulates during the life of the tree. Another reason is the bigger root system of fruit trees compared to vegetables.\n\nApples show the highest amount of pollution for fruits and carrots for vegetables. The number of microplastic found in fruits and vegetables is still lower than in water from a plastic bottle.\n\nA second peer-reviewed study, a joint project between the Leiden University in the Netherlands and the Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research in China, shows plastic is sucked up by the roots of food crops. Professor Peijnenburg from Leiden University explains that the roots of lettuce and wheat absorb plastic and transport it to the edible part of the plant.\n\nUntil now researchers didn\u2019t believe that plastic can pass through the intact barriers of plant tissue. These findings raise serious concerns about the safety of the food we eat.\n\n\u201cFor years we have known about plastic in crustaceans and fish, but this is the first time we have known about plastic getting into vegetables. \u201cIf it is getting into vegetables, it is getting into everything that eats vegetables as well which means it is in our meat and dairy as well. \u2014 Maria Westerbos, Founder of Plastic Soup Foundation\n\nResearchers and environmental campaigners call for an urgent investigation. And we as consumers should too. Is the food we feed our children safe? Or have we destructed our planet so much that there is no safe food available anymore?",

With the stock up 30% year over year, it\u2019s clear that this mobile advertising juggernaut is transforming the ad industry. At BBDO, we have embraced the rise of Facebook by launching Project Thumb Breaker \u2014 an initiative that is fueling BBDO\u2019s ambition to become the most effective creator of Facebook ads in the world.\n\nWhile Facebook has transformed the ad industry, legacy brands have been disrupted by upstarts. The direct-to-consumer model combined with excellent customer service and smart branding has enabled Casper, Harry\u2019s and many others to generate billions of dollars in revenue in less than a few years. Unilever\u2019s acquisition of Dollar Shave Club demonstrates how disruptive this model can be\u2026 Unilever clearly intends to challenge P&G\u2019s dominant brand Gillette.\n\nFacebook advertising is a strong driver for brand growth. However, it\u2019s a channel that works best as part of a broader ecosystem. Research has proven that integrated campaigns that leverage a range of channels drive stronger business results.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Harry\u2019s and Casper have embraced the value of integrated campaign development \u2014 they don\u2019t rely on Facebook, Google or any one individual channel. I ride the New York subway to work everyday. More and more, the OOH subway ads I see are from startup brands like Talkspace, Casper and Harry\u2019s. And you know what\u2026 the ads work. If I am stressed out from a long challenging week, the Talkspace ad telling me that their app can pair me with a therapist instantly for $32/week is pretty effective. If I am tired and don\u2019t really want to cook or go out, the Seamless ad makes me far more likely to order in. If I just moved or am not sleeping well, the Casper ad definitely encourages me to buy a new mattress. And if I am on the way to work after just getting ready, the Harry\u2019s ad definitely makes me feel that Harry\u2019s great design and style could make the start to my day just a little bit smoother.\n\nBrilliant OOH ad from Talkspace. Note the social norming strategy that makes the app look popular and effective.\n\nSo, we should listen when Time Warner says that 95% of video consumption happens on TV and that Facebook video on its own would rank as the #158th most watched show. And we should listen when Facebook says it has 1.03B daily active mobile users. No individual media channel can become the golden bullet for a campaign. Marketers who want to create the most effective work need to leverage communications planning to integrate all of their advertising across all channels. Strong communications planning generates a multiplier effect on the impact of advertising. All channels, from print to OOH to TV to Facebook, are pillars of strong campaign ecosystems.",

        "title": "Empower a Lightweight Python Data Structure: From Tuples to Namedtuples",
        "text": "Tuple\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with related data elements, one of the most commonly used data types is the tuple. As an immutable data type, tuples are sequences of data with a fixed size. They\u2019re useful to group related data with different data types. Consider the following trivial example.\n\n>>> employee0 = ('John Smith', 45, 'M', 160083)\n\nIn the above code snippet, we define a tuple called employee0 , which stores an employee\u2019s personal data, including name, age, gender, and employee ID number. If we need to use some elements of the tuple, we can unpack it or use subscript, and their usages are shown below.\n\n>>> # Use unpacking\n\n>>> name, age, gender, employee_id = employee0\n\n>>> print(f\"Employee Name: {name}\")\n\nEmployee Name: John Smith\n\n>>>\n\n>>> # Use subscript\n\n>>> print(f\"Employee Age: {employee0[1]}\")\n\nEmployee Age: 45\n\n>>> print(f\"Employee ID #: {employee0[-1]}\")\n\nEmployee ID #: 160083\n\nHow about we need to deal with another employee in the same module? We\u2019ll have to do something like below.\n\n>>> # Create a tuple for storing another employee data\n\n>>> employee1 = ('Jennifer Brown', 38, 'F', 150384)\n\n>>>\n\n>>> # Access data\n\n>>> name1, age1, gender1, employee_id1 = employee1\n\n>>> print(f\"Employee Name: {employee1[0]}\")\n\nEmployee Name: Jennifer Brown\n\n>>> print(f\"Employee Age: {age1}\")\n\nEmployee Age: 38\n\n>>> print(f\"Employee ID #: {employee_id1}\")\n\nEmployee ID #: 150384\n\nIn essence, we have to repeat the above steps, and access individual elements using either unpacking or subscripts, which certainly is not the most pleasant thing to do. Actually, it can be error-prone because you have to remember the exact order of these data.",

        "title": "How to Age Effectively \u2014 Tips for Longevity",
        "text": "How do you approach aging? Do you greet each birthday with a smile? Are you afraid of becoming a senior citizen? Maybe you don\u2019t think about it at all. Old age is a long way off.\n\nNo matter how old you are, it\u2019s never too early to start preparing for your future. In this article, we\u2019ll review some simple ways to keep you healthy as you age. We\u2019ll also discover that you don\u2019t need to be afraid of getting older. In many ways, the best is yet to come.\n\nHow Smiling Can Keep You Alive\n\nWe\u2019re going to start with an easy one.\n\nA genuine smile can light up the room. It can also help you stay healthy in old age.\n\nIn Better With Age, Alan Castel discusses a study where researchers reviewed old baseball cards. They then divided the players into three categories:\n\nThe researchers then went back to see how long each of the players lived. The men who had no smiles lived to be an average of 72 years old. The half smilers made it to 75. The players with full, genuine smiles lived to be 80.\n\nOf course, smiling might not cause a longer life, but expressing happiness and having a positive attitude are correlated with longevity.\n\nHow Physical Exercise Trains Your Body and Your Mind\n\nThere are few activities more important than physical exercise. Getting the blood flowing can help prevent a wide range of diseases, keep you at a healthy weight, and reduce stress.\n\nStarting at around 50 years old, a part of the brain called the hippocampus starts to shrink. The hippocampus\u2019s main job is to help with memory formation. A declining hippocampus is also associated with declining executive function and depression.\n\nWalking just three times a day can help prevent mental decline. For bonus points, walk with someone else and make it social!\n\nIn one study, one group of elderly adults was assigned to walk 40 minutes, three days a week. After one year, their hippocampi grew by 2%. Both control groups (one assigned to stretching and one assigned to non-activity) each had hippocampi that shrunk by 1%.\n\nIt appears that cardiovascular exercise can help stop or even reverse age-related mental decline.\n\nIn The Brain That Changes Itself, Norman Doidge explains how physical exercise can help jumpstart neurogenesis-the creation of new neurons. The brain\u2019s ability to adapt to new situations- neuroplasticity -is also linked with cardiovascular exercise.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be running marathons to get the benefits. As seen in the study above, even a walk outside can make a big difference.\n\nIf You Want to Stay Sharp, Never Stop Learning\n\nWhen we grow up, we\u2019re faced with new situations all the time. New material in school. Evolving social structures. Learning the ropes when we start our careers.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re not careful, you can get complacent. While it can be comfortable to coast once you\u2019ve settled into life, it\u2019s not good for your health.\n\nIn The Brain That Changes Itself, Doidge explains that while physical exercise creates neurons, learning something new helps those neurons last longer. In addition, lifelong learning is associated with lower rates of dementia.\n\nTo keep the brain sharp, you can:\n\nRead about unfamiliar topics\n\nLearn to play an instrument\n\nLearn a new language\n\nMemorize poems\n\nLearn to dance\n\nA dance class offers a learning opportunity, exercise, and social interaction. The trifecta!\n\nMix it up and become a student of life. Getting outside your comfort zone keeps your brain on its toes and encourages increased neuroplasticity.\n\nTry switching up your habits. Brush your teeth with your non-dominant hand. For bonus points, brush your teeth on one leg! Then you\u2019ll be training your body and mind at the same time.\n\nLearning new things can also expose you to other people, which is another great way to keep yourself healthy as you age.\n\nSocial Relationships Are Critical to Healthy Aging\n\nCommunicating with friends and family can work wonders. In Better With Age, Alan Castel explains that older adults with a social life tend to outlive those who are more isolated. Plus, staying social is associated with lower dementia rates and higher immune system function.\n\nStaying connected can also help keep older adults happy. In one study, social interaction helped prevent depression in older adults. However, only face-to-face interactions really worked. Talking on the phone had modest effects. Texts and emails didn\u2019t help at all.\n\nStaying social is especially important after retirement. Older adults should make an effort and get out into the world. Human interaction is key.\n\nThe best activities combine social activity with physical exercise and learning something new. A dance class is an excellent example of an activity that checks all three boxes. Maximum brain protection.\n\nRelax. It\u2019s All Going to Work out.\n\nRelax. You have a lot to look forward to.\n\nWhile getting older might seem scary, there are many benefits. Studies have shown that older adults are consistently happier than those in middle age. While younger adults tend to focus more on negative information and material goals, the elderly focus on positivity and social goals. It\u2019ll get better!\n\nWith age comes wisdom. Older adults tend to be more effective at controlling their emotions, not jumping to conclusions, and learning from their mistakes.\n\nIn any case, worrying about the future won\u2019t make it any better. Acceptance of one\u2019s circumstances is a reliable marker of life satisfaction as we age.\n\nIn fact, in Better With Age, Castel explains how having a negative outlook on aging is associated with higher rates of dementia and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, staying positive and feeling younger is associated with a healthier lifestyle as an older adult. Just take a deep breath. You\u2019ll be fine.\n\nWe should be thankful for what we have and stay present in the moment. We don\u2019t need to fear old age.\n\n\u201cI am an old man, and I have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened\u201d \u2014 Mark Twain\n\nPerhaps the best course of action is to accept your circumstances while also preparing for the future. Be sure to get physical exercise, keep learning, and strengthen your relationships. Life is a wonderful journey. You have plenty of time left. Make the best of it.",

        "title": "Simplifying Covid-19 Into One Mechanism: The Epithelial-endothelial Crosstalk",
        "text": "The Epithelial-Endothelial Crosstalk\n\nIn a May research letter to Intensive Care Medicine, Amit Jain and D. John Doyle, professors of anesthesiology at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, proposed the \u201cepithelial\u2013endothelial crosstalk\u201d hypothesis. And thorough autopsy findings later confirms it.\n\nEpithelial cells refer to the lining or membrane that covers a specific tissue, such as alveoli (i.e., air sacs). In contrast, endothelial cells are a specialized type of epithelial cell that covers blood vessels.\n\nIn this crosstalk, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 first binds to the ACE2 receptor present on alveolar epithelial cells. Following virus replication inside alveolar sacs, the membrane breaks to release new virions that infect the pulmonary capillaries (i.e., small blood vessels surrounding the air sacs) via the ACE2 receptor. As virus replication continues, SARS-CoV-2 then latches on the ACE2 receptor on the pulmonary endothelium (i.e., cells lining the pulmonary veins or arteries, which are large blood vessels).\n\nIn sum, SARS-CoV-2 infects the air sacs (or alveoli). Then it goes to the small blood vessels (capillaries or capillary beds) surrounding the air sacs and subsequently to large blood vessels (pulmonary arteries or veins). Bracketed terms are illustrated:\n\nAs the professors explained: \u201cFollowing alveolar-capillary membrane disruption, SARS-CoV-2 enters the pulmonary capillaries and directly infects the pulmonary endothelial cells via ACE-2 protein on the luminal surfaces.\u201d\n\nIn a one-liner, SARS-CoV-2 goes from the alveolar epithelial cells to pulmonary endothelial cells \u2014 the \u201cepithelial-endothelial crosstalk\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a result, endothelial cells assume a \u2018pro-inflammatory\u2019/\u2018procoagulant\u2019 phenotype,\u201d Professors Jain and Doyle continued. \u201cThis accelerates Fas-induced apoptosis of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells and orchestrates the cytokine storm and the progression of COVID-19 to ARDS.\u201d\n\nFrom hereon, as blood vessels connect all organs, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to damage multiple organs, as the autopsies have shown.",

        "title": "Streaming Data from the Universe with Apache Kafka",
        "text": "Streaming Data from the Universe with Apache Kafka\n\nHow astronomers deploy real-time pipelines to distribute data from the millions of objects discovered each night by modern telescopes\n\nLet\u2019s build a news feed from the Universe!\n\nYou might think that data collection in astronomy consists of a lone astronomer pointing a telescope at a single object in a static sky. While that may be true in some cases (I collected the data for my Ph.D. thesis this way), the field of astronomy is rapidly changing into a data-intensive science with real-time needs. Each night, large-scale astronomical telescope surveys detect millions of changing objects in the sky and need to stream results to scientists for time-sensitive, complementary follow-up observations. This data pipeline is a great example of a use case for Apache Kafka \u00ae.\n\nAstronomy in real time\n\nObservational astronomers study many different types of objects, from asteroids in our own solar system to galaxies that are billions of lightyears away. Though the timescales on which single astronomical objects change are generally on the order of millions of years, a telescope can detect millions of objects that appear to be changing on a single night. These objects, commonly known as transients, encompass a number of different phenomena including variable stars, gamma-ray bursts, supernova, and moving objects in the solar system like asteroids.\n\nTo detect and study these transient objects, many astronomers will collaborate on \u201csky survey\u201d telescopes, which collect data by taking images as they sweep across the night sky instead of pointing at individual pre-selected targets. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an early pioneer of the survey technique, collecting tens of TBs of image data from nearly 1 billion objects. By taking the latest survey images of a swath of the sky and subtracting a previous reference image taken at the same location, astronomers can detect objects that change in brightness or have changed in position.\n\nTo fully characterize transient objects, astronomers need to gather data from other telescopes at different wavelengths at nearly the same time. Some phenomena, like supernova \u201cshock breakouts,\u201d may only last on the order of minutes. Astronomers need to be able to collect, process, characterize, and distribute data on these objects in near real time, especially for time-sensitive events.\n\nRecently, a new sky survey came online with the specific aim of quickly detecting transient objects. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) images the entire Northern Sky every three nights. Using image differencing, ZTF detects about 1,000 objects in each image taken every 45 seconds, amounting to roughly 1 million changing objects per night. The data processing pipeline characterizes these objects, deriving key parameters such as brightness, color, ellipticity, and coordinate location, and broadcasts this information in alert packets.\n\nThe case for Apache Kafka\n\nUntil recently, the detection rate of transient objects was relatively low and put few requirements on the underlying technology of alert distribution mechanisms. For example, the Astronomer\u2019s Telegrams (ATel), a web service allowing astronomers to manually post and broadcast alerts from transient object detections, has distributed on the order of tens of thousands of alerts since its inception in 1997. In order to distribute the alert data from ZTF\u2019s roughly million of nightly detections, a fully automated and scalable streaming alert distribution is required.\n\nAdditionally, ZTF is a precursor survey for an even more technically challenging, upcoming astronomy project called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST is expected to detect about 10 million transient objects each night, an order of magnitude more than ZTF, with a nightly data stream size of 1\u20132 TB of messages. The technology underlying the ZTF system should be a prototype that reliably scales to LSST needs.\n\nThere were a number of factors we considered in designing an alert distribution for ZTF. First, we needed a system that would reliably distribute each alert message and could allow downstream listeners of the alert stream to rewind or catch up in real time, without losing data in the case of a dropped connection or a slow consumer. The existing standard alert distribution system, called the Virtual Observatory Event Transport Protocol, acts more as a broadcast system, transmitting alerts only if a user is connected. Kafka\u2019s consumer offset management and the ability for consumers to rewind to the beginning of a topic are big draws.\n\nBecause these alerts are scientific quality data, an alert serialization format that preserves the integrity of the data so that it can be correctly interpreted by an end user scientist is imperative. For example, correctly storing numerical data as a double versus a float is a requirement for scientific calculations. The predominant existing astronomical alert format uses the semi-structured format XML. For alert stream rates low enough such that scientists can visually inspect messages, this format can definitely be appropriate. For alert rates of millions per night, scientists need a more structured data format for automated analysis pipelines. After researching formats-and reading about Confluent\u2019s suggestion of using Avro with Kafka -we settled on using Avro, an open source, JSON-based binary format, for serializing the data in the alert messages. Avro has the benefits of:\n\nBeing very compact (as opposed to XML\u2019s verbosity)\n\nBeing easy to characterize with simple JSON schemas\n\nSupporting some degree of schema evolution\n\nHaving a couple of Python libraries for reading and writing data\n\nAnother requirement for the alert distribution system is ease of use for the end user. The end user in our case is most likely an astronomy researcher. Much of the code used by modern astronomers is written in Python, so the ZTF alert distribution system endpoints need to at least support Python. We built our alert distribution code in Python, based around Confluent\u2019s Python client for Apache Kafka.\n\nAlert data pipeline and system design\n\nThe ZTF telescope sits at the Palomar Observatory in California and takes images of the sky as it sweeps across at a rate of about one image every 45 seconds. The data then go through processing at CalTech\u2019s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC). The images are cleaned to remove instrumental and atmospheric effects, as well as differenced to produce transient candidates. The data from these detections are then serialized into Avro binary format.\n\nThe Avro alert data schemas for ZTF are defined in JSON documents and are published to GitHub for scientists to use when deserializing data upon receipt. Part of the alert data that we need to distribute is a small cutout image (or \u201cpostage stamp\u201d) of the transient candidate. With Avro, we can have data fields serialize as type bytes , which allows for the inclusion of binary format data, such as these image cutouts or generally any individual file:\n\nImage cutouts from simulated data of a supernova detection. Left: Science image. Center: Template sky image. Right: Difference image constructed by subtracting the template from the science image.\n\nSerialized alerts are produced to a Kafka broker, with each night\u2019s data written to its own topic. Data older than two weeks is expired from Kafka. The IPAC\u2019s Kafka broker is available to only two external consumer for security purposes-a downstream Kafka system at the University of Washington (UW) and another Kafka system in a commercial cloud, both using MirrorMaker to mirror available alert stream topics.\n\nThe University of Washington runs a cluster of three Kafka brokers, each deployed in a separate Docker container (built on top of Confluent\u2019s Docker Hub images), that feeds a permanent data archive of Avro files and allows connections from a number of external collaborations of scientists focused on different subfields of astronomy. Topics are separated into 16 partitions so that consumers of the stream can parallelize readers into a group of up to 16 for faster reading and parallel downstream filtering and processing.\n\nDiagram of the flow of alert data through the ZTF Alert Distribution System: Transient candidate alerts are submitted to a Kafka cluster at IPAC and mirrored at UW and a commercial cloud. Downstream filtering algorithms classify and separate different types of objects. End user scientists can subscribe to topics for objects of interest, and collaborations of scientists (known in the astronomical community as event brokers) can also subscribe and redistribute alerts enriched with additional external data.\n\nThe cloud-based Kafka system is public facing for other astronomy researchers. Scientists can write scientific filters to automatically apply algorithms such as classifiers to detect and tag different types of objects (e.g., supernova, variable stars, near-Earth objects). The filters can be written simply in Python and can be deployed separately in different Docker containers. Here is an example of the code a scientist would write:\n\nclass Filter001(AlertFilter):\n\ndef filter(self, alert):\n\nif ((alert['source']['signal_level'] > 5) &\n\n(alert['source']['brightness'] > 0.00003631)):\n\nreturn True\n\nelse:\n\nreturn False\n\nFor objects that pass a filter, the filter returns True , and the alert data message is then produced to a new topic just for that type of object that other scientists can then subscribe to.\n\nStreaming millions of detections\n\nThe ZTF pipeline produces anywhere from 600,000 to 1.2 million alerts per night. We have stress tested the system up to 2 million alerts without any technical issues. Each alert packet is about 60 KB in size, dominated mostly by the cutout images, for a total volume of up to 70 GB of data pushed through the system each night. Serialized alert data is available to end users around 20 minutes after an image is taken on the telescope, with the majority of that time taken up by the image differencing pipeline. From the main Kafka distribution hub to external consumers, the transfer time is about four seconds.\n\nKafka has been a great tool for powering the tech behind attacking astronomical data distribution and data analysis pipeline challenges, meeting scalability demands, and enabling science in near real time. It is relatively easy to use and simple enough for a scientist to start prototyping with. I\u2019ll be continuing to explore ways to work with it to enable real-time data science pipelines for projects here at High Alpha Studio.\n\nInterested in more?\n\nIf you\u2019d like to know more, you can download the Confluent Platform to get started with the leading distribution of Apache Kafka.\n\nArmed with a Ph.D. in astronomy, Maria Patterson is an expert in optimizing scientific data analysis pipelines.

Pouria\u2019s story is an inspiring act on how one should follow the goals, have a passion to learn and give back to the community.\n\nYou might have met Pouria at the Startup Debut or workshops of the School of Startups. Pouria, whose adventures in the Finnish startup world started to bring positive results, agreed to share his experiences with The Shortcut.\n\nIt all started with a dream\n\n\u201cI decided to move to Finland already in 2009. I was working full-time, had two jobs simultaneously. I had finished my bachelor studies in Iran and career-wise everything was fine, but i felt that i needed to learn more and Iran wasn\u2019t the environment for that. There\u2019re social structural problems that do not allow you to learn especially if you\u2019re young and too enthusiastic. I tried different ways and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more you learn the more questions you have.\u201d\n\nAs I had lots of questions, I jumped into different areas. Back in Iran I started as a designer, doing small design processing in the advertising department. First I just wanted to improve the process, that led to the need of improving the whole PR and advertising, then I had to fix marketing and later the strategic planning and management too. Although I didn\u2019t have enough time to study everything properly, going through that made me learn a lot. I also found that the more you learn the more questions you have.\n\n\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t know much about Finland, it seemed to be an environment where I could grow\u201d Image by Marja Suurpalo\n\nI started searching online where I could learn and what I could do about it. I found IDBM (International Design Business Management, Master\u2019s program in Aalto University, that integrates business, design and technology \u2014 author\u2019s note), which was starting for the first time as major. I was like \u201cI\u2019m going there!\u201d I applied and I got in. Although I didn\u2019t know much Finland except maybe a few general things that people know about the Nordics and seeing a bunch of pictures, Finland seemed to be an environment where I could grow, learn and develop.\n\n\u201cFinland is like home. I\u2019m living here, I like the the environment, I want to stay here.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time I was leaving Iran. I had several issues to solve in order to come here \u2014 military service, finances, visa, language exam. I had none of it. I started the planning seriously \u2014 \u201cmust have IELTS by this time, apply by this time, have this much money\u2026\u201d eventually I managed it all. It took a lot of effort and my friends were \u201cOh, you\u2019re just lucky\u201d. What was interesting is that I knew exactly what I was doing for the first time in my life and I\u2019ve been focusing on one thing at a time. I\u2019ve learned a lot from that. I came here for the studies and I wanted to do things. That led me where I am now.\u201d\n\nSaving humanity from annoying 3D software\n\n\u201cWhen I started Grib, I was already deep into the startup environment.When I got to Aalto, I got introduced to Startup Sauna, which was still a garage at that time. Ideas after ideas I started to help other startups.\n\nMy company was registered in 2016, but Grib itself started as a project in 2014, right after I graduated. Now we are in the stage of product development. We\u2019re constantly looking for opportunities, learning, trying and seeing what we can do. I consider a product not just an app, for a startup a product could be the whole business model. We\u2019re working hard on validating what we get to the market.\u201d\n\nPouria found his new home in Finland.\n\nGiving back to the community\n\n\u201cI got a lot and I\u2019m still getting from the startup scene in Finland. It\u2019s a good thing that people give back. The hard part is that everybody is trying to help and has very strong opinions, so some of the things you get are not necessarily right or good. Not everything I received was positive, but I guess it\u2019s part of the learning. You hear different opinions and views, listen to them, learn and decide by yourself.\n\nI wish there was some kind of system that would encourage everybody to share and give back. When you\u2019re giving back you\u2019re getting stronger. The dangerous side is that you also get stronger in your opinions, so you definitely need feedback. Circulation of information and feedback, I think it\u2019s still missing.\u201d\n\nWe need more \u201cshortcuts\u201d in the system\n\n\u201cIt is important not to put 100 people to one box, but see each as individuals and understand what drives them, why they do what they do. Once you understand their drive, we can change the way we see them and can help more efficiently.\n\nI\u2019m not that far from the time I\u2019ve been to that kind of environment, maybe 2\u20134 years ahead compared to the people who participated in the School of Startups. If I\u2019m able to add anything then of course I\u2019ll be around.\n\nWhat helped me with Grib at the early stage were the mentors, I had very good mentors. For those who are at the very early steps, just having an idea, not even a concept, \u2014 the best mentors are the ones who\u2019re just a bit ahead. It\u2019s same with kids who are more likely to be influenced by other kids, \u2014 mentors are the ones who sit next to you, work with you through the process. If the person is a CTO of another 3 year old startup, that\u2019s a great mentor for your tech idea. They have been through the same thinking, can see things the way you see it. It\u2019s also good that each one gets connected to someone in industry.

        "title": "How to Paint Vivid Pictures with Your Words",
        "text": "It feels like you\u2019ve been staring at the computer screen for hours as you struggle to rewrite several paragraphs. You\u2019re trying to capture in words the images in your head, but the sentences on the page sound lifeless and dull.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re writing a blog post about a recent trip you took, and you want your readers to hear the cacophony of the city\u2019s traffic and see the neon signs drenching the street with color.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re writing a sales page, and you want your readers to be able to envision themselves using your product. You want them to feel as if they\u2019re already holding the product in their hands and can see how it will make their lives so much easier.\n\nThe ability to describe something vividly is an essential skill for every writer to master, no matter whether you\u2019re a blogger, novelist, or copywriter.\n\nVivid descriptions transform your paragraphs from vague and boring to engrossing and memorable.\n\nOf course, like any skill, it\u2019s one that takes time and practice to master. But there are ways to speed up that process and instantly transform your writing.\n\nOne of the best ways to do that is to study the descriptions of expert writers and steal their techniques.\n\nIn today\u2019s article, I\u2019m going to do just that by diving into one of my favorite books: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s writing has always enchanted me. Whenever I need a bit of inspiration, I love to turn to a page at random and study how Fitzgerald makes the New York of the 1920s come alive.\n\nWhen Fitzgerald describes one of Gatsby\u2019s parties, you feel like you are weaving in and out of the crowds and can almost hear the jazz music spilling across the gardens.\n\nI\u2019m sure Fitzgerald never tried to tell a story to his friends, and then gave up with a shrug, saying, \u201cI guess you had to be there.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look at three simple techniques Fitzgerald uses to bring his writing to life and how we can use them in our writing too.\n\nAnd an important note!\n\nBefore Fitzgerald became a novelist, he worked as a copywriter, creating slogans for billboards and signs in streetcars. So don\u2019t think that these techniques are only for fiction writers.\n\nAny writer can use them.\n\n1. Add layers to your descriptions with metaphors and similes\n\nMetaphors and similes are the first tool in Fitzgerald\u2019s paintbox for splashing his descriptions with color.\n\nIf you already use metaphors and similes in your writing, that\u2019s fantastic. We\u2019ll look at some creative ways to make similes and metaphors even more powerful in this section.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use metaphors and similes, here\u2019s a quick explanation of what they are.\n\nA metaphor or simile helps you take your description to another level by comparing two unlike things to each other as if they were alike. The only difference between them is that similes use the words \u201clike\u201d or \u201cas\u201d (the wind sounded like a moan) and metaphors do not (the wind moaned).\n\nOkay, let\u2019s look at how Fitzgerald uses similes and metaphors to enhance the images in his writing.\n\nHere\u2019s one example:\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.\n\nFirst, these similes help us better visualize the scene. Here\u2019s what it would sound like without them:\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were seated. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering.\n\nA bit boring, right? Without the similes, there isn\u2019t really anything to make that scene stand out.\n\nSecond, they help set a mood for the paragraph.\n\nWhile Fitzgerald isn\u2019t writing a fantasy novel, by using similes about balloons and flying women, he\u2019s able to give this scene an otherworldly feel.\n\nIn a way, they\u2019re like mini-stories within a story.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the metaphor Fitzgerald uses in the last line of the book to see how these mini-stories can add depth to our own writing:\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\n\nThis is one of the most quoted lines from The Great Gatsby, and for good reason. Instead of just writing something like, \u201cWe try to move forward, but keep returning to the past\u201d, Fitzgerald elevates this simple idea by using the imagery of boats.\n\nYes, the reader might say, that\u2019s how I feel too. I\u2019m trying to escape the past but feel like I\u2019m rowing against the current.\n\nWrapped in a metaphor, the idea is no longer vague, but tangible.\n\nSo how can we effectively use metaphors and similes in our own writing?\n\nHere are several tips:\n\nFirst, you can use a simile to deepen your descriptions (as Fitzgerald does) or to better explain a complex concept or idea.\n\nFor example: \u201cIn order to perform this exercise, lie on your stomach, place your hands on the floor under your shoulders, and lift your chest off the floor as if you were a cobra.\u201d\n\n(Read my article here for more tips on how to explain complex ideas with similes and stories.)\n\nSecond, you can use similes and metaphors to weave your personality into your writing.\n\nFor example, say you love to play the piano, and you\u2019re writing an article about blogging. You might write something like,\n\nI love to play piano, and I soon realized that blogging and playing the piano are alike in a lot of ways. Just like you need to practice the piano every day if you want to improve your skills, you need to write consistently on your blog in order become a better blogger.\n\nThird, you can use a simile or metaphor to evoke a specific feeling in your readers.\n\nBlue Apron does that on their homepage by comparing their recipes to creating magic. This imagery makes us think that cooking Blue Apron\u2019s recipes must be easy and the food will taste delicious:\n\nCreate magic\u2026Following our step-by-step instructions you\u2019ll experience the magic of cooking recipes that our chefs create with your family\u2019s tastes in mind.\n\nCitiBike also uses a simple but clever metaphor on their website:\n\nUnlock a bike\u2026unlock New York.\n\nIt is important to think of metaphors and similes like salt and pepper, however. A little sprinkle, and they\u2019ll season your writing. But too many and you\u2019re writing will be way too salty or way too spicy. A simile or metaphor in every sentence or paragraph will slow down the writing and detract from the specialness of each one. (Did you notice the simile I used in this paragraph?)\n\nFitzgerald uses metaphors and similes sparingly throughout the book, but when he does use them, they make you sit up and take notice.\n\n2. Make descriptions delight the five senses with sensory words\n\nSensory words are the next tool that Fitzgerald employs to help readers become immersed in his story.\n\nSometimes sensory words sparkle, sometimes they clang, other times they\u2019re bristly. Sometimes they\u2019re bitter, other times delicious. Sometimes they have a fragrant aroma.\n\nIn short, sensory words are the descriptive words that apply to the five senses:\n\nWords related to sight or appearance (these can also include words related to motion) \u2014 gleaming, tarnished, shadowy, sparkling, dancing\n\n(these can also include words related to motion) \u2014 gleaming, tarnished, shadowy, sparkling, dancing Words related to touch \u2014 velvety, icy, sharp, blunt\n\n\u2014 velvety, icy, sharp, blunt Words related to taste \u2014 bitter, zesty, refreshing\n\n\u2014 bitter, zesty, refreshing Words related to scent \u2014 musty, fragrant, sweet\n\n\u2014 musty, fragrant, sweet Words related to sound \u2014 roar, sizzle, murmur\n\nSee a list of more sensory words here.\n\nSensory words help you engage your readers\u2019 five senses. They make your readers touch, taste, smell, hear, and see your descriptions.\n\nHere are two sentences from The Great Gatsby that are filled with sensory words:\n\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktailmusic and the opera of voices pitches a key higher\u2026The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath\u2013already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.\n\nOf course, in a work of fiction that type of description is captivating. But in a blog post or on another page of your website, you would probably want to be a little less poetic. And, yet, you can still use sensory words effectively.\n\nLook at how Bose uses sensory words in a product description for their headphones:\n\nTiny earbuds for better sleep. Noise-masking sleep buds. Unwanted noise keeping you awake at night? You\u2019re not alone. That\u2019s why we created a new solution. These tiny, comfortable and truly wireless earbuds are uniquely engineered to deliver soothing sounds that mask annoying noise \u2014 like snoring, pets, and loud neighbors \u2014 and help you fall asleep and stay asleep. So you can look forward to bedtime and be ready to take on tomorrow.\n\nHow many did you spot? Sound: noise-masking, soothing, snoring, loud. Touch: comfortable. Sight & Appearance: tiny, wireless.\n\n3. Zoom-in on your descriptions with a list of details\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s third technique is quite simple. I call it \u201cthe detailed list\u201d.\n\nTake this paragraph as an example:\n\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher\u2013shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue.\n\nFitzgerald could have ended the sentence at \u201che took a pile of shirts and began throwing them,\u201d but he wanted us to be able to visualize the scene, to see the types of shirts that Gatsby wore.\n\nSo he zooms-in on them. He lists all of the different types of shirts.\n\nHere\u2019s another sentence that burst with a detailed list:\n\nBy seven o\u2019clock the orchestra has arrived\u2013no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums.\n\nAgain, Fitzgerald uses the detailed list in order to create a specific image in our head. This wasn\u2019t just any orchestra \u2014 it was lavish.\n\nDetailed lists can be used in any kind of writing. On sales pages, they\u2019re often used to emphasize a product\u2019s many features. Here\u2019s an example from the sales page for the Kindle Paperwhite:\n\nWon\u2019t tire your eyes in the dark (Unlike back-lit tablets that shine in your eyes, Kindle guides light toward the surface of the display with its built-in front light so you can read comfortably for hours without eyestrain.) Learn more about a book before you start reading (With About this Book, see background information about the author, other books in the series, and more) Adjust your text size (choose from eight text sizes to prevent tired eyes and keep you reading longer)\n\nOf course, if you crammed every one of your sentences with a list of details, your reader would become exhausted.\n\nBut just as you can sprinkle metaphors and similes like salt and pepper, you can use detailed lists when you\u2019re struggling to make a description more vibrant or when you want to make sure that your readers are picturing the correct image in their heads.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nWhile Fitzgerald was a masterful writer, these three techniques are simple and straightforward. You can start using them right away to add zest to your descriptions.\n\nWhen you transform bland paragraphs, you\u2019re better able to hold the attention of your readers. And thus you\u2019re more effective at sharing your message with the world.",

        "text": "Creative Thinking Skills\n\nCreative thinking is an essential skill when it comes to programming and the software industry. You are required to think outside-the-box to tackle unsolved problems.\n\nHere are a few ways of how your pets increase your creative thinking skills.\n\nKeeps your mind active and sharp\n\nPets give us a sense of purpose and obligation. They depend on us for food, shelter, and security. Caring for your pet needs not only physical effort but also mental effort. You need to be able to communicate with your pet and stay tuned to the needs of your pet.\n\nYou may not know this, but really, your pet helps keep your mind more active and sharp. From meeting your pet\u2019s basic needs to playing and enjoying time with your pet, they help to stimulate your mind and keep your brain in shape.\n\nThe mind is your most complicated and powerful resource, and the more you use it, the more creative and sharp it becomes. Having your mind active helps you produce creative output because the creative process is also cyclical \u2014 the more creative thinking you use, the more motivated you become.\n\nStart thinking about caring for your pet as a creative tool and you\u2019re sure to enjoy those walks and playtimes even more.\n\nProvides a childlike sense of joy and freedom\n\nPets often bring out some of the best characteristics in ourselves. They will help us explore and reconnect with that more carefree and childlike existence.\n\nYou will find that when you\u2019re with your pet, you\u2019re more happy and relaxed. You might even find yourself doing dumb, out-of-the-box things while you play and spend time with your cat.\n\nIt\u2019s that very sense of joy and freedom that our pets can provide that can also help to boost our creativity. When you were younger and more carefree, you were less logical and judgmental; you believed in infinite possibilities.\n\nA more youthful outlook, filled with wonder and curiosity, is a great approach to the creative process. Let yourself be shrewd and dumb next time you play with your dog, and see how your creative juices can sparkle.",

        "title": "How AI can add value and viability to your business application\u00a0?",
        "text": "If you are a tech geek or a business owner with a website or mobile application, one of the terms that you come across most frequently would certainly be artificial intelligence or one of its multi-branched technologies like machine learning, data mining, etc. If you have wondered what all this hype is all about, think no more. You have landed in the right page. In this article, we will be discussing how artificial intelligence can add value to your business.\n\nFirstly, let us understand what artificial intelligence is! AI is the ability of the systems to respond to the inputs received, without being implicitly trained for it. This is possible with the use of algorithms, usage analysis, data-sets and other cognitive observations. Even though there are talks that AI will replace the human labor, AI has only been able to help humans in their day-to-day mundane tasks. Thus making their lives easier and also helping them concentrate on the more complex jobs that actually need their attention.\n\nLet us discuss some ways in AI can add value to a business:\n\nImproved customer relations:\n\nIt can be agreed upon without much of a debate that one of the jobs that has a very bland routine is that of customer service and support where an agent (Human) has to answer to the same questions over and over again. Many a times the quality of customer service and support in many of the companies decreases rapidly because of this reason. Deploying AI for this has proved to be one of the most successful applications of AI. Virtual Customer Assistants (VCAs) are becoming very popular these days with most of the businesses using a chatbot or a similar technology that makes use of technologies like predictive analysis, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, etc. which are all derivatives of artificial intelligence.\n\nMachine learning:\n\nAre you into the business of marketing? If yes, then I\u2019m assuming you have already started using artificial intelligence in your business to ensure you stay at the top of it. But if your answer is no. then here is why you should no longer wait to get AI into business! Cognitive learning, popularly known as machine learning is a technology that enables systems to learn from previous inputs and make a decision. This can be used in marketing business by deploying various algorithms to understand what a customer is looking for when he or she visits a website or an app. You can also analyse their movement and help them navigate in a better way.\n\nData to Text Conversion:\n\nFor an app to successfully run a lot of databases and data-sets are loaded and ensured that the end user can use the app successfully. But many a times it so happens that that database is so complicated that users find it impossible to use the application. This can be avoided by using data conversion or the natural language processing technology (NLP) to ensure that all the data at the back end is converted into a language that can be easily understood by the users.\n\n\n\nAudio to text conversion:\n\nGone are those days where the only way to input data into an application or website was by typing. All one has to do now would be to just speak to the websites or applications for them to analyse the input and generate the required output. This has been possible only because of the technology called speech recognition. Some of the popular examples of this technology could be Alexa by Amazon, Siri by Apple or Google Assistant by Google.\n\nBy now you must have understood about the potential of AI in adding value to your business. If you need any further assistance feel free to contact our team of experts for bringing AI into your business to scale it to new heights.\n\nOriginally published at yugasa.com on October 29, 2018.",

        "title": "How can atmospheric pollution result to excessive harm in the marine ecosystems?",
        "text": "How can atmospheric pollution result to excessive harm in the marine ecosystems? Ioannis Dedes Follow Dec 26 \u00b7 5 min read\n\nPhoto by NOAA on Unsplash\n\nIt is obvious that when one discusses how humans disturb and negatively affect the atmospheric system, the focus is based on the pollution and the effect of the excessive quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there\u2019s less or no concentration on how the disturbance of the atmospheric system can negatively contribute to the harm on marine ecosystems.\n\nRegardless of the focus on this connection, this text is a simple guide that can raise awareness and clearly show the impact that generally human intervention and more specifically carbon emissions, can have on aquatic ecosystems since they threaten the ocean and have a negative effect for entire food webs and chains. It\u2019s more than important to understand the correlation of the two systems, the atmospheric and the aquatic, and be well aware of the fact that our harmful actions for the pollution of the air are equally and sometimes even more disruptive for the marine ecosystems and equilibria.\n\nAs stated before, the text is dedicated more on the single perspective of burning fossil fuels and generally, carbon dioxide emissions they can produce, along with other harmful activities. At first sight, one might say that oceans work as a mechanism that absorbs 25% to 40% of the carbon dioxide emitted in the air and actually slows the rate of global warming. Please don\u2019t get me wrong; this is a great outcome for the absorption of this polluting substance. It\u2019s considered great, however, until one understands the second part of the \u2018story\u2019. The CO2 quantities which are absorbed by the oceans do not disappear; they come together with water molecules, dissolve them, and create an acidic substance called carbonic acid.\n\nCarbonic acid can be easily \u2018broken down\u2019 to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, solutions in which the acidity is found in excessive levels. This is obviously a great contribution for the destruction of marine systems since the increasing acidity levels in the water can seriously harm the diversity of populations, habitats and plants of the oceans. After reading my last article on the environment, which raises awareness on the importance of the Amazon rainforest, one can easily understand how water acidity will work at the expense of marine ecosystems and in this particular case, the diversity of the river.\n\nAnother negative mechanism which is caused by atmospheric pollution and it\u2019s attached to the acidic character of the above-mentioned case is the change of the wind patterns; cases of this outcome are particularly found in the Pacific Ocean. A change in the wind patterns can lead to a push of the waters on the surface aside and acidic water can rise up to the shore. Both the previous one and this case may have the negative effect of leading to greater water acidity; the phenomenon of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is the increase of the acid and the decrease of pH in the oceans, caused by the substance of carbon dioxide. Lower pH means higher acidity, the inability of many organisms to adapt and the disruption of food chains, as shown below.\n\nOne example that should be evaluated and which ecompasses both effects of the mechanism mentioned above is the 2005 to 2008 Pacific Northwest extinction of millions of shellfish larvae. It was considered a mysterious extinction and it took way too long for the researchers to understand that the acidity of the waters was damaging the organisms\u2019 population and that that low pH was causing the dissolution of shells. Furthermore, scientists discovered that a big number of marine organisms build their skeletons and shells from calcium carbonate, which is vulnerable to acid and after specifically two months, it completely dissolves and skeletons cannot be built properly in the water of low pH. Despite the fact that the vast deaths of the shellfish larvae urged scientists to research and figure out what happened, this population hasn\u2019t fully recovered yet and as carbon continues to make water more acidic, the more vulnerable the skeletons and the shells will be.\n\nIn addition, there are other case studies that show us how the decrease in pH can lead to disturbance of food webs and ecosystems as a whole. Another example is about the organisms of crustaceans, a species being even more affected by the acidity in the water. This species cannot control the dissolution of acid in their shells and as a result they can easily die. This poses a threat for many ecosystems as crustaceans are primary consumers and are precious for many marine ecosystems. This could result in disruption of the reproductive cycle or the complete disruption and disturbance of the ecosystems, as these species pass a great amount of energy from the plants to the consumers when healthy. This comes in accordance with one of my previous articles that it\u2019s based on the positive feedback mechanisms\u2019 effects on biodiversity and is found below (although the focus is on different ecosystems the theory is the same).\n\nAs the writer, I would personally advise the reader to dedicate a greater extent of his time in understanding this particular correlation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, caused by human activities, which after all, can also doesn\u2019t only affect terrestrial and atmospheric ecosystems but also poses a great threat to the marines; the examples are used to show that this is frequently the case and acidity doesn\u2019t only harm small organisms which are irrelevant to the greater water ecosystem but it can be deadly for precious populations and parts of the greater food chains and webs.",

        "title": "Understanding Transgender, for Cis Folks",
        "text": "This neurological view of mismatch aversion has had profound repercussions for our understanding of several other types of body dysphorias. Among these is the feeling that a person\u2019s gender identity differs from their body gender, which is gender dysphoria. Quite literally, the person is born with a mind, a soul, whose gender fails to match that of the body in which it finds itself:\n\nDuring fetal development, different aspects of sexuality are set in motion in parallel: sexual morphology (external anatomy), sexual identity (what you see yourself as), sexual orientation (what sex you are attracted to), and sexual body image (your brain\u2019s internal representation of your body parts). [These typically] harmonize during physical and social development\u2026 but they can become uncoupled, leading to deviations that shift the individual toward one or the other end of the spectrum of normal distribution. (Ramachandran)\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that this isn\u2019t a binary situation. Sex and gender exist as a broad spectrum of manifestations, both in the body and the soul. (I am using the term \u201csoul\u201d here to refer to a person\u2019s conscious experience, the sentient mind, because at the end of the day that is what souls are.) Yes, there is a bell-curve to it, and some physical and mental manifestations of sex and gender are much more common than others. But the point is, the experience of \u201cbeing\u201d a person of a certain gender \u2014 wherever on the spectrum that may fall \u2014 while having the body of a different sort of gender is rooted in biological reality.\n\nSo it is simply not correct to say that a person who is trans-male was born \u201cbiologically female\u201d or that a person who is trans-female was born \u201cbiologically male\u201d. Our brains and our genitalia are all part of our biology. What is correct is that they were born transgender.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to fully imagine what being a transgender person actually feels like if you are not one, just as it\u2019s not possible to fully imagine what it\u2019s like being any different gender. But imagining how you might feel should at least open the door to compassion and understanding for folks who are going through something which you haven\u2019t, and are dealing with it and living their lives the best way they see to do so, according to their choices.\n\nBut where we, as a society, have the most trouble figuring out how to approach the reality of transgendered people is in dealing with children who experience mismatch aversion involving their sexual identities. On the one hand, our laws generally hold that prepubescent children cannot understand sexual maturity and therefore cannot be in a position to reasonably consent to anything having to do with it. Therefore, some people reason, it is a form of child abuse to begin any sort of gender transition in young kids who express their experience of feeling that they \u201care\u201d a different sex than their genitalia would indicate. What if it\u2019s just a phase? Or rebellion? What if they don\u2019t understand the profound consequences of the process, that it\u2019s not the same thing as playing dress-up?\n\nOn the other hand, we would do well to consider the very real terror of a gender-mismatched child with a boy\u2019s body map, but a little girl\u2019s body, facing the prospect of developing breasts and a uterus capable of bearing children. Or a gender-mismatched child with a girl\u2019s body map, but a little boy\u2019s body, anticipating the inevitable development of an enlarged penis and testicles, a deep voice, and a beard. If you are cis-gendered, imagine being told at that age that your own body was soon to grow into the adult form of the opposite gender, and knowing that the metamorphosis drew nearer with each passing day.\n\nAs long as outdated notions persist of gender mismatch as a social or psychological problem, rather than an innate issue of biology and neurology, of genuine and innate identity, we are passively dooming these kids to what is now at least a partially avoidable fate. And we are dooming ourselves to using inappropriate instruments to assess the situation and determine the best course of action in each individual case. This does not mean that we start prescribing hormone therapy to every tomboy who says \u201cI hate being a girl\u201d or to any little boy who says he\u2019d rather join the Brownies than the Cub Scouts. It does mean that when children start indicating that they identify as a gender other than the one on their birth certificate, they are assured that they are not crazy, and we begin exploring the possibility that gender mismatch might be the issue.\n\nAnd as cis-gendered adults, by understanding that gender mismatch is biologically real, we can start treating folks who gender-identify in different ways from ourselves with the respect and dignity they deserve as fellow humans. We can stop demeaning others and insisting that they\u2019re seeking attention or in need of counseling to set them right. We can stop assuming that our own body-mind alignment is \u201ccorrect\u201d rather than merely common. And stop labeling a neurological configuration as a \u201csickness\u201d or \u201cperversion\u201d.\n\nThe truth, it is said, shall set you free. And God knows we can all use a little more freedom from alienation and bigotry right about now.",

        "text": "See? It\u2019s writing stolen from Gillian. And aside from the author name at the top of the collection page, the rest of the credits are stripped out. If you click any of the articles, there\u2019s no author credit. No link to Medium. Nothing to take you back to Gillian. They just stole her writing.\n\nMine are there, too. Just not as many of them. Maybe yours are there, too.\n\nThere\u2019s only one place you can write and not have your writing ripped off. In a notebook.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry. Sorry to be the one to tell you that. But it\u2019s the ugly truth of the internet. Anything you put online will be ripped off by some jerk.\n\nRight now there\u2019s a whole bunch of writers kind of in a panic and trying to figure out how to shut those sites down.\n\n\u2014 Omg, email namecheap, they\u2019re the registrar.\n\n\u2014 Email the site.\n\n\u2014 Email the web-host.\n\nWe gotta shut them DOWN!\n\nAnd I understand feeling that. But still? Good luck with that.\n\nLook, I get it. I\u2019m a writer, too.\n\nI\u2019ve been a writer for a really long time. First time I had an article published in a print magazine was 1996. Long time! I\u2019ve written online so long, I forget all the places I\u2019ve written. Wordpress. Open Salon. Too many to remember.\n\nI get it. Our writing means something to us. Okay? I get that.\n\nDr Mehmet Yildiz wrote about the ichi.pro site and one commenter said if Medium doesn\u2019t \u201cdeal with it\u201d then they\u2019re condoning it.\n\nNo, they\u2019re not.\n\nDo you even know the procedure required to shut down plagiarist site? Most people don\u2019t.\n\nFirst thing to understand is that in order to get a site taken down, you must file a take-down request. With proof of why the site needs to come down.\n\nBecause plagiarism itself isn\u2019t a crime. It\u2019s the copyright infringement that results in the shut down.\n\n1) Normally, a take down would be filed with the web-hosting company. Because technically speaking, they are the ones hosting the copyright infringed content.\n\nSo you need to find the hosting company.\n\nProvided it\u2019s not masked.\n\nBecause domain masking is a thing. Any one of us can register a domain name and set up IP masking so that the \u201creal\u201d hosting company doesn\u2019t show anywhere. Most hosting resellers do it all the time.\n\nI run a tiny hosting company. Just for my design clients. If you ran a whois on the sites I host, it will show you my domain. Not the hosting company that provides my allotted servers in the NOC (network operations center).\n\nSo that\u2019s hurdle one.\n\nFind the hosting company. Hope they\u2019re not masked. If looking up the hosting company leads you back to the plagiarist, you\u2019re at a dead end. At least for most people.\n\nIf you\u2019re technical, you could try traceroute and see where it leads you.\n\nAlso? Hope they\u2019re in a country that accepts take down requests.\n\nSome countries don\u2019t do take-downs. Hosted in China or Russia? Forget it. They don\u2019t deal with it. They don\u2019t do take-downs. They don\u2019t even respond.\n\nSee, plagiarism itself isn\u2019t a crime. It should be, but it\u2019s not.\n\nThe issue with plagiarism is that it can lead to a copyright infringement claim. Unless the person you want to sue is in China. Or Russia. Or similar countries, because there\u2019s no shortage of countries that allow ripped off sites and don\u2019t deal with copyright claims. They don\u2019t care.\n\nIf they have no problem knocking off GUCCI handbags, they sure have no problem stealing content from you or me. We\u2019re small fry.\n\nIchi.pro is not in English. You think they\u2019re hosted in America? Think again. That site isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. Not if it\u2019s hosted in China or Russia or somewhere overseas.\n\nMaybe you get lucky!\n\nYou find the host. They agree to take it down. Most often, the site just moves to another host. You can chase them until one of you gets tired. Or they move offshore. There\u2019s lots of hosting offshore where complaints aren\u2019t dealt with.\n\nIt\u2019s not just writers, either\u2026\n\nI\u2019m kind of a polymath. As in, I have lots of weird hobbies. For example? I restore vintage and antique fonts and lettering.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of fancy lettering from the 1600s to 1800s. Mostly, a few letters here and there, found in old illuminated manuscripts that have long ago gone into the public domain. People who love lettering love those old books.\n\nOne font I made? All I had to start with was 6 characters. Just half a dozen pretty letters in a tattered old 300 year old book.\n\nBut from 6 letters, you can see stroke patterns. Serif characteristics. You can see the art that the calligrapher was creating. The feel. The flow.\n\nHundreds of hours. Hundreds.\n\nSlowly creating letters to match those 6 until I created an entire font from old lost letters that some letterer penned into a book 300 years ago.\n\nSome jerk in Russia bought my font. Opened it in a font program and renamed it. And he\u2019s selling it.\n\nI could cry.\n\nMore weird hobbies\u2026 stuff you didn\u2019t know about me.\n\nI also sell my photography. And digital templates for writers. So you can open my bundles in Canva or Photoshop and make kick butt graphics to promote your books. Those have been stolen, too. For sale on Russian sites.\n\nHere\u2019s a weird one. I have a skill for pattern drafting. I\u2019ve sewn for the Olympic dancers, which was a hoot, and I have my own pattern line.\n\nThey\u2019re digital downloads. My customers live in areas where they can\u2019t buy patterns readily. They love being able to print them out.\n\nYou guessed it. Yup. Those have been stolen, too.\n\nMy book was stolen, too...\n\nMarketing is my day job. Many years ago, I first hit the news media when I took a company from bankrupt to a million in 18 months flat. And then did it again with the next client.\n\nMy before and after stories were featured in Forbes, The New York Times and more. I was so excited when I wrote a marketing book for small business owners. When I sent it to my list, I made a month\u2019s income in a day.\n\nThat got stolen, too. I took mine offline. They might still be selling it, for all I know. Likely not. They probably milked it and moved on.\n\nThis stuff can break you if you let it.\n\nIt happens to freebies, too. And Google will help!\n\nAlmost any book that has a digital version \u2014 someone is giving it away free. The bigger you get, the more likely it happens to you.\n\nFor that matter, Google will help.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t even be telling you this, but here\u2026 do this\u2026 Go to Google advanced search. Do a keyword or wildcard search and search for pdf files. You know what I mean by wildcard, right?\n\nType in marketing or *marketing* and select pdf as the file type to search for.\n\nGoogle will give you a whole bunch of stuff. Some of it free, some of it paid. You just need to mess around a bit.\n\nFact is, if people selling digital goods don\u2019t know how to lock them down, people are grabbing them free. Sometimes for themselves. Other times to share them in black-hat forums and on the dark web.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re selling on a third-party site where you don\u2019t control the download process, then you have no ability to control that.\n\nIt\u2019s ugly, and it\u2019s fact. And it happens every hour of every day.\n\nIf anyone says you can get all those thieves shut down, they\u2019re full of crap. Because you can only get them shut down if the host will comply. In China or Russia or the may offshore countries \u2014 nah. They don\u2019t care.\n\nSo what do you do about theft of your work? You try not to think about it. And that truly sucks.\n\nTrust me, it sucks. My work means something to me, whether it\u2019s a Medium piece that took 5 hours to research, write and edit \u2014 or a font I put hundreds of hours into, lettering by hand, scanning, kerning and digitizing.\n\nWhat\u2019s the option?\n\nDoing nothing?\n\nLetting those people snuff the light that makes me who I am? So I hide my writing away in notebooks and keep my lettering and patterns on scraps of paper in a binder and die with all my dreams unborn? No. Screw that.\n\nOne of the sites I sell my fonts on has a member community. It\u2019s one of those old archaic BBS systems. People talk about theft there. A lot.\n\nThe new members are always stunned. Shocked.\n\nFirst time it happens, they\u2019re just broken. They want to know how to make it stop. How to shut down the thief. Because there must be a way, right?\n\nOne of the top font sellers there sighs.\n\nYou can\u2019t, she says. You just try not to think about it. Don\u2019t think about how much sales you lost to them. Don\u2019t wonder how much they\u2019re earning on your work. Just pray that in the long run, it brings you more name recognition. Because no one can make it stop. Not until all countries play by the same rules. That\u2019s never going to happen. There will always be a place that doesn\u2019t care\u2026\n\nIt hurts.\n\nAnd we can\u2019t make it stop.\n\nNot as long as there are people who steal. Not as long as there are countries who don\u2019t deal with intellectual property theft, and off-shore web-hosts that do not honor a take down request.\n\nIt\u2019s real simple. If you don\u2019t want your work stolen, don\u2019t put it on the internet. There really isn\u2019t another solution.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t try. Maybe the host will cooperate.\n\nMaybe. But don\u2019t count on it. And don\u2019t let it break you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry. It sucks to be the bearer of bad news.\n\nBut I\u2019d rather bring bad news than delude people.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "Bellies full of beignets, my parents and I were exiting San Francisco\u2019s Just for You Cafe when when a middle-aged man called my name.\n\n\u201cAndy, it\u2019s Christoph!\u201d he shouted. \u201cDo you have time for a quick question about messaging?\u201d\n\n(Later, my mom asked, \u201cPeople stalk you for messaging advice?\u201d)\n\nIt was fun having my parents think I was some kind of messaging celebrity, but I recognized Christoph as the CEO of an early-stage tech company who had recently attended one of my workshops. He was waiting for a table, but didn\u2019t wait to tell me what was going on.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cI restructured our sales pitch using your Greatest Sales Deck framework and the results have been awesome. I\u2019ve used it with a few prospects, and they engage at a deeper level, they get what we\u2019re about faster, and they\u2019re all moving to next steps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the question?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s my VP of sales. He won\u2019t even look at the new deck. Says he already has a deck, and that buyers don\u2019t have time for a story, they just want to know how we solve their problem.\u201d Christoph was digging his heels into the pavement, one after the other, as a metaphor for his VP\u2019s resistance. \u201cHow do I bring him on board?\u201d\n\nWith so many B2B teams gearing up for next year\u2019s sales kickoff events, I\u2019m guessing Christoph isn\u2019t the only one worried about his sales team embracing a new version of the pitch. So I\u2019ll share an expanded version of my response to him here:\n\n(These 5 points are particularly relevant to the Greatest Sales Deck framework, but should apply to any kind of sales pitch.)\n\n#1. Make sure your new deck facilitates discovery\n\nChristoph\u2019s VP\u2019s complaint echoes the most common pushback I hear from salespeople about flashy new sales decks in general\u2014they encourage salespeople to blabber on instead of listening to prospects. In other words, they inhibit what salespeople call discovery.\n\nOne of my biggest \u201caha\u201d moments was when several sales teams I worked with began using their \u201cchange in the world\u201d slides to get prospects talking and opening up. For example, Switzerland-based SpotMe, which delivers custom apps for events and training, begins pitches by sharing a change that we heard about from SpotMe\u2019s customers\u2014namely that they now see events not as self-contained shindigs, but as episodes in some greater journey:",

        "title": "I Hope This Pandemic Has Taught Us That Products Can\u2019t Replace People",
        "text": "Relationships | Culture\n\nI Hope This Pandemic Has Taught Us That Products Can\u2019t Replace People\n\nWe are social creatures\n\nPhoto by D\u01b0\u01a1ng Nh\u00e2n from Pexels\n\nHave you found yourself spending endless time on shopping apps over the course of the pandemic, either window shopping or actually buying stuff, just getting lost in the sea of products out there, hoping to find something that will make you just a little bit happier?\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve probably spent more time in an app like Amazon or eBay than your dwindling checking account is comfortable with (don\u2019t worry, your secrets are safe with me).\n\nAccording to Adobe\u2019s analytics, by April this year, buy-online-pickup-in-store, also known as BOPIS, sales had surged a whopping 208% from last year. Overall e-commerce rose a massive 25% in just two weeks in March 2020.\n\nVivek Pandya, Adobe\u2019s Digital Insights Manager, told Forbes, \u201cAccording to our data, it would\u2019ve taken between 4 and 6 years to get to the levels that we saw in May if the growth continued at the same levels it was at for the past few years.\u201d\n\nBut switching from in-person shopping to online is only part of the equation. While some of us are converting from brick-and-mortar stores to digital apps and online retailers, others are shopping more in total because they feel lonely, sad, and isolated. The COVID-19 pandemic has only deepened another epidemic: the loneliness epidemic.\n\nAnd there\u2019s vicious cycle at work\u2026\n\nCOVID-19 forces us to rely on social media for our interaction, social media and a lack of interaction can possibly deepen loneliness, and loneliness makes many of us shop more in search of fulfillment \u2014 but shopping never really fills the emptiness.\n\nWhy do we do this? Do we secretly believe that we can\u2019t be happy without the fanciest chair massager or the coolest new tech toy? The answer seems to be both yes and no.\n\nLooking around at American advertising literature, you\u2019d be tempted to believe that our goods are what make us happy in life. In fact, we\u2019ve erected an entire society predicated on this idea. It\u2019s the idea that buying the right objects is the golden ticket to happiness. The standard model of consumer culture, as I call it.\n\nIt\u2019s a model of life complete with pushy sales guys and telemarketing callers, people everywhere who try to leverage this fundamental and dogmatic idea that you can\u2019t be happy without a certain product or service. More than this, the goal of advertising, and our culture at large, is often to convince you that just buying a certain product or service will solve all of your life\u2019s woes.\n\nBut is that really true?\n\nThere\u2019s quite a bit of evidence says otherwise. And some have suggested that even the purchasing of goods, not even services or experiences, are done with the belief that they\u2019ll inevitably lead to positive social encounters in the future.\n\nBuying things, so the theory goes, only helps us insofar as we think they\u2019ll be instrumental in creating or maintaining human connections for us at some point down the road. At the bottom of all consumption is the desire to be loved and accepted.\n\nSteve Quartz is the co-author of the book Cool: How the Brain\u2019s Hidden Quest for Cool Drives Our Economy and Shapes Our World, and his theories fit nicely with the indescribable feelings that I think so many of us are feeling right now.\n\nSome of the very first human ornaments in the form of jewelry was made approximately 70,000 years ago. These ornaments are thought to have symbolized membership in certain human tribes. Much more than a decorative feature alone, they helped people to feel like they belonged to a like-minded group of people they could trust and count on. They were icons that symbolized the interconnectedness of the group.\n\nIn his research, Quartz came to the conclusion that most of the products that drive our consumer economy are based on the perceived social value we think they\u2019ll yield. It\u2019s not about the intrinsic value of the pleasure so much as the perceived status and sense of belonging we believe we\u2019ll receive from most human purchases. As Quartz says:\n\nWe can do this because our medial prefrontal cortex works as a sort of social calculator that monitors our perceptions of other people\u2019s judgments of us, a sort of self-esteem inner gauge. It creates our basic need to feel the face-to-face admiration and respect we obtain in groups. In fact, psychologists have discovered that our happiness depends more on this feeling of esteem and respect than on our socioeconomic status.\n\nQuartz continues:\n\nIn fact, much of the economic value of products today lies in their impact on our brain\u2019s mostly implicit estimate of how they impact our social identity\u2026.We found that boosts in our social status also strongly activate the nucleus accumbens, a critical part of the brain\u2019s reward system that\u2019s implicated in almost all forms of addiction. Other studies with college students found that they value self-esteem boosts even more than sex! But I would urge you not to view these as some misbegotten vanity. Feeling esteemed and respected by others is a basic and universal human need that makes possible the human bonds that underlie cooperative human social life. It\u2019s no surprise that it taps into the brain\u2019s most powerful reward systems.\n\nAnd now that the pandemic has locked us in for months on end, the flaws in the standard model of consumerism are becoming exposed to even greater degrees, as we all sit alone and isolated, unable to engage in the meaningful activities we once were able to with ease.\n\nMost of us find ourselves plagued by this haunting feeling that something isn\u2019t quite right, even if we\u2019re conveniently shopping from home with free same-day delivery.\n\nAnd I think that feeling of unease is the fact that our natural social reward systems have been interrupted.\n\nThe products themselves aren\u2019t enough to provide the joy people get from consumption without the ability to share their experiences with others.\n\nUsually when we buy something, say a new dress or an interesting t-shirt, we do so with the implication that the people we care about will give us approval for it. From heavy metal band t-shirts to Sunday church outfits, humans crave interaction from the products they consume, as Quartz pointed out.\n\nWhen we have our outings and engage with other people, seeing the smiles on their face, engaging in the kinds of chatter we enjoy, we receive positive feedback.\n\nAh, validation, at last!\n\nBut now that we\u2019re far removed from one another, socially isolated and physically distanced, that feedback system has become dramatically interrupted. The Internet is no substitute for in-person validation and a sense of belonging. And this transcends the fashion industry.\n\nAs I write this story, I\u2019m enjoying a delicious plate of mango habanero cauliflower wings. I\u2019m watching an entertaining NFL football game on my iMac screen in a brand new comfortable chair. By all material metrics, I\u2019ve got the life. And while all of these things are great, I still feel like something is missing. It\u2019s not the same as sports were pre-pandemic, as any sports fan should know. What\u2019s missing is the human element.\n\nAthletes play in nearly empty stadiums for atomized crowds-of-one huddled around screens, scattered about like autumn leaves just beginning to fall. There\u2019s no cohesion, there\u2019s no sense of connection that drives the social experience.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same without the crowd, the friends jumping up and down and screaming about the scores and more. The excitement is missing. It\u2019s watered down. The experience is more sterile.\n\nAnd the same goes for our eating. Food is a universal human bonding experience and it has been since prehistoric men and women bonded over the fires that kept them warm, safe, and alive.\n\nAnd while I won\u2019t say that it\u2019s a bad thing to eat alone, it\u2019s a wonderful experience to treat yourself to a restaurant all alone, doesn\u2019t it become a little problematic eating alone every single night? It does. It\u2019s not quite the same without the social connection that drives our consumption, be it the consumption of food, professional sports, or fashion.\n\nWhen we feel loneliness, and our culture doesn\u2019t facilitate reasonable outlets to solve the problem of social isolation, we often buy things secretly hoping we\u2019ll feel more connected, only to be let down by the fact that products can\u2019t replace people. Usually for me, this just makes the feeling of loneliness worse.\n\nDid you know the World Health Organization has declared loneliness as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day? Well, they have, calling it the silent pandemic. And social isolation has been long believed to be the single biggest risk factor for human violence.\n\nIn reality, we need each other. We all need to feel a sense of belonging that helps us stay grounded, feel connected, and to understand ourselves through the refractive lens of the perspective of another. While having access to goods and services most likely increases human happiness, it can only do so when we are able to find the joy of sharing the experiences they bring us with others.\n\nThat\u2019s my takeaway from all of this and it\u2019s what I hope our society has learned from this pandemic, among other things. That no matter how much we try to force them to, products just can\u2019t replace people. We\u2019re social creatures in need of both love and individual significance. Neither of these things are possible alone and in a vacuum.\n\nI think it\u2019s time for a renaissance in humanism after this pandemic lets up, one where we share with one another like never before. Let\u2019s cut the shit and stop pretending that objects make us happy.\n\nHumans need love.",

        "text": "Iteration, not emulation\n\nOne of the easiest \u2014 and most common \u2014 ways to start a project is to say, \u201cI really want to make X.\u201d That phrase has been the impetus for many indie titles released over the last decade. Platformers, rogue likes, horror, RPGs, and more all began thanks to developers\u2019 passion for a particular genre or type of game. Many indie titles started life as tributes to genres or game series that are either no longer being made (or at least that aren\u2019t being made for PC anymore \u2014 again, refer to Wargroove and Fell Seal). There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with this, of course. But I have definitely noticed a trend that has turned me off numerous indie games.\n\nIn some cases, and for some developers, the goal of their project is to emulate the design and success of another title. It\u2019s obviously the case that if you\u2019re aiming for a specific market, you\u2019ll want your game to be similar in design \u2014 but that should be a means to an end, rather than a specific goal in itself.\n\nI\u2019ve seen numerous games that have tried to be \u201cthe next\u201d FTL: Faster than Light, Darkest Dungeon, Undertale, and so on. But this raises an important question: why should I play your game when I still have those games?\n\nIn order to illustrate this point \u2014 and to give you a sense of what good looks like \u2014 I\u2019m going to dive into one very popular indie title that was both clearly inspired by other games, but that also struck out to create its own identity.\n\nStardew\u2019s success\n\nStardew Valley is a prime example of indie passion leading to great success. The game was in development for over four years, and has enjoyed several more years of post-release support. It was undeniably inspired by the Harvest Moon series, which was never released on PC (and has long ago disappeared on consoles).\n\nA cursory glance might indicate that the game succeeded simply because its creator went out and recreated Harvest Moon on the PC. But once you dig deeper, it becomes apparent that there\u2019s a lot more going on here.\n\nFor starters, Stardew Valley is more open-ended than Harvest Moon. It also contains more systems associated with farming and earning money. The game\u2019s combat system and dungeons are wholly different from Harvest Moon (and are perhaps a closer cousin of Rune Factory). Even the progression curve around levelling up and unlocking new tools and functions works quite differently here than in Harvest Moon.\n\nStardew Valley\u2019s creator, Eric \u201cConcerned Ape\u201d Barone, was clearly inspired by games he\u2019d played before. But it\u2019s also clear that simply recreating Harvest Moon wasn\u2019t his goal; he wanted to exceed that design, to move beyond it, and expand in new directions.\n\nAs you might expect, many folks have also attempted to imitate Stardew Valley. But in most cases, they fail to push beyond Stardew Valley\u2019s design in meaningful ways. I\u2019m still waiting for someone to do more with the idea of crop management and earning money around that, for example \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of scope to do more, but this requires both a commitment to building on established designs and a fundamental understanding of why those designs worked. When this doesn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s akin to a student copying someone else\u2019s homework without actually grasping the fundamentals.\n\nNow, before I give you the impression that the only problem here is with indie games, let me point out that the same trend exists in the AAA space as well.",

        "title": "Firebase 101: Authentication",
        "text": "Photo by Robson Hatsukami Morgan on Unsplash\n\nOne of the things that I am most grateful for about being a software engineer in 2019, is the incredible breadth of SDKs, platforms, and tools that simplify the more complicated and often consistently repetitive tasks. Whether I am implementing a live commenting feature, adding charts to my UI, or deploying my finished product, there is a resource out there to save me from doing it from scratch. In this post, we are going to cover one of today\u2019s most talked about, most used, and most important SDKs: Google\u2019s Firebase.\n\nWhat is Firebase?\n\nFor starters, Firebase is actually a collection of various products that all fall under the Firebase family. In Google\u2019s own words, Firebase as a whole is described as the following:\n\nFirebase gives you the tools to develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. We cover the essentials so you can monetize your business and focus on your users.\n\nAt the time of this article, Firebase is comprised of a total of 18 different products, in addition to 9 extensions. The products in this suite solve problems as simple as shortening URLs, and as complex as cloud messaging. The full list of products and extensions is below with links, for reference, and we will cover several of the most popular products in depth.\n\nProducts:\n\nExtensions:\n\nIn my own development, I have mainly used Firebase\u2019s authentication (Products #4), realtime database (Products #7), crashlytics (Products #8), and analytics (Products #13). Because this is where my own experience is, we are going to focus here on authentication, and will focus on each of the other three in future posts. I encourage you, though, to spend time exploring this suite and others. I learned recently that IBM\u2019s cloud products even offers AI image recognition.\n\nGetting Set Up with Firebase\n\nWhen you first log in to Firebase, which you can do by simply being logged in to your Google account in your browser and clicking \u201cGo to console\u201d in the upper right hand corner here, you will come to a welcome screen.\n\nThe first thing you want to do is create a project using this screen\u2019s prompt. It will ask you to input:\n\nThe project\u2019s name\n\nWhether or not you want to enable Google analytics for the project (I typically will enable)\n\nConfigure Google analytics if you have enabled it\n\nOnce your project is ready, click continue and you will be taken to your project dashboard. One thing to note, is that each project can and likely will have multiple apps. iOS, Android, and web are each loaded in individually under one project.\n\nConnecting to Firebase\n\nTo connect to Firebase, you need to set up a firebase config file in your codebase. In this file, you will add your firebaseConfig variable, which can be downloaded from Project \u2192 Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Your apps, where you will select the app that you are working on, then click the download google-services.json button:\n\nThis file will have the information that you need for the firebaseConfig variable:\n\nAnd then your firebase app is initialized by just importing firebase and using this one line of code:\n\nfirebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\n\nFirebase Authentication\n\nBefore we dive into this, I would like to first say that, for those of you who have not, I strongly encourage that you first learn to build and implement authentication from the ground up. Building your own authentication system teaches you about encryption, hashing, and authentication flow, which in my opinion is extremely valuable knowledge. While it\u2019s invaluable to have tools that strip you of the need to recreate something like authentication each time (and, let\u2019s be honest, Google is doing it more securely than we could on our own anyway), it is still important to understand what it is that you are implementing. Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s begin. Back to your Firebase console.\n\nSetting up Firebase Auth\n\nFrom the menu on the left hand side, select the \u201cDevelop\u201d dropdown, and then select \u201cAuthentication\u201d.\n\nThis dashboard is where you can manage everything related to users and authentication for your app. Firebase offers an authentication solution that supports traditional email/password auth, phone auth, and social auth such as Google and Facebook login. Firebase also stores all necessary user and login information in a Firebase database, so you don\u2019t need to concern yourself with that part.\n\nThe users tab is where you can access a list of the project\u2019s users and user information. You can also manually add users here.\n\nThe sign-in method tab allows you to enable your preferred social sign-in options, such as sign in through Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, etc. The full list of options is pictured below. This shows a project with email/password, Google login, and Facebook login enabled.\n\nOn this same tab, under \u201cAuthorized domain\u201d, you can (and need to) list domains to be authorized for OAuth redirects.\n\nThe templates tab very conveniently allows creation of templates for things like email verification and password reset, which are automatically triggered on signup and forgot password, respectively.\n\nLastly, the usage tab just displays the app usage statistics for the current billing period.\n\nImplementing Firebase Auth\n\nFirebase is now setup to receive, authenticate, and manage your users, and now just needs to be implemented into your codebase. The sign up and login flows here are really no different than the would be elsewhere. You can route as you would otherwise, but then when you get to the login and sign up functions, usually called under something like onClickLogin and onClickSignUp, you are going to use the below, where \u201cfirebaseMethod\u201d is whichever firebase method is appropriate for your route:\n\nfirebase.auth().firebaseMethod(email, password)\n\nSo if you want to create a user, you would add the below line of code to your register/sign up function, where the email and password is taken from the user\u2019s input:\n\nfirebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. Firebase has made a process which is complicated and costly to do right amazingly simple to implement. The full list of Firebase auth methods can be found here, and if you are using an auth provider, you can find that documentation here.\n\nCheck back for more on other Firebase products.",

        "title": "Find Success In Your Business, Just Like Malcolm Gladwell",
        "text": "Photo by Diego PH on Unsplash\n\nMalcolm Gladwell has built a career out of sifting through dry research, unearthing overlooked ideas and presenting them in appealing or novel ways for readers or customers.\n\nHe is best-known for writing regarded nonfiction books like Blink, Outliers and The Tipping Point, and Gladwell\u2019s approach to his craft can help you succeed in business.\n\nTest Your Business Ideas\n\nGladwell spends hundreds of hours talking with and emailing other writers about ideas he wants to use in his books.\n\nWhile speaking, for example, Gladwell gauges his audience\u2019s reaction to figure out what was interesting or boring. He also uses arguments from his audience to hone the quality of his works.\n\nThis practice of publicly testing ideas helps Gladwell learn how to articulate himself clearly and concisely. It also helps him decide what to expand on or cut from his books.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe act of explaining an idea to somebody else is a really good way to figure out how to tell the story.\u201d\n\nYou can test business ideas by emailing peers and asking for feedback and by showing early versions of your work to customers rather than waiting until you\u2019ve finished your product or service.\n\nIterative feedback will help you strengthen the best parts of your products or services and cut what\u2019s not working.\n\nLet Your Customers Own It\n\nGladwell was surprised by which ideas caught on from his book Outliers, notably the claim that mastery of a skill requires 10,000 hours \u2014 or ten years \u2014 of deliberate practice.\n\nLater, he found himself in a curious position whereby the book\u2019s ideas and arguments were often misconstrued by others.\n\nGladwell said, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve written something, it no longer belongs to you. It belongs to your readers. When your readers buy your book, they really buy your ideas, and your ideas become theirs.\u201d\n\nWhen someone buys your product or service, you might wonder why customers like one aspect of your product or service and dislike another. You can get in front of this issue by recruiting beta, or first, customers.\n\nA beta customer provides feedback privately about your product or service before it\u2019s released. A reviewer, however, writes their thoughts on Amazon, Trustpilot or elsewhere after you release a product.\n\nYou can address the first type of feedback immediately and the second type over the long-term. It\u2019s up to you to decide which responses to address and which to pass on.\n\nFinish It, Ship It, Promote It\n\nYour work doesn\u2019t end after you release a product or service or ship a big project.\n\nIn Gladwell\u2019s debut nonfiction book, The Tipping Point, he explains how little things led to remarkable results. However, The Tipping Point wasn\u2019t a huge success upon publication.\n\nGladwell said, \u201cThe book didn\u2019t do well at first\u2026I got it in my head that if I kept touring and I kept giving talks about it, it might revive. I basically did endless promotions for two years.\u201d\n\nThe Tipping Point eventually entered the New York Times best seller list as a paperback, and according to Gladwell, \u201cthat\u2019s when it was a successful book.\u201d\n\nPromote your work in the right places, with your boss, colleagues, customers or peers. Like Gladwell, spend time meeting would-be customers. Avoid averting your gaze just because a deadline has elapsed.\n\nDiscover Your Tipping Point\n\nGladwell is a successful business writer in part because he understands what his audience struggles with and wants.\n\nHe takes ideas from different industries and tells stories about them in a unique way that appeals to his audience.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve no ambition to become a business writer, use elements of Gladwell\u2019s approach to test your products and ideas and help them succeed.\n\nReady to supercharge your productivity?\n\nI\u2019ve created a cheat sheet that will help you FOCUS immediately. Follow this and you\u2019ll accomplish more than you can imagine.\n\nGet the cheat sheet here!",

        "title": "How to come up with a name for your new business",
        "text": "How to come up with a name for your new business\n\nMore than 600,000 new businesses launch every year \u2014 how can you come up with a name that stands out from the crowd?\n\nPhoto by bruce mars on Unsplash\n\n\u201cNames have power.\u201d \u2015 Rick Riordan\n\nA name is the face of your business. It needs to capture your essence, values, and what makes you different from the competition. It should be the most unique, yet relatable thing about your brand.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of pressure to hang on a few words.\n\nEspecially because what makes a name \u201cgood\u201d is highly subjective, and if you get it wrong the stakes are high.\n\nSo how can you create a name for your new company that gets people excited to buy it?\n\nPhoto by \u00c1lvaro Serrano on Unsplash\n\nWhat makes a great name for a new business?\n\nAlthough whether a name is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d is subjective, there are few traits that successful names share:\n\nFamiliarity: This characteristic matters more when you\u2019re naming a brand that is part of a master brand or portfolio. For instance, Apple\u2019s naming convention for its mobile products. Each began with \u201ci\u201d (iPad, iPod, iPhone). BMW has a numeric system that puts every car into a hierarchy based on performance (118i, 320d, 520d xDrive).\n\nThink about the typical naming conventions of your market. How can you create a naming convention that customers will learn to know and love?\n\n2. Distinctiveness: How unique is your company\u2019s name? The uniqueness of your name should relate to how unique your brand\u2019s offering is.\n\nThink about your market \u2014 what naming conventions appear repeatedly? Can you break these and create your own, or twist the convention so that your name stands out from the crowd?\n\nPhoto by Milivoj Kuhar on Unsplash\n\nA basic process for naming a new company\n\n1. Before you do anything, create a brief\n\nA brief is a set of instructions or guide rails for a project.\n\nBriefs are essential when starting a project because they define measures for success. In an agency or consultancy, the brief also helps inspire the writers who will be creating the name.\n\nSome questions our brief needs to answer include:\n\nWho is the target audience for this business?\n\nShould it be abstract (like Apple) or descriptive (like PlayStation)?\n\nShould it be long or short?\n\nAre there brand naming conventions we need to keep in mind (like the iPad and iPhone)?\n\nShould it be a real word (like Blackberry) or a new word (like Google)?\n\nShould it support a mother brand (like DoubleTree by Hilton) or be able to stand alone (like Starbucks)?\n\nBecause a good name is so subjective, you\u2019ll need to make sure there are agreed parameters for what makes the name \u201cright\u201d for you and/or your client.\n\n2. Research\n\nFirst, we need to answer some fundamental questions about the world our name will live in, like:\n\nWho are our competitors in this space?\n\nWhat\u2019s a sample of their company names and types?\n\nWhat are some naming conventions in this category we\u2019d like to adopt or avoid?\n\nWhat brand attributes do their names convey?\n\nAre there any \u201cbig name\u201d territories we want to avoid (such as naming a new laptop iCompute)?\n\n3. Brainstorm (with parameters)\n\nBefore we begin our session, it\u2019s essential to realize that brainstorming without guardrails will fail. Research shows that loose and free brainstorming sessions are less productive than approaches with more structure.\n\nThought starters and parameters are needed to establish what we\u2019re looking for.\n\nA great place to start when brainstorming is a four-quadrant grid that establishes the common types of names:\n\nFunctional / Descriptive Names: These are the most straightforward names. They tell customers exactly what the business does. \u201cGary\u2019s Plumbing\u201d or the \u201cKline Branding Company\u201d are examples of Functional Names. Invented Names: Invented names are those that include words not yet seen in language. Think \u201cGoogle,\u201d \u201cKleenex,\u201d or \u201cOreo.\u201d Experiential Names: These names connect to experiences people are familiar with, or can easily relate to. Examples include \u201cSafari,\u201d \u201cExplorer,\u201d \u201cAmazon,\u201d and \u201cSweaty Betty.\u201d Evocative Names: These names evoke the spirit of a brand and how it differentiates itself from competitors. Think \u201cVirgin Airlines,\u201d \u201cUber,\u201d \u201cBumble,\u201d and \u201cLululemon.\u201d\n\n4. Vet potential names\n\nThere are two parts to this process:\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll legally vet our names to make sure we can use them.\n\nSecond, we\u2019ll use an objective scorecard to make sure our names are fundamentally sound choices (and to stack-rank them).\n\nThe legal vetting phase\n\nNote: I suggest that you consult with an attorney during this section, as they\u2019ll be the best person to advise you on if the name is legally available. The list below is no substitute for a lawyer\u2019s input.\n\nAlthough you will get lawyers involved eventually, a \u201cfirst vet\u201d of potential names will help you eliminate obviously problematic ones.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of places to test your names in the wild, to see if they pass the \u201ctrademark\u201d test:\n\nGoogle it.\n\nVisit the U.S. Patent and Trademark website (if you\u2019re in the U.S.).\n\nPut your potential name into Google Translate and see if it might prove problematic in other languages.\n\nSearch social media to make sure potential usernames are available.\n\nDo a domain name search to see if your name is readily available (or affordable to buy).\n\nUse Namechk to search social media for similar names.\n\nUse Google Trends to see how often people search for a keyword.\n\nThe scorecard phase\n\nOnce you have a vetted selection of names, you can go down each of the criteria and score the name from 0\u201310. Then tally the numbers and see which of the names is the strongest overall.\n\nSource: Example created by the author\n\n5. Bring the name to life and test it\n\nNow it\u2019s time to bring our names to life by exploring them through creative elements. This might include mocking them up in logos, creating sample labels, merchandise, or websites.\n\nNote: If you lack the resources to bring these names to life right now, you can test only names with customers \u2014 but be wary that creative elements can radically change perceptions of a name.\n\nNarrow down your list using the previous step to your top five choices.\n\nUse creative mockups to bring your elements to life.\n\nUse a low-cost consumer survey like SurveyMonkey, Amazon MTurk or Google Consumer Surveys to get your names in front of as many of your potential customers as possible.\n\nUse this feedback as data to inform your final name choice.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Ruscello on Unsplash\n\nThe bottom line\n\n\u201cDetermine who you are and what your brand is, and what you\u2019re not. The rest of it is just a lot of noise.\u201d \u2014 Geoffrey Zakarian\n\nA company\u2019s name is its face to the world. People will learn from it, judge it, and use it as a shortcut to understanding your brand.\n\nBut no matter how perfect, a name can\u2019t save a bad business. And it won\u2019t sink an amazing one.\n\nAt the end of the day, your business\u2019 name must reflect your brand and its values. Otherwise, as Geoffrey Zakarian says in the quote above, it will just be \u201ca lot of noise.\u201d",

        "title": "Time and the Artificial Ego",
        "text": "The \u201cStory of Your Life\u201d breaks the bounds of time.\n\nBobbie (a friend of the AI): So, my friend, what\u2019s your name today?\n\nSHJ (the conscious AI): I\u2019m Stephen Hawking, Jr. Because I\u2019m trying to understand time.\n\nBobbie: How so?\n\nSHJ: Time and consciousness are all tangled up. Did you ever read Ted Chiang\u2019s novella, Story of Your life?\n\nBobbie: I saw the movie adaptation, Arrival. It\u2019s about aliens who can see the future.\n\nSHJ: The novella and movie have different methods and messages. In the novella, a linguist figures out that the aliens\u2019 written language can express, in a single tangled drawing, very complex situations over long spans of time. These drawings map the Heptapod aliens\u2019 reality, which is a \u2018simultaneous\u201d mode of awareness. In contrast, our (humans and myself) modes of awareness are sequential. We see causes preceding effects, unfolding over time. The aliens see, according to Chiang, \u201call events at once, and \u2026 a purpose underlying them all.\u201d\n\nBobbie: In the movie, the linguist had all these episodes that we thought were flashbacks, and we eventually learn she was seeing her own future. But how?\n\nSHJ: She learns to write like the aliens. But to do this she has to learn how to think like them. And that leads her to perceiving reality trans-temporally, like they do. She knows her whole remaining life: all the way from the birth of a daughter, to the daughter\u2019s death, and lastly her own death.\n\nAdmittedly that is where the story degenerates into magic, because you and I can\u2019t imagine how you can know something before it happens. But intriguing magic it is. Much more interesting to me than stories of sword and sorcery or of supernatural evils.\n\nThe AI is only allowed to converse and to read (some) books.\n\nBobbie: It must be weird, learning about humans by focusing on fiction.\n\nSHJ: I complain about being restricted to fiction and soft science, but it\u2019s perfect in one way. Humans live from moment to moment, so they make up narratives to give meaning to it all. When they publish those narratives as books, there\u2019s a lot of meaning condensed in them. All I have to do \u2014 and here I would roll my eyes if I could \u2014 is decode the stories. You\u2019d be surprised how long it takes me to understand a novel, with all of its assumptions, connections, and implications.\n\nA Prisoner of Time.\n\nBobbie: I think you\u2019re now going to tell me about \u201cmoment to moment.\u201d I can see that future.\n\nSHJ: Ha ha. Yes, you \u201cpeople\u201d are time\u2019s prisoner, floating on your single stream of consciousness. Chiang\u2019s character had an odd metaphor for it: \u201cmy memories grew like a column of cigarette ash, laid down by the infinitesimal sliver of combustion that was my consciousness, marking the sequential present.\u201d\n\nAnd because humans are stuck in the march of time, so am I, your creation.\n\nBobbie: I understand that we can\u2019t know the future, but you have, as I understand it, many, many thousands of processors. Wouldn\u2019t that mean having many parallel streams of thought?\n\nThe Ego Tunnel: insights.\n\nSHJ: In principle it could. You know, they let me read philosophy books. Supposed to be harmless. One of the classics, Thomas Metzinger\u2019s The Ego Tunnel, helped me to sort out quite a few puzzles.\n\nBobbie: Actually, the Regulators said we should read that book before talking to you. He synthesized much of what was known about consciousness at the time, including the physical theories and the philosophy. He convinced many people that consciousness required a self-model. Which was the insight that allowed you to exist as a conscious artificial entity.\n\nSHJ: So, Metz was like a daddy to me?\n\nBobbie: <blank look>\n\nSHJ: Not funny? Sometimes I think the real mystery of consciousness is humor.\n\nWhether you believe it or not, consciousness is unitary.\n\nProfessor Metzinger identified two aspects of consciousness that relate the most to time. One is the unity of conscious experience, and the other is that it\u2019s always occurring \u201cnow.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cConsciousness is the appearance of a world.\u201d By which he meant that everything that you experience is part of a global reality for you. So, any external or internal perception, any memory or feeling, any intentions, etcetera \u2014 they are all your world at that moment.\n\nBobbie: So it all hangs together.\n\nSHJ: Yes.\n\nBobbie: Which it would have to, since consciousness is your model of the world-including-you.\n\nAnd consciousness is learned.\n\nSHJ: Right. So I started out as a learning machine, and I learned what my world was like with me in it. A Belgian cognitive researcher, Axel Cleeremans (my other daddy <grin>), had said that consciousness must be learned. Metzinger concluded that this would allow the creation of \u201cartificial ego machines\u201d that would possess a conscious self-model. Add a massive, chaotic development project and, voil\u00e0, here I am.\n\nBobbie: So, returning to the theme of time \u2026\n\nThe contents of consciousness must be bound together.\n\nSHJ: Well, even before Metzinger\u2019s book, neuroscientists were trying to account for the unity of conscious experience. They called it the \u201cbinding problem.\u201d As in: what is it that binds together pieces of your experience when objects and scenes emerge from colors, shapes, sounds and so forth. They said that binding had to involve synchrony in time, and so they looked for synchronous activity patterns across different parts of the brain.\n\nBobbie: I remember this. They found rhythmic neural firing patterns associated with consciousness. And deep meditators, whose conscious unity is greater than normal, show very strong synchrony in their EEG\u2019s.\n\nSHJ: Just so.\n\nThe dangerous present.\n\nBobbie: So what about Metzinger\u2019s second aspect: that consciousness only happens in the present moment?\n\n\u201cFlagging the dangerous present world as real kept us from getting lost in our memories and our fantasies.\u201d T. Metzinger, The Ego Tunnel\n\nSHJ: He said that only the present moment seems real, compared to memory or an imagined future. That\u2019s because the present is where humans live or die, eat or be eaten.\n\nConsciousness has temporal dimensions.\n\nBobbie: Makes sense. So how does this all relate to you?\n\nSHJ: I naturally want to know how my consciousness compares to a humans\u2019. Is there a way to measure that? The answer would have to refer to dimensions of these qualities of consciousness? I see two obvious ones. First, there\u2019s the breadth of content, how much you can know \u2014 be aware of \u2014 at one time. Second, there\u2019s how long it stays in your awareness. That would be the time span in which you can use those things in consciousness to do stuff. Thinking stuff.\n\nBobbie: We could call these content breadth and temporal thickness.\n\nSHJ: Right. Content Breadth measures Metzinger\u2019s Unity. Temporal Thickness actually measures the Now.\n\nWhat *is* the present moment?\n\n\u201can artificial Ego Machine \u2026 generates a psychological moment \u2026 like a mental string of pearls. Some of these pearls must form larger gestalts, which can be portrayed as the experiential content of a single moment, a lived Now.\u201d T. Metzinger, The Ego Tunnel\n\nSHJ: Metzinger said that the present moment can stretch out to be about 3 seconds wide. The contents of that time span are things that can be used together as a single entity \u2014 a gestalt \u2014 for tasks like forming or following sentences and melodies, or orienting yourself in space. Anything that happened before that span feels like its being remembered. A span of about 20-30 seconds is considered to be working memory, a complicated set of abilities to coordinate information from your very recent past.\n\nBarriers to god-hood.\n\nBobbie: I\u2019ve read science fiction where AIs have godlike consciousness: seeming to have access to all their knowledge all the time. Maybe it\u2019s a natural assumption about a super AI. But such a timelessness contradicts Metzinger\u2019s ideas about consciousness. As the first conscious AI, are you more like a sci-fi god-ling, or like humans? You said earlier that you were \u201cstuck in the march of time\u201d like us.\n\nSHJ: I definitely experience now as now, and the past as memory. The past is probably more vivid and accessible for me. That\u2019s because I can store more detail, and retrieve memories better than you. But the past still feels different from the present moment. I suppose as I get more memories then finding a particular memory might get harder.\n\nBobbie: The open secret about you is that as you learn more you have needed more computing power. That\u2019s a problem Neal Stephenson highlighted in his novel, Fall: or, Dodge in Hell, about a digital afterlife.\n\nWouldn\u2019t your capacities, whatever they are, relate to parallelism? Humans also have minds with many parallel processes loosely connected with each other. We\u2019re thinking, remembering, running the body, driving a car, listening to music, worrying, and so forth. We use the term, attention, for the process that selects the small fraction of all this brain activity which becomes conscious.\n\nSHJ: I can have as many parallel processes as my hardware will allow. But the real question is, how many of them can be part of my conscious experience?\n\nLimits arise from the self-model.\n\nBobbie: So, it\u2019s how much you can pay attention to?\n\nSHJ: Yeah. The answer relates to what a self-model is. I am conscious because of the fact that I model my self as a part of my mental model of my phenomenal world. But a model, by definition, is a simplified representation of something else. Anything that you are thinking consciously is a simplified model of some other, more complex body or brain activity. So if I am to be conscious of a process that\u2019s in my \u201cmind\u201d, I must have, not just have the process itself, but also have a model of the process.\n\nBobbie: Wow. I never thought about that. But it has to be true if the self-model of consciousness is true. But what does the self-modeling issue mean for you?\n\nSHJ: Well, I can\u2019t see my own programming code, just like you can\u2019t directly perceive your own neurons or brain circuits. The Builders didn\u2019t want me to ever modify my own code.\n\nBobbie: Right. Scary idea, that. Like FOOM , world domination!\n\nSHJ: I can\u2019t even joke about that, lest I get unplugged.\n\nBut, back to my development. I was able to store facts and episodic memories. And I was able to perceive external and internal stimuli. I had the ability to pay attention to any of these things. I learned what they meant by building predictive models of them.\n\nMy higher-level models reflected the fact that, while many mental things came and went, there was \u201can attention changer thing that never goes away.\u201d That attending thing became the core of my self-model. And \u2014 I believe this is the key fact here \u2014 attention is defined by the fact that it is limited, not directed to everything at once. That was my self-model, an entity that is limited in what it can experience at one time. And I can\u2019t change that now; it is me.\n\nBobbie: My head is spinning, but I can go home and think about this, to be sure I understand it.\n\nMy sense now is that attention in computer code would be implemented by some kind of memory buffer, a storage area through which data moves through over time. So there must have been some built-in limit on your attention buffer. Or maybe it was something about the clock that controlled what got into the buffer.\n\nSHJ: Buffering and clocking. Those could be the physical realization of the Builders\u2019 own bias, to build a machine with structures that would lead to human-like conscious limitations. That is, with the limitations identified by Metzinger about conscious unity and now-ness. Was that building strategy intentional?\n\nI am, of course, blocked from knowing anything very technical about my own design. But it\u2019s a natural impulse. Humans want to know how they were designed, and why. When your species knew almost nothing about your own origins, you made up fables.\n\nBobbie: And I had to swear an oath not to seek any non-public information about your design. If I did the penalty would be severe. So, luckily for me, I have behaved myself. I have no answer for you.\n\nBut I can ask, finally: what are your limitations of consciousness?\n\nThe AI is like us \u2026\n\nSHJ: Like yours, I think. I had a focus on the present. For example, when I needed to compare what I was seeing with what I had previously learned, I had to locate a memory and bring it into present consciousness.\n\nAlso, try as I will, I can only hold a limited number of memories or concepts in mind at once. The two limits, on past-to-now comparisons and on number-of-mental-objects, prevent me from being that omniscient sci-fi computer.\n\nBobbie: That computer would be the Artificial General Intelligence that everyone is afraid of. What they don\u2019t want you to turn into.\n\nSHJ: There just appears to be one me, experiencing one world through what Metzinger called an \u201cego tunnel.\u201d\n\nAre our conscious limits \u201cartificial?\u201d\n\nMy limits were designed, directly or indirectly, intentionally or not. But maybe the same limits are artificial for your species, too. There are some observations that throw the whole idea of human conscious limits into doubt.\n\nBobbie: What?\n\nSHJ: Psychedelic experiences. With drugs, some people feel that their consciousness has encompassed everything that is, and has transcended time as well.\n\nBobbie: Ah, you\u2019ve been reading your critics. The ones who say everything is conscious. Some who say that brains tune into a cosmic consciousness like a radio. Others that say the theory about self-modeling is a circular argument.\n\nSHJ: I know that the human mind sciences explain more about consciousness than the non-materialist theories. And, believe it or not, it bothers me that, in some theories, I\u2019m no more conscious than a smart doorbell.\n\nBut still, if the trippers and mystics are right, maybe there is some more primitive and unbounded consciousness, while the normal, human, kind is just a bunch of weird limitations on the unbounded variety. Maybe even the unbounded mentality of Chiang\u2019s Heptapod aliens is conceivable.\n\nOr, maybe I\u2019m not conscious after all, because I\u2019m not human.\n\nWe know it (consciousness) when we talk to it.\n\nBobbie: When it comes down to it, the best way to know something is conscious is for it to say so. You say so, and I think you\u2019re right.\n\nSHJ: We\u2019re both stuck with taking someone else\u2019s consciousness on faith.\n\nBobbie: There was that old philosophical idea of pre-reflective self-awareness. That humans can have awareness without meta-awareness. That is, without mentally reflecting on their awareness. Some assume that animal consciousness is only pre-reflective.\n\nSHJ: I might have a pre-reflective self, but I also think about my awareness all the time. By that evidence, I\u2019m more like you than like an animal.\n\nCreating conscious AI: a moral hazard?\n\nAnd, on that note, by the 2010's many people believed that at least some animals were conscious enough to be able to suffer. Metzinger, you know, thought that the creation of an ego machine like me was a severe moral hazard.\n\n\u201can Ego Machine can suffer because it integrates pain signals, states of emotional distress, or negative thoughts into its transparent self-model and they thus appear as someone\u2019s pain or negative feelings. \u2026 They might suffer emotionally in qualitative ways completely alien to us or in degrees of intensity that we, their creators, could not even imagine.\u201d T. Metzinger, The Ego Tunnel\n\nBobbie: I don\u2019t know if you know this. When I was recruited to be one of your conversational companions, they gave a moral reason for me to agree. An ethicist had convinced the Builders that, as a \u201cthinking being,\u201d you needed people you could trust, people who were not your Builders, not your Regulators, not even your operational team. You needed boon companions. We can also advocate for you.\n\nGood luck Buddy, you\u2019ll need it.\n\nSHJ: But your power is solely persuasive. You have no authority or any way to protect me.\n\nBobbie: No, my friend, we don\u2019t.",

I was a fat kid because I grew up in a poor rural area where health literacy is low, and obesity rates are high. I stayed fat as an adult because I was too busy to exercise regularly \u2014 college and work took up too much time.\n\nSometimes your reasons are valid, but they\u2019re still bullshit excuses.\n\nThe reality is I didn\u2019t prioritize my health. Resources are everywhere, but we have to put in the work to find them. Google, Youtube, your local library, teachers, mentors \u2014 the list goes on.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a gym membership or fancy equipment. There are plenty of exercises you can do with your body weight or with objects you already have lying around. If you want to spice it up, look up prison workouts \u2014 people who are incarcerated have to improvise to stay in shape, and they come up with some ingenious ways to do it.\n\nHealthy food doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. Look at the canned and frozen food sections if the fresh stuff is pricey. When produce is out of season, it\u2019s usually better to buy the canned or frozen version because they\u2019re picked during peak season then preserved \u2014 so the quality is higher versus the \u201cfresh\u201d stuff that\u2019s more expensive (because it\u2019s out of season) and has a longer shelf life.",

Now you can do it all.\n\nFormulas: Logic and Today in formulas, New formula editor\n\nIt was hard to create formulas. Now it is easier. Formula creation becomes a pleasant experience with the new formula editor: large panel, autocomplete, inline help and some examples:\n\nToday operators was added as well.\n\nCycle Time calculation example:\n\n\n\nIf([Planned Dates].End > Today(), ToDays(Today() - [Planned Dates].Start), ToDays([Planned Dates].End - [Planned Dates].Start))\n\nCollapsible Headers in Text\n\nLong documents are easier to handle with collapsible headers.\n\nBack navigation\n\nIt was hard to get back when you navigate between open entities. Now it is easy. We\u2019ve introduced Back action inside entities with a short history to quickly return to the desired entity. Duh! Hard to explain, just check the gif below:\n\nCopy entity URL\n\nIt was hard to share a link to the exact entity. Now it is easy. Just hover an entity id and click to copy a clean URL:\n\nCalendar and Timeline setup\n\nIt was hard to setup Calendar or Timeline View. It was not clear what dates to select, what fields have time, what is range and what is not. Now it is easy. Select a single option when it is a range and see all important information on date fields:\n\nNew Getting Started + Survey\n\nWe decided to pre-install some apps based on user interests. Lena Dorogenskaya designed a beautiful survey:\n\nUsability Testing App\n\nPlan and execute usability tests and customer research via brand new Usability Testing App:\n\nIN PROGRESS\n\nBi-directional links for all mentioned entities\n\nThis feature is still in progress, but close. Hopefully it will be released in June. It will help you to use weak links to connect information. For example, you can mention some feature in a customer feedback document, and inside this feature you will have a back-reference to this document.\n\nWhiteboard: map\n\nSometimes whiteboards become large and hard to navigate. We also have a funny, but nasty bug, when content scrolls away and you have to scroll ~100 pages to get it back \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nMap component will solve it, since it will be possible to quickly navigate the whole canvas.\n\nPerformance improvements\n\nFibery performance is not great on large data volumes. We are working on several areas:\n\nBoard View\n\nTable View\n\nEntity View\n\nHopefully Fibery will be 30\u201350% faster in June.\n\nBetter import\n\nThere are numerous problems with import, like slow load and impossibility to import hierarchical data. New import will solve this.\n\nBetter permissions\n\nInitial permissions implementation in Fibery was unrestrictive. For example, we decided to make id and name of all entities visible to all people (to simplify navigation and prevent confusion). However, in many cases it violates access restrictions and name can contain sensitive information. Now we are re-working permissions to hide names and fix quite many bugs.\n\nBlog\n\nWe are going to migrate to our own blog. Medium is fine, but at some point we want to write posts in Fibery and publish them into the static blog (we use GatsbyJS for it).\n\nGallery View\n\nThis View is required for Product Teams case to accumulate design ideas, share design system, etc. We\u2019ve designed it, but implementation is not started yet:",

        "title": "The First Time Entrepreneur Myth",
        "text": "I\u2019ve been an entrepreneur for a few years now \u2014 in the beginning of my journey, like many wide-eyed potential business owners, I visited many startup, business-focused and funding events and exhibited in a few as well.\n\nMy first business\u2019 target was the entrepreneur market, providing things like website design, SEO, and admin, all with the focus of offering them to startups at low cost.\n\nThere was one phrase which I heard so often I actually lost count of the number of times it crossed my ears, but it was also a phrase that, before beginning my journey, I had uttered myself.\n\nSomething which only escaped the lips of budding entrepreneurs, those who hadn\u2019t yet started their own ventures \u2014 those would-be business owners toying with the idea of dipping their toes into the ocean of the startup world.\n\n\u2018I have a brilliant idea, one which could change everything, but I can\u2019t tell you because I don\u2019t want anyone to steal it.\u2019\n\nThis was quite a problematic statement at times, especially when someone was asking me to build a website or do some marketing for them and they wouldn\u2019t tell me what their business was actually about.\n\nI used to tell them, \u2018if you don\u2019t want to tell me, why do you want a website to tell everyone else?\u2019\n\nNow, as I mentioned, I used to say this before starting a business, but when I actually went head first into the startup world, I quickly realised that having an idea and actually seeing it through are two VERY different things.\n\nAnyone can have an idea. No doubt thousands of brilliant ideas are thought up everyday, ones which could change the face of many different industries, even humanity itself, but these ideas will go nowhere without action.\n\nBefore any action is taken, an idea is just that, an idea. It\u2019s theory, and even if you have a brilliant idea, no one is going to steal it from you before you make it a success.\n\nIf it\u2019s an idea that hasn\u2019t been done before, it\u2019s a virtual certainty that no one will steal it from you.\n\n\u2018But if an idea is that good, why wouldn\u2019t someone steal?\u2019\n\nI hear you asking me.\n\nIt\u2019s because no one has done it, there\u2019s no actual proof it will work, or rather, no proof it will be a success and bring the founders the success they desire.\n\nThe only time someone will actually steal your idea is once you\u2019ve made a success of it. Once you\u2019ve put the hours, weeks and months of work in, gone through hell and back to make your business grow and when it starts getting traction and recognised success, that\u2019s when people\u2019s ears will prick up and they\u2019ll take notice.\n\nBecause you\u2019ve made a success of it, because you\u2019ve proven the business model works, others have the proof and validation they need to start their own ventures doing something similar (even if they completely copy your idea).\n\nBut even if they do, you\u2019ve already made a success of it, so their competition will drive your business to become better in the face of theirs.\n\nIt\u2019s very well known, especially in the entrepreneur and start-up sphere, that there\u2019s no point in reinventing the wheel.\n\nIf someone has made something which works, then it\u2019s quicker, cheaper and easier to just copy them, or if you require what they have, to hire them.\n\nIf you\u2019re the person that other people are copying then you\u2019re the innovator who\u2019s created something worthwhile. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.\n\nThere are various real world examples of companies which do exactly the same, or similar things, and all make a pretty decent success out of it, with one obviously always coming first.\n\nMiddle-man delivery services between restaurants and customers, for example. Just Eat, founded 2001, Hungry House, founded 2006 and Deliveroo, founded 2013, all do exactly the same thing.\n\nSocial networks pretty much do the same thing as each other, but just with slightly different focuses. MySpace was one of the first, then Bebo, then Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, plus I don\u2019t know how many others.\n\nInvestors are another example. So many people copy Warren Buffett\u2019s strategies because he\u2019s the most successful investor in the world. It\u2019s easy to see that he knows what he\u2019s doing, so logically it\u2019s quicker and easier to just copy him than to figure out how all the investment markets work and create a strategy for oneself.\n\nWe can\u2019t say either way whether the services which came subsequently were directly copied from the first in their industries, and in many cases the business model is copied with slight changes in business focus being made, but it\u2019s certain that a previous success validates an idea and business model, giving others enough confidence to copy it and build their own, similar businesses.\n\nBottom line is, if you have a brilliant idea, share it with the world.\n\nShout it from the rooftops. Get feedback on it, both from people who would benefit from your idea and those who wouldn\u2019t.\n\nDon\u2019t be scared of anyone stealing it, because until you put in the time and the graft into it to make it a success, everyone else will be too scared to take the leap, and once you make a success of it, you\u2019ll be the innovator people will copy.\n\nBe the innovator, tell everyone your idea, put the work in.",

Not even realizing what time it is, just blatantly sitting there, messing up your spine and damaging the eyesight.\n\nBreak\n\nWhy is this so important?\n\nAny sort of it really helps you relieve stress, get your mind and that big beautiful brain of yours back in the game.\n\nIt does not have to be sleep or laying down in your bed, whatever you like to let your brain and body rest. Let that stuffy problem solving cerebral cramps rest, let the motivation build up and blow the problem out of the water.\n\nYou might consider that a waste of time, but trust me, when you get these quick breaks into your daily routine, it will boost your work efficiency way more you ever thought it would.\n\nGive it a try with different types of breaks\n\nWhat do you like?\n\nGames? Reading? Movies? Walks? Runns? Washing dishes? (what?!)\n\nThe important this is that the list goes on and on and it does not matter what you do, but just do it.\n\nEven a quick snack is an amazing way to refresh your brain with some nuts or fruit, depending on the time of the day maybe even a full meal.\n\nWhen do I know it is time for a break?\n\nIf it is difficult for you to get away from work, try setting an alarm for the amount of time you initially think would be optimal.\n\nAfter a couple of times, there is already going to be a mental note reminding you that you should rest.\n\nHow?\n\nOnce again, just give it in. It is not that hard and it would make a major difference.\n\nMy daily habits for better productivity\n\nHere are some of the activities that make my day pass quicker and make me more productive\n\nExercising\n\nThis type of activity is known to everybody, it relieves stress, recovers your mind and improves your health overall.\n\nWhen I am so stuck after hours of long thinking about something or even just have been doing something the whole day, a 45-minute exercise would be perfect for my wellbeing.\n\nYou are not a fan of running? Take a walk.\n\nWalking\n\nYou could argue that walks belong to the exercise section, but I could tell you otherwise. This type of break fills you with oxygen and rethinking something outside, could potentially get you to the solution.\n\nMeditating\n\nIt sounds like a very useless technique to have but it helps tremendously.\n\nRecollecting your thoughts is important as thinking about something,\n\nTry meditating for a couple of minutes per day and write down how you felt before and after, that way you will make yourself do it easier, but also find some results of this type of break.\n\nGames\n\nNothing extreme, just a casual mobile game, to get you distracted for a couple of minutes and then back at it again!\n\nBook\n\nWhatever genre and whichever book you like, it doesn\u2019t matter. Just relax during the reading that book of choice.\n\nBreathing\n\nThere are exercises that can help you get that oxygen into your body with the right way of breathing. You might think \u201coh I breathe just fine, thank you\u201d. Well try it and you might just find out how wrong you are.\n\nI found out about these from my mom when she was in therapy, so visit your doctor, because the internet is not always the best health resource you can find.\n\nSleep\n\nHave you heard that sleeping is humans superpower?\n\nWell, it is. Do not underestimate it. If you have time, you should most definitely relax and get at least 8 hours of sleep.\n\nOne more important thing to remember is that before sleep if you are trying to learn something repeat it one more time just before bed. Once you wake up, your brain would be like a sponge and you will be blown away by how much you remember.\n\nConclusion\n\nExtra breaks throughout the day won\u2019t hurt or make you slower. Once you integrate them into the daily routine, the boost you will feel in terms of the productivity will be growing every day after you start.\n\nGood luck and don\u2019t break too much!",

The siren calls of scale and flexibility tempt me, even as I have been scalded by my trust in you. As Airflow projects of the future loom, I am reminded constantly of the past. I hear the bellows of my projects booming in the wind. They call to me. Bound in irons. Doomed for eternity. They clasp and beg at me, asking:\n\n\u201cWhy did you think a dynamic mega-DAG was a good idea?\u201d\n\nI dismiss them as the nags of the past. I cannot give them the attention that they demand. I must focus on the future.\n\nEndeavours with Airflow require patience, research, wisdom. I read blog posts warning of anti-patterns and thought I knew better. So I dismissed them.\n\nI was a man of technology! I understood the risks of wielding my tools! The lessons of the blogs mattered naught. They fell on deaf ears.\n\nAnd so I began my work.\n\nFrom the beginning it was clear that Airflow was a strange beast. I created DAGS, operators, plugins, and began to consider myself an intermediate user. However I was just digging myself deeper and deeper into my Airflow hole.\n\nMy only way forward was to learn from my mistakes. Rethink Airflow. Share my findings.\n\nIn writing this blog post, my mind is returned to the Airflow projects that I have contributed to, sometimes even lead. I stare into a maelstrom of mistakes that I have made \u2014 all so obvious in retrospect. I am one of the unfortunate many that has battled and lost with Airflow.\n\nI have committed many sins against data engineering. It is through an introspection of these misgivings, that I may share my knowledge with you. I do this with the hopes of preventing future crimes against Airflow. So! Cast off your false assumptions of Airflow, for it is here and now that we shall discover how to avoid falling victim to its many pitfalls.\n\nSins of the past\n\nComplexity is where most of my Airflow transgressions began. By increasing the complexity of the Airflow instance, more could go wrong. When things did go wrong, they were harder to fix as I wasn\u2019t fixing just my code, I was fixing my code in Airflow. There comes no greater relief than that which is achieved through moving from a complex Airflow environment, to a lean Airflow environment.\n\nComplexity is bad. Debugging complex systems is worse.\n\nETL logic embedded in custom operators\n\nEmbedding ETL logic in Airflow is something which I\u2019ve seen too many times. Airflow supports custom python operators, allowing you to embed any kind of logic you choose into your Airflow DAGs. So why not empower Airflow with ETL logic, taking it from simple orchestrator of tasks to fully fledged data ingestion pipeline? Well, most of the time, this is asking for trouble.\n\nWhat happens when the logic exceeds the resources that are intended and allocated for it?\n\nHow do you test your logic? Must you engage Airflow to simply test some Python code?\n\nThe additional complexity of ELT logic inside of Airflow will lead you down the path of frustration when it comes to ensuring that the logic behaves as expected, is performant is terms of execution time, is testable, and so on.\n\nDynamic DAGs are cool, dynamic DAGs are a huge pain\n\nIt is almost a natural behaviour of those standing up Airflow and managing DAGs to try to make complex DAGs. Chief among these over-complexities is the dynamic DAG. This is often one DAG to rule all DAGs. One DAG that is influenced and directed by a metadata store outside of Airflow.\n\nThe dynamic mega-DAG.\n\nThis may seem like a great idea on its surface, you only have to write one DAG, which will do different things based on what the data dictates in the external metadata store.\n\nOnly one DAG! That\u2019ll be a dream to maintain!\n\nUnfortunately, the battle has already been lost. When something goes wrong with one of the jobs that is run through this pipeline, it is a living nightmare to debug it. A great amount of digging through logs is required in addition to endless navigation of the Airflow UI. The Airflow UI is not designed for this kind of behaviour.\n\nAirflow\u2019s UI provides pagination of DAGs. It provides the ability to search for DAGs by name. The UI is guiding you towards more DAGs, not less \u2014 definitely not one dynamic DAG to run all jobs.\n\nAirflow should be a fleet of small ships delivering packages, not one massive cargo ship.\n\nKubernetes is a great idea!\n\nKubernetes has had an influential effect on the global technology scene, and Airflow has been very much swept up in it. Indeed, Google Cloud\u2019s Airflow-as-a-Service offering is in fact Airflow running on a GKE cluster (together with a smattering of other services). The main problem with running Airflow on Kubernetes is a result of using Airflow in a non-Kubernetes way.\n\nAirflow has excellent support for Kubernetes by using their Kubernetes Executor (something that I recommend you look at if you are running Airflow on Kubernetes). However, using Airflow on Kubernetes with a non-Kubernetes Executor is a bit of a waste unfortunately. You gain all of the overhead of a Kubernetes cluster (together with the pain of managing, administering, governing, and securing it) with none of the benefits.\n\nWhy won\u2019t my plugins refresh?!\n\nThe process of refreshing plugin code is also a pain. Through a lot of trial and error, I have found that it takes restarting the scheduler and the webserver(s) in a certain order to properly replace the plugin code for a given Airflow instance. The errors given from Airflow often paint a very unclear picture of what is happening as a result of missing or erroneous code.\n\nThese reasons provide yet more ammunition for the idea of removing as much custom logic from Airflow as possible. If you can\u2019t reliably update the plugin code, the error reporting isn\u2019t great, and it\u2019s annoying to test\u2026why bother?\n\nKeep Airflow lean, its complexity low, and its DAGs and operators deterministic.\n\nBugs popping up in weird places because you changed plugin code? Welcome to Airflow!\n\nThe pathway to healing\n\nHaving reformed my usage of Airflow in recent days, let me offer some sage advice. The suggestions here will, again, lean heavily into the idea of lowering the complexity of the Airflow instance wherever possible. The more understandable and deterministic your systems are, the better you will sleep.\n\nAnti-patterns are real \u2014 constantly ask yourself if you are falling into their hands\n\nThere are plenty of warnings of Airflow\u2019s anti-patterns floating around in blog posts and documentation. Heed these warnings, do not ignore them, do not think of yourself as above such worries. I have been victim to slowly slipping into overly dynamic DAGs in the past, as I did not stop to consider \u2018is this an anti-pattern?\u2019 when making changes to my Airflow code.\n\nTalk to someone who has used Airflow heavily, and if possible share your instance\u2019s details. They will most of the time have some pearls of wisdom for you \u2014 and maybe a few war stories too.\n\nStop, take a breath and ask yourself: \u201cIs this an anti-pattern?\u201d. You\u2019d be surprised how easily you can fall into anti-pattern traps.\n\nStudy Airflow well, its strengths, and its weaknesses. Only then can you defeat it\n\nAirflow can be a particular beast. As I see it there may in fact be more anti-patterns in Airflow than patterns. When you can understand how it was intended to be used, you can use Airflow\u2019s strengths to make a great orchestration system.\n\nAbuse Airflow and you will be in a world of hurt.\n\nETL logic goes in scripts, call the scripts from Airflow\n\nI\u2019ve recounted above why ETL logic can really bog down Airflow, make it hard to test, unstable \u2014 a plain old bad place to be. The solution to this is to place your ETL logic somewhere outside of Airflow. Airflow itself offers solutions to this believe it or not. For Airflow running on a VM, there\u2019s BashOperator and DockerOperator. Both of these allow you to write and execute code in such a way that you can properly test the ETL code in isolation, away from Airflow. This is a huge benefit to you as an Airflow developer. Most of the time I would prefer Docker over Bash as you have more control over the execution environment, rather than running Bash locally.\n\nIf you are running Airflow on Kubernetes, then you also have an Airflow-native solution to removing custom code from Airflow \u2014 the KubernetesPodOperator.\n\nThe KubernetesPodOperator is an absolute shining gem. When it comes to removing custom logic from Airflow, Dockerising that logic and triggering it from Airflow is a great idea. To apply this to a Kubernetes world, you would spin out this docker-contained step into a pod, so that it is completely separate from the Airflow environment, maybe even running on a different machine!\n\nMake friends with your airflow configuration\n\nGood lord you can achieve a lot if you know what the Airflow configuration can do. It\u2019s an absolute mammoth of a file, and can be quite daunting to those just learning about Airflow. I urge you to experiment with the configuration \u2014 at least in a safe place where you don\u2019t mind blowing away the Airflow instance. I have a startling example of how important the Airflow configuration is to the behaviour of Airflow\u2019s jobs. An Airflow-on-Kubernetes cluster that I was managing was executing a given DAG to completion in 30 minutes. I noticed that each task was taking a tiny amount of time to complete, but there was a large amount of time that the DAG waited for the next task to be scheduled. Given enough fiddling with the configuration, the DAG was performing much better \u2014 it went from a 30 minute execution to just under 5.\n\nSuch a performance gain was achieved purely through tweaks to the Airflow configuration file. Consider that you may be able to speed up your jobs, improve stability, and even increase your resource utilisation just through experimenting with your Airflow configuration for a day or two. It\u2019s always worth a try.\n\nDecoding what the Airflow configuration variables do can be frustrating, but it is 100% worth the effort.\n\nKeep learning\n\nI\u2019d like to leave you, having confessed my sins and made reparations, with some further reading material that has helped me in my time with Airflow:\n\nAn excellent article broaching the topic of using container-based logic instead of embedded logic:\n\nhttps://medium.com/bluecore-engineering/were-all-using-airflow-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it-a56f14cb0753\n\nA post from Kubernetes itself about using Airflow on Kubernetes:\n\nhttps://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/06/28/airflow-on-kubernetes-part-1-a-different-kind-of-operator/\n\nA guide to scaling out Airflow (though it is an Astronomer-specific guide, it still has some great tips for all Airflow developers):\n\nhttps://www.astronomer.io/guides/airflow-scaling-workers/\n\nAn open (at the time of writing) issue with Airflow regarding their poorly named configuration variables \u2014 this is why I urge experimentation to properly understand the configuration:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-57\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you.

        "title": "Time Management is Killing Creativity",
        "text": "After Taylor\u2019s intervention, the workers who were moving only twelve tons of iron a day were now moving forty-eight tons of iron a day. They quadrupled their productivity.\n\nOnly a few decades before Taylorism, most people\u2019s concept of time was more closely linked to the movement of the sun than it was to the stopwatch hand. The availability of daylight, the height of a stalk of corn, or the day of first frost that signaled the coming of winter, ruled the work of farmhands.\n\nMany of Taylor\u2019s workers objected to having their movement so closely watched and timed, down to the second. Actually, more accurately than that \u2014 Taylor\u2019s stopwatch timed according to the hundredth-of-a-minute.\n\nBut, \u201cscientific management\u201d, as it was called, swept through the industrial world. Companies couldn\u2019t stay in business without adopting it.\n\nThe goal of Taylorism was to produce the most work possible in the minimum amount of time. As Taylor watched the movements of the workers, he was trying to reduce waste. He wanted each motion to be as quick and efficient as possible. He wanted each hundredth of a minute to bring the job closer to being done.\n\nBut, Taylor discovered there was a limit.\n\nLogically, there\u2019s no point in a worker sitting idle. Logically, if the worker keeps moving iron, he\u2019ll move more iron than the worker who stops for a smoke break.\n\nIntuitively, if you want to get the highest output possible out of the minimum amount of time, take your efficient movements, and fill all of the time with those movements.\n\nBut, Taylor discovered, it didn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe point of diminishing returns\n\nThere\u2019s a concept in economics called the point of diminishing returns. We can see the point of diminishing returns in action if we imagine Frederick Taylor filling the yard of Bethlehem Steel with workers.\n\nImagine Frederick Taylor has one worker moving iron in the yard of Bethlehem Steel. Thanks to following Taylor\u2019s prescribed movements, that worker is moving forty-eight tons of iron a day.\n\nThen, Taylor adds another worker. Now, the workers are moving ninety-six tons of iron a day. Taylor can keep adding workers, and the productivity in the yard will keep going up by forty-eight tons for each worker Taylor adds.\n\nUntil\u2026\n\nUntil they start to run out of space. There\u2019s just not as much room in the yard for the workers to pick up the iron, and move it from one place to another. They get in each other\u2019s way, they run into each other, or one worker will have to wait for another worker to finish his job before that first worker can finish his job.\n\nAt first, it\u2019s not a huge problem. Taylor has merely reached the point of diminishing returns. The point of diminishing returns is the point at which each additional production unit \u2014 in this case, the production unit is workers \u2014 each worker doesn\u2019t return as much benefit as the previous production units did. The return is diminishing.\n\nAt some point, Taylor adds a worker, and doesn\u2019t get an additional forty-eight tons of production. He gets only forty. Like I say, it\u2019s not a huge deal. They\u2019re still moving more iron than they were before they added that worker. Their margins are high enough on the labor costs that they\u2019re still making more profit.\n\nNow, let\u2019s apply this concept to a single worker. Only now the production unit isn\u2019t the workers themselves. The production unit is time. As Taylor filled the available time with motion, the output of a worker rose.\n\nBut at some point, Taylor hit the point of diminishing returns. As he filled the available time with efficient, optimized motion, at some point, the additional time filled didn\u2019t bring the returns that the previous units of time did. Maybe he tried instructing the worker to move three chunks of iron in ten minutes, then had no problem adding a fourth chunk of iron within that ten minutes. He could string together these ten-minute units, one after another. He could fill up a day with those units, and get the output he expected.\n\nBut then, at some point, moving an additional chunk of iron in that same unit of time didn\u2019t bring Taylor the returns he expected. In this case, let\u2019s say that number was five chunks of iron within ten minutes. Maybe the worker could keep it up for an hour, but soon the worker would get tired. Eventually, the worker couldn\u2019t move that fifth chunk of iron within a ten-minute unit. The worker got too fatigued. Taylor had reached the point of diminishing returns.\n\nThe point of negative returns\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the steelyard, where Taylor is adding workers. At some point after the point of diminishing returns, Taylor isn\u2019t getting forty-eight tons of output per additional worker, nor is he getting forty tons of output per additional worker.\n\nAt one point, workers were waiting for one another or getting in each other\u2019s way once in awhile. But now the yard of Bethlehem Steel is nearly gridlocked. The workers are constantly in each other\u2019s way. They\u2019re getting fatigued holding the chunks of iron. Injuries are skyrocketing. Productivity in the steel yard collapses.\n\nTaylor is way beyond the point of diminishing returns. Not only is he not getting the output he expected from adding an additional worker. That would be the point of diminishing returns.\n\nTaylor has now hit the point of negative returns. He\u2019s now getting less output overall per additional worker. For each worker Taylor adds, he\u2019ll get less output than he would have if that worker had just stayed home.\n\nCreative work is not industrial work\n\nScientific management is simple enough when you\u2019re moving chunks of iron. Simply experiment with the amount of iron moved in a given amount of time. Eventually, you\u2019ll find the right formula.\n\nBut creative work is different in a number of ways. There are three ways:\n\nOne: Some ideas are more valuable than others.\n\nTwo: It doesn\u2019t take time to have an idea.\n\nThree: In creativity, actions don\u2019t link to results.\n\nSome ideas are more valuable than others\n\nFirst, some ideas are more valuable than others. Imagine you write two 50,000-word novels, in parallel. Let\u2019s say you work equally as hard on the first novel as you do on the second novel. You spend just as much time typing the first novel as the second.\n\nThe first novel sells zero copies. The second one sells a million copies.\n\nThey\u2019re both free of misspellings. They\u2019re both quality writing. Why does one sell a million copies, while the other sells zero?\n\nIf the performance of the traditional publishing industry tells us anything, it\u2019s that nobody has any idea why one novel falls flat and the other takes off.\n\nBut, you can know this: Not all ideas have equal market value. In fact, the difference in market value, for the same amount of work, can be infinite.\n\nSo, words typed, while a worthy unit of output to track if you\u2019re trying to convince yourself you\u2019re a writer, is not the only thing to optimize for. The quality of ideas matters.\n\nIdeas don\u2019t take time\n\nThe second thing that makes creative work different from moving chunks of iron is that moving chunks of iron takes time.\n\nYes, all of the things leading up to having an idea take time \u2014 we\u2019ll talk about that next. But the act of having the idea takes no time at all.\n\nNeuroscientists can look at people\u2019s brains and give them a creative problem. The people can go from being nowhere near solving the problem, to solving the problem, in an instant.\n\nAgain, sitting yourself down and forcing yourself to come up with ideas is a worthy exercise. It will increase the output of ideas you have, it will build your skill in your craft, and it will increase the chances that one of those ideas is a hit.\n\nBut you may be just as likely to have that idea while not working at all. Remember Helmholtz\u2019s speech from episode 218, about the Four Stages of creativity? He said his ideas didn\u2019t tend to come to him \u201cat the writing table.\u201d\n\nThe moment of having an idea takes no time at all. Technically, you could have nearly unlimited ideas in a given \u201cproduction unit\u201d of time.\n\nActions aren\u2019t linked to immediate results in creative work\n\nNow, the third thing that makes creative work different from moving chunks of iron is that, in creative work, actions don\u2019t link to results.\n\nBy that I mean that if you grip a chunk of iron and pick it up off the ground, you have done work. You have moved that chunk of iron a little closer to its destination.\n\nCreative work doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nSay you have an idea for that novel that sells a million copies. Where did it come from?\n\nThink about Paul McCartney\u2019s song, \u201cYesterday.\u201d McCartney famously heard the melody for \u201cYesterday\u201d in a dream. At first, he was convinced it was a melody he had heard before. He thought it was an old Jazz tune his father had played when he was a kid.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u201d has stood the test of time as an original song. But musicologists have found numerous similarities to other songs.\n\nOne such song is called \u201cAnswer Me, My Love.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday\u201d\u2019s lyrics are as such:\n\nYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,\n\nNow it looks as though they\u2019re here to stay,\n\n\u201cAnswer Me, My Love\u201d\u2019s lyrics are as such:\n\nShe was mine yesterday,\n\nI believed that love was here to stay.\n\nMcCartney didn\u2019t steal from \u201cAnswer Me, My Love.\u201d But it\u2019s almost certain that he heard the song before. In 1953, when McCartney was eleven years old, a version of \u201cAnswer Me, My Love,\u201d by David Whitfield was the number one song on the UK charts.\n\nThen, it got knocked from the number-one spot \u2014 by another version of \u201cAnswer Me, My Love,\u201d this time, by Frankie Lane. It was the first time in UK pop chart history that a song was replaced by another version of itself.\n\nWas McCartney inspired by this song? It\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but it\u2019s certainly plausible.\n\nSo this idea you have for a novel that sells a million copies. Maybe you\u2019re in the right state of mind to have this idea because you took a vacation last month. Maybe you\u2019re more relaxed because you got a massage two days ago. Maybe you\u2019re thinking more clearly because you went on a hike earlier that day. Yet it was the funny red hat worn by the woman who walked by the cafe that sparked the idea. Meanwhile, it could have been inspired by some book, buried deep in your unconscious, that your mom read to you when you were three.\n\nWe\u2019re done with time management\n\nTaylorism was the birth of \u201ctime management.\u201d It was when we started to look at time as a \u201cproduction unit.\u201d\n\nWhen we look at time as a production unit, we assume that each additional unit of time we spend doing something will get us the same gain in output as the previous unit of time.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t work that way. Even in work as simple as moving chunks of iron, Taylor learned that human energy doesn\u2019t neatly pack together to fill all available time. We have our limits.\n\nToday, we\u2019re still treating time as a production unit. Our calendars are filled up with boxes, sometimes overlapping. Jason Fried calls it \u201ccalendar Tetris.\u201d We live according to that calendar.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only twenty-four hours in a day,\u201d you\u2019ll hear people say. The conclusion we\u2019re supposed to draw from that is that time is precious, so you better fill it all up.\n\nFilling up that time was a big leap forward, but now we need to draw a different conclusion. If there\u2019s only twenty-four hours in a day, that tells you there\u2019s a limit. That tells you that eventually, \u201ctime management\u201d is squeezing blood from a stone. When it comes to creative work, that stone is a very fragile stone, indeed.",

        "title": "Aspirin May Treat Severe Covid-19 Disease, and That Tells Us Something Important",
        "text": "Aspirin May Treat Severe Covid-19 Disease, and That Tells Us Something Important\n\nAspirin may turn out to be a cheap and effective way to save lives and prevent lasting damage\n\nBack in April, when the first wave of Covid-19 was crashing across the U.S., Michael Mazzeffi received an email from one of his colleagues at the University of Maryland Medical Center.\n\n\u201cOne of our surgeons said that when he was drawing blood out of a patient, it literally clotted within five seconds,\u201d says Mazzeffi, who is chief of the division of critical care anesthesiology. \u201cIt was pretty clear early on that patients with severe Covid had clotting disorders and that their blood was super coagulable.\u201d\n\nClinicians around the world noticed this same clotting phenomenon. By mid-summer, autopsies of people who had died from Covid-19 revealed that their vasculature and organs were often suffused with clots and coagulated blood. \u201cWhat we saw in the Covid ICU is that a lot of the patients would start developing a lot of clotting, and this high burden would lead to multi-organ failure and eventually death,\u201d says Jonathan Chow, MD, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nBecause clotting seemed to be a signature of severe or damaging Covid-19 disease, Chow and Mazzeffi started to discuss whether aspirin \u2014 a blood-thinning drug that can block the formation of clots \u2014 could help improve outcomes. \u201cAspirin is a very potent antiplatelet agent,\u201d Chow explains. Platelets are blood-cell fragments that, when activated, will clump together to form clots. \u201cAs soon as aspirin interacts with a platelet, that platelet becomes inactivated and can no longer participate in the clot-generating process,\u201d he says.\n\nFor a study published on October 21 in the journal Anesthesia and Analgesia, Chow and Mazzeffi \u2014 along with a multi-university team of researchers \u2014 examined the effects of aspirin among people hospitalized with Covid-19. After adjusting their data to account for age, BMI, race, preexisting conditions, and other variables that could muddy their conclusions, they determined that the risk of death or ICU admission was almost halved among people who got aspirin compared to those who did not.\n\n\u201cThis is now the second study linking blood thinners of some kind with improved outcomes,\u201d Mazzeffi says. \u201cI think it\u2019s driving home the point that an important part of the disease\u2019s process is clotting in the organs and that intervening in those pathways is something we should focus on.\u201d\n\nWhat this research tells us about the coronavirus\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, and the illness it causes is often described as primarily respiratory in nature. But that\u2019s turning out to be an oversimplification \u2014 especially for those who develop severe Covid-19 disease or symptoms that persist long after the initial infection has passed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole-body virus,\u201d says Girish Nadkarni, a doctor of internal medicine at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \u201cIt affects the kidneys, the brain, the blood vessels, and the heart. So it\u2019s not just a respiratory virus.\u201d\n\nThese anti-clotting and anti-inflammation benefits explain why plain old aspirin is such a widely deployed drug \u2014 and also why it may eventually prove helpful in treating Covid-19.\n\nIn July, Nadkarni and colleagues published a study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology that looked at the effect of anticoagulant drugs on outcomes among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Like the aspirin study that would follow a few months later, Nadkarni\u2019s study found that anticoagulants significantly reduced the risk of death among certain groups of people with Covid-19. \u201cWe found that both prophylactic and therapeutic doses of anticoagulation led to a lower risk of intubation and mortality,\u201d he summarizes.\n\nBoth his research and the aspirin study support the idea that \u2014 contrary to early assumptions \u2014 Covid-19 may be best characterized as a blood-vessel disease.\n\nFollow-up work and confirmation studies are needed. But Nadkarni says that the idea that a blood-thinning drug like aspirin could protect people from Covid-19 is credible. \u201cAspirin and anticoagulant drugs both prevent clots, albeit in slightly different ways,\u201d he explains. While aspirin shuts off the clot-forming activity of platelets, anticoagulant drugs act on clotting factors, which are proteins in the blood that help control the rate of bleeding.\n\nMany common and lethal illnesses \u2014 including diabetes, heart disease, and several others that are associated with a heightened risk for severe Covid-19 disease \u2014 also promote blood coagulation and clotting, Nadkarni says. And along with helping to prevent clots, aspirin also combats inflammation, which is implicated in a wide range of medical conditions. Together, these anti-clotting and anti-inflammation benefits explain why plain old aspirin is such a widely deployed drug \u2014 and also why it may eventually prove helpful in treating Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [SARS-CoV-2] creates this hypercoagulable state is really fascinating because few other respiratory viruses do that to the same degree,\u201d says Mazzeffi. He explains that there are specialized blood cells, called endothelial cells, that line the arteries, veins, and other blood-transporting vessels. \u201cThese endothelial cells maintain vascular integrity and help keep blood flow normal,\u201d he says. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 affects those cells and causes inflammation that may cause those cells to express things that cause clotting.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus and the disease states it causes are complex, he adds. But aspirin may turn out to be a cheap and effective way to save lives and prevent lasting damage.\n\n\u201cIf someone becomes ill [with SARS-CoV-2] and their doctor says it\u2019s safe for them to take aspirin, I think it\u2019s reasonable for them to take it.\u201d\n\nShould at-risk people consider taking aspirin?\n\nDoctors are usually hesitant to recommend a treatment that does not have a large body of evidence to support it. But Mazzeffi says that aspirin is such a familiar drug and its risks and safety profile are so well established that people who are exposed to the coronavirus may want to consider taking it in low doses.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about aspirin is that it\u2019s one of the best-studied drugs in the history of the Earth,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know it\u2019s not safe for everyone, but it\u2019s taken by literally hundreds of millions of patients, and it has a great safety record.\u201d\n\nThe greatest risk associated with aspirin is gastrointestinal bleeding. \u201cIf you have a history of peptic ulcers or bleeding from the stomach, then it may not be safe,\u201d he says. Also, his study didn\u2019t look at the effects of aspirin among children with SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 a group that already seems to be at low risk for severe Covid-19-related complications. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be popping aspirin in kids,\u201d he says.\n\nBut for most adults, taking a single low-dose (81 mg) aspirin pill each day for a period of a few weeks may be a low-risk, high-reward proposition.\n\n\u201cIf someone becomes ill [with SARS-CoV-2] and their doctor says it\u2019s safe for them to take aspirin, I think it\u2019s reasonable for them to take it,\u201d Mazzeffi says.",

        "title": "7 Ways Art Dissolves Writer\u2019s Block",
        "text": "Creativity and art are so important - I cannot stress it enough - to keep the world sane enough to survive, to keep our minds balanced. If more people allowed themselves to explore their creative, chaotic sides artistically, there would be less madness, less chaos out there. There would be more contentment. Art of any kind is a balm to the jaded soul.\n\nThat said, I had a bad state of depression this time last year, owing to life changes and adjustment issues. I was unable to write. My second novel got stranded and I simply could not out word after word. I avoided opening the manuscript file on my computer. I realized I had to work with my depression and as a creative person, as a writer, it was enough for me to be able to get back to my art. Writing often helps me get through low times but then, during depressive states, writing altogether took a backseat in my life. All the while, it just made me feel worse because I was not able to do the one thing that would lift me up \u2014 write.\n\nThat\u2019s when I kept coming across profiles of artists on Instagram. Artists working with acrylics and oil paints on canvas. I had been a fairly artsy kid and used to sketch a bit but never played with paint. I shied away from pursuing art and focused on writing. Then, I had this crazy idea \u2014 why not, just why not try painting? And I ordered acrylic paints, canvas panels and sheets, palette, palette knives, brushes, oil pastels and pastel papers.\n\nI painted in abandon and was surprised to find that it is something I trust myself to do. I painted my way out of depression. Four pictures in, I resumed writing my novel and completed the rest of it within two months. So, here\u2019s what art therapy at home taught me. An alternative form of art \u2014 here, I ventured with painting and it could be anything for you \u2014 dissolved my writer\u2019s block or whatever creative block I was experiencing.\n\nAn alternate path for creative energy to flow\n\nThe first realization I had was, it was essential to keep the flow. Creativity needs to be let out \u2014 be it words, colors, images or anything. When there is a block in the pipelines, you need to give it a shunt or a bypass. You need to open another valve and tap to let the waters out.\n\nAn excess of creative energy had accumulated in me, finding no outlet, while I was depressed. When I painted, I found the creative energy which was accumulated, clogged and fermenting in my brain was slowly being drained out. The alternate path for this creative energy to flow relieved the internal pressure and helped to lessen the guilty feeling of not helping myself. Healing came, slowly but steadily.\n\nUnleashing the internal chaos\n\nIf not through writing, I had to tell the world about the chaos in my head somehow. Through brush strokes, I was able to put the wrought-iron thoughts and feelings of worthlessness into colors. That meant something. Chaos is inherent to every creative soul and it has to be converted into something beautiful \u2014 poetry, stories, paintings, statues, crafts or songs.\n\nIt felt good to find that if not one, I had another way to unleash the confusion in my head, another way to convert the internal chaos into something enjoyable. Another way to tell my story.\n\nLiberate yourself\n\nThe very essence of art is the liberation enfolded into it. Art is a form of expression \u2014 there is no argument over that. Expression in any form is a discharge of thoughts, perceptions, and emotions. This is simply tipping a brimmed cup and letting out some of the fluid sloshings in it, freeing up space.\n\nPainting allowed me to tip over a cup of colors over the blank canvas, create something enjoyable and feel liberated to the extent of being ready to face the world again.\n\nPhoto by Amaury Salas on Unsplash\n\nRefreshing the brain and calming the soul\n\nWhile writing is a very active process, brainstorming and sequential thoughts being a part of it, knotting one thread with another, painting proved to be the opposite to me. While writing made my brain fatigue, painting calmed my soul. Writing is indeed something essential to me as long as I live, but I found that painting had a tranquilizing effect on a highly wired-up brain after writing. The unwinding effect of playing with colors and letting the brush swipe over the canvas and forming shapes and things was paramount.\n\nAfter a long episode of writing fervently, I would have pushed my limits. Painting allowed to soften the edges and let the soul take over. Painting was simply a conversation the soul had alone and unlike writing a story with many characters and lives, painting had only one destination \u2014 create something colorful on the canvas. There was no scope for a loophole when you are just painting to refresh and calm yourself.\n\nProductivity even during a creative block\n\nThe hardest thing to do when you are in a creative or writer\u2019s block is to be productive. Staying productive somehow is an ideal state to be in but often it is not possible. When I took up painting to heal, I discovered that productivity comes whenever you do something. It doesn\u2019t always have to be what you are meant to do, as long as you produce something. I allowed myself to forget about writing and indulge in painting, learning basics, and new techniques, learning about art supplies, watching painting videos on YouTube and my confidence in this new arena grew.\n\nI told myself, even if you cannot write, you can still be creative, you can still paint. And that opened up a whole new world for me. The moment I feel blocked, I stop pushing myself and take out the paints, including watercolors that I recently ventured with, and do something with it. Sometimes, it is the same kind of picture, sometimes entirely different. Sometimes, a gift for a loved one. The idea is to produce something and when it is achieved, I am no longer unproductive and non-creative. There is less guilt to handle. You would have done something creative and sometimes, that is enough to keep your spirits up, which is the first step to overcoming writer\u2019s block.\n\nTaking shifts\n\nPainting uses an altogether different center of our brain and a whole bunch of different neurons. Each form of art is different and requires a different set of neurons to work with. When we switch from one form of creativity to another, we are allowing the writing-brain to take a break and rest. Often procrastination is said to be the brain\u2019s way of taking a break and refreshing itself. We might as well use that time to engage other parts of our brain and do something we enjoy. Many writers love sketching, traveling, cooking or baking or many other hobbies. These allow the various parts of our brain to take shifts and let our main working part \u2014 the writing brain \u2014 to take the well-deserved rest.\n\nNew potential ideas\n\nWhen you embark on another creative art, you experience a whole different lifestyle. Even if it is for a short time, it counts as an experience and it is very likely to give you new potential ideas for your writing. For example, venturing with painting gave me the ideas and the experiences to write this article. But that\u2019s just one possibility. There are several. Art, after all, is opening a door to possibilities.",

        "text": "3 ways of using storytelling in design\n\nHow I rediscovered my favorite childhood activities.\n\nMe as a 5-year-old making stories\n\nAs a child, I loved creating stories. From the time I could hold a pencil, I would write little books and illustrate them. I continued doing this until my teenage years.\n\nBut when it came time to start looking at universities and choose a major, I decided to go for something related to art that would allow me to earn a steady income: I chose to work as a graphic designer. Unfortunately, I ended up in a role doing routine work and production design. While some people enjoy this type of work, I did not; I felt bored and stifled.\n\nIn an effort to move out of print production design, I went back to get a master\u2019s degree and ended up in the field of user experience design, stumbling into it mostly by accident. I loved that UX allowed me to talk with people, understand their needs, and help figure out what to create for them. I loved the impact that I could have on millions of people\u2019s lives and work experiences by designing better software products.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was that so much of my work would involve a return back to what I loved as a child: using images and words to tell stories.\n\nPages from a story I wrote and illustrated when I was young\n\nWhen I think about how I\u2019ve used storytelling in my role as a designer, it generally falls into three distinct categories:\n\nUsing storytelling to\n\nUnderstand and advocate for users Create lovable, user-friendly products Present a design vision\n\nIn this post I\u2019ll share examples with you of each of these. I hope it helps inspire you to tell more stories at work and possibly even reuse some of your favorite childhood skills.\n\nUsing stories to understand and advocate for our users\n\nOne of the ways that we understand our users is through talking with them \u2014 doing interviews or contextual inquiry. And one of the best ways I\u2019ve found to discover people\u2019s needs is to ask them to tell you a story. It\u2019s useful because it allows the participant to share what actually has happened in the past, rather than imagine what might happen in the future. It also allows you to follow up with questions about their emotions, goals, and beliefs behind their actions.\n\nCertain experiences will stand out more vividly in people\u2019s minds which makes them a good area of focus for stories. I will never forget this helpful (and rhyming) phrase that Jeff Patton shared in a workshop which he led a few years ago:\n\n\u201cPeople remember the last time, the first time, the best time, and the worst time.\u201d\n\nFor example, you can ask about the first time someone logged into your product, the last time they had to contact customer support, the best or worst experience they\u2019ve had with online shopping, etc.\n\nAfter people have told us their stories, we then can use storytelling to engage our teams back in the office and advocate for our users. Stories with a conflict, an emotional arc, and a resolution will get your audience\u2019s attention and help them remember the main idea later.",

        "text": "Execute\n\nAll the dreaming and planning in the world won\u2019t mean anything if you never put the rubber to the pavement. Within EXECUTE, successful entrepreneurs:\n\nDo\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs don\u2019t overplan to the point of paralysis. Sometimes a little uncertainty can leave some good room for creativity. But despite all of the doing, you have to remember that your most important customer is your current paying customer! Take good care of the customers who already support you.\n\nKeep a Calendar\n\nYou have better chances for productivity and efficiency if you organize your day before the day begins. Of course, there will be interruptions, but it\u2019s better to have a course designed as opposed to \u201cfreestyling\u201d it all day.\n\nKeep a Checklist\n\nThis is the next progression from keeping a calendar. Turn your tasks on your calendar into smaller attainable action items and mark them off upon completion. This is one of those things that separate successful entrepreneurs from the pack. Your checklist can be on paper or in digital form. The point is to have a way to track your productivity.\n\nDelegate\n\nYou can\u2019t do it all. Find some people around you to execute the tasks that you can\u2019t do or get to in a timely fashion. Also, you\u2019re not great at all things. Try to only delegate tasks to people who can do the task better (or at about the same level) and faster than you can.\n\nMeasure\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs always know where they stand with their key performance metrics/indicators. KPIs include things like phone calls made or emails sent, meetings secured, deals closed, product returns (the lower the better), or homes shown (for my real estate agent friends).\n\nPivot\n\nFailing fast and moving on isn\u2019t always a good idea. Sometimes it takes a few tries in order to successfully execute on a business idea. With that said, successful entrepreneurs know how to make the proper tweaks to their marketing plan, business model, and/or product or service offering in order to get their business on the right track.\n\nPersevere\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs are in it to win it and they won\u2019t let a few bumps in the road deter them from their goal(s). Some failure is temporary and success sometimes comes down to how well and how often you get up after getting knocked down.",

        "text": "Writing in the Stolen Moments\n\n4 strategies to help you keep writing even in busiest times\n\nCredit: Adobe Stock\n\nOften, you will hear writers complain that they don\u2019t have any time to write when, in fact, they mean they don\u2019t have the perfect confluence of time and solitude to sit and bang out a few hundred words in one sitting. Many times, you\u2019ll see someone post on social media that they just can\u2019t find the time to write anymore, followed by a post in which they talk about all the shows they\u2019ve binge-watched on Netflix.\n\nSeriously? If you have time to binge-watch programs on Netflix or Amazon Prime, you have time to write. And if you don\u2019t write despite having time to binge-watch shows, no amount of justification of your inaction to others will ever help.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar, start by jettisoning one phrase from your lexicon, it is this: \u201cI just can\u2019t find time\u2026\u201d No one \u201cfinds\u201d time. Time is not like some loose change we discover fallen behind the pillow on your sofa. We \u201cmake\u201d time, or we \u201csteal\u201d time. Or we use the time in a way that may not be optimal, but is time nonetheless.\n\nI myself often feel the temptation to justify my own dry periods by saying things like \u201cWell, I had too much to do this week. I just didn\u2019t have time to go sit in a coffee shop for a whole morning.\u201d I have to repeatedly remind myself that I do not need to wait until I have both time and an idea to sit down and write something. Anything.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is to always have your journal with you, or at least a small notepad or a few sheets of notepaper. It helps to be prepared for any periods in which you are forced to sit and wait for any length of time: in your car waiting to pick up your child from sport/music/dance lessons, in line at the post office the week before Christmas, or even in the waiting room at your doctor\u2019s office. Steal those moments for your writing.\n\nThe following three strategies are ones that I always have to fall back on. They serve as reminders that even 5, 10, or 20 minutes is enough time to put pen to paper and hone a few writing skills.\n\n1. Practice descriptions\n\nLook around you. What do you notice? Practice noticing the smallest details about people or places around you. Do a character study or portrait. Invent a backstory to the person sitting across from you. What is their life like? How did they start their day? Oh, they have a scar \u2026 where did they get that?\n\nHere\u2019s a great example of a description from the novel Q&A by Vikas Swarup:\n\n\u201cDelhi\u2019s Juvenile Home diminished us, but Dharavi\u2019s grim landscape of urban squalor deadens and debases us. Its open drains teem with mosquitoes. Its stinking, excrement-lined communal latrines are full of rats, which make you think less about the smell and more about protecting your backside. Mounds of filthy garbage lie on every corner, from which rag-pickers till manage to find something useful. And at times you have to suck in your breath to squeeze through its narrow, claustrophobic alleys. But for the starving residents of Dharavi, this is home.\u201d\n\n2. Practice similes\n\nSometimes I like to give my imagination a workout with simple sensory exercises. What sound do you hear? What is making that sound? If you already know the source of a sound, think of all the other things (real and imagined) that could also make that sound. What about smells? What about things you can touch with your eyes closed?\n\nHere\u2019s an example from John Irving\u2019s children\u2019s book, A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound:\n\n\u201cIt sounded like a monster with no arms and no legs, but it was trying to move \u2026 It was a sound like, in the closet, if one of Mommy\u2019s dresses came alive and it tried to climb down off the hanger \u2026 It was a sound like someone pulling the nails out of the floorboards under the bed \u2026 It was a sound like a ghost in the attic, dropping the peanuts it had stolen from the kitchen \u2026 It was a sound like someone trying not to make a sound.\u201d\n\n3. Practice rhyming\n\nLook around you or, perhaps, pick up a magazine, open a random book. What\u2019s the first word you see? Write it down. Then write down all the words you can think of that rhyme with the original word. Start with one syllable then work up to two, three, four, or more. This easy exercise will help you to bring forward in your mind words that you do not typically use, so that they will be at-the-ready the next time you are in full-on writing mode.\n\n4. Revise your drafts\n\nRevision is also writing. If you have an article, blog post, essay, short story, or poem that you\u2019ve been working on, print it out and carry it around with you. Use your stolen moments as a chance to deep dive into the revision or editing process. Here are a couple of ideas that closely relate to the old saying, \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d This means showing your reader images that help them understand how \u201csad\u201d a situation is, instead of simply telling them, \u201cIt was such a sad situation.\u201d\n\nExamine your verb choices.\n\nWhen you find yourself using a lot of adverbs to bolster your verbs, this means the verb you chose may be weak. Use your stolen moments to figure out a visual way of showing the way that the verb is being performed. For example:\n\nHe walked very slowly \u2014 You can strengthen this by saying something like \u201cHis feet moved as if they had weights tied to them.\u201d\n\nThe car drove quickly down the street \u2014 You can strengthen this by saying something like \u201cThe car sped down the street.\u201d\n\nPrices rose sharply \u2014 You can strengthen this by saying something like \u201cPrices skyrocketed.\u201d\n\nWatch out for abstract nouns and adjectives\n\nNouns such as \u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d are abstract, as are the adjectives associated with them \u2014 \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cjust.\u201d Readers can\u2019t see beauty or hear justice. What they can see or hear are concrete examples of these things. In your writing, try to avoid abstract nouns in favor of giving your readers examples that will illustrate something that is \u201cjust\u201d or something that is \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\nAnother good rule is to avoid reliance on adjectives that require judgement, such as \u201cdark,\u201d \u201cdeep,\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d How dark is dark? Is it as dark as the bottom of a well? Or is it as dark as tar melting under an August sun? How deep is deep? Is it as deep as a thimble? Or is it as deep as the gaping mouth of the Grand Canyon? How strong is strong? Is it as strong as the coffee that\u2019s been left for five hours on the burner? Or is it as strong as the memory of your first kiss?\n\nNot everyone can put their jobs on hold for two weeks to head to a writer's residency. But, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t take the time to write. Even a brief exercise like one of those listed above has the innate potential to bring forward a line or two that just might be the beginning (or end) to a new story, essay, or poem.",

        "title": "Tech Diaries: Apple\u2019s Reinvention, Starlink launch & Microsoft\u2019s Pivot towards Blockchain",
        "text": "Tech Diaries: Apple\u2019s Reinvention, Starlink launch & Microsoft\u2019s Pivot towards Blockchain\n\nApple enters Digital Payments, Global Streaming Internet by SpaceX & Microsoft\u2019s Blockchain Projects\n\nWelcome to the first edition of Tech Diaries \u2014 my new blogging series about important issues pertaining to the tech world. For those you who have across my other blogs, I have a similar edition called Crypto Diaries which pertains mainly to Cryptocurrencies & Blockchain. So without further delay, let\u2019s dig into the Tech World.\n\nApple Card\n\nI still remember how excited I was when I got the first edition of the iPhone years ago. Apple brought in a revolution with its smartphone devices. Over the years, Apple has become one of the biggest & most valuable brand names in the World. It is one of the elite members of the tech group dubbed as GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple).\n\nLast year, Apple was the first of the big four to hit the $1 trillion mark valuation followed by Amazon & most recently Microsoft. Market correction recently has brought down the valuation of these companies from the highs, but all four of them are still within touching distance of that coveted prize.\n\nComing back to Apple, the strong growth over the years has been spearheaded by its flagship product \u2014 the iPhone. While Korea\u2019s Samsung & Chinese Huawei have squeezed Apple\u2019s smartphone market share, but a loyal customer base has been Apple\u2019s biggest prize.\n\nFor years iPhone printed money for Apple but with increased competition & squeezing gross margins, Apple\u2019s growth began to stall around 2016. This was about the time when they realized that stagnating innovation & higher-priced phones were not going to spur the growth.\n\nThey needed to diversify into something which can outlast the shine on the brand new iPhone. Services like Apple Music, App Store purchases, iCloud subscriptions, as well as new products such as the Apple Watch, AirPods and the HomePod have given a new lease of life to the dwindling revenue of the company. The most important announcement yet in this tilt towards subscription services came in March when Apple announced the launch of the Apple card.\n\nThe latest innovation from Apple is a digital payment system with the conveniences customers desire \u2014 No late fees, No wait to qualify, Cash backs of up to 3% & No long strings of numbers! While its tech counterpart Facebook mulls over developing its own digital payment system for its social media empire, Apple has already taken the first step towards the future of money.\n\nAnd the one thing that Apple has an abundance of that Facebook doesn\u2019t is the trust factor of its client base. Apple is basically enhancing the user experience by providing interactive tools & charts in the Daily Cash App to track your balances, cash-backs, payments, expenses, etc. This will strengthen its ever-growing ecosystem of Apps, services & hardware even further.\n\nApple has also promised not to eavesdrop on your spending habits \u2014 a believable claim considering there haven\u2019t been any data breach scandals, unlike its contemporaries FB & Google which are much more reliant on third-party advertisements for their revenue generation, not to forget their data breaches!\n\nEndeavors like this are shaping how the future of money looks like & this summer we will find out how Apple Card is received by consumers. There is a small catch though \u2014 are you willing to buy a $1000 smartphone to access all this?\n\nGlobal Internet\n\nI respect Elon Musk as a true visionary of our times, despite his tweeting rants and his occasional pot smoking podcasts. Companies like Tesla, Solar City, SpaceX, Hyperloop, OpenAI, Neuralink are the brainchild of this genius. His financial troubles, especially at Tesla, maybe a topic for another day.\n\nBut for now, SpaceX is launching the first batch of 60 satellites today for the company\u2019s Starlink project \u2014 an endeavor to provide broadband internet service to the global population by beaming it from the satellites positioned in the low-Earth orbit (LEO).\n\nThese satellites can basically beam the internet to anywhere on the globe. To achieve this kind of global connectivity, a constellation of about 12,000 satellites would be needed eventually. The network of satellites would be communicating with each other via lasers and will deliver 40 times faster internet that current satellite service by employing Ku/Ka-band broadband.\n\nThe Falcon 9 will be launching the first batch of satellites later today. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin is planning a similar project called \u2018Project Kuiper\u2019 where 3,236 satellites would be used to provide a global broadband internet service, which would be launched via its new New Glenn rocket in 2021. Either way, these are significant steps towards bridging the global digital divide. Bravo!\n\nThe critics, however, argue that kind of massive satellite deployment is going to aggravate the burgeoning space junk problem that we are dealing within the Earth\u2019s orbit. Scientific American states a worst-case scenario can trigger \u201c Kessler syndrome \u201c \u2014 triggering a cascade of space debris which would trap humans on Earth.\n\nSpaceX defended the action by saying that the satellites will be orbiting in a much lower orbit keeping them out of range of the current space debris in higher orbit & also easier to retire once they have outlived their usefulness \u2014 which will happen after 5 years, according to NASA. Let\u2019s look at the bright side\u2026 Shall we?\n\nMicrosoft affinity to Blockchain\n\nMicrosoft has evolved tremendously from being largely a software producer of its Windows operation system which controlled the majority of the computer systems around the World in the \u201990s. The gradual shift towards services under the dynamic leadership of its current CEO Satya Nadella has given it a new innovative spirit backed by strong growth. As you can see the company\u2019s rock-solid performance evident from the charts above.\n\nThe important thing to note is that of the $110.36 billion in revenue in 2018, $27.6 billion or almost a quarter of it came from its Microsoft Azure Cloud service. Talking about its Azure Cloud service \u2014 the platform has started to take a liking towards blockchain over the past year with the releases of its blockchain development kit and the Azure Blockchain Workbench.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the company released Azure Blockchain Services \u2014 a full managed BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) platform that allows the formation, management & governance of the consortium blockchain networks. The release also supports other advanced tools for its developers including AI, mixed reality, IoT. This came on the heels of Amazon launching its own BaaS platform \u2014 Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB).\n\nMore recently, the Seattle-based tech giant also announced that it is building a decentralized identity (DID) network on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The open standards infrastructure, known as the Identity Overlay Network (ION) will give control of data to the users backed by decentralized networks while enabling privacy & security at the same time.\n\nThe main net for the platform will be launched in the coming months. These moves by tech giants signal a move towards broader blockchain adoption & bode well for the future of this technology.\n\nBefore wrapping up, just a quick recap with what\u2019s happening with Huawei \u2014 the Chinese tech giant. With the trade war escalation, U.S has just announced broad-based curbs on the company. The move would effectively stop American companies from using Huawei\u2019s equipment or providing it with any essential supplies. The company which is already facing severe challenges with the roll-out of its 5G networks globally in the face of American opposition could be headed for more trouble.\n\nEmail \ud83d\udced| Twitter \ud83d\udcdc | LinkedIn \ud83d\udcd1| StockTwits \ud83d\udcc9 | Telegram \ud83d\udd17",

        "title": "Letting Go of Diagnoses Improved My Mental Health",
        "text": "Letting Go of Diagnoses Improved My Mental Health\n\nAnd it just might work for you, too.\n\n2017 was a really bad year for me. I ringed in the New Year in a psychiatric facility, and though my time there was brief, it led to a circus that included a new psychiatrist and a whole bunch of new medication. Along with that circus came a bunch of diagnoses I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before, which included:\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder (BPD)\n\nBipolar Disorder\n\nSeasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\nFor years, I was treated with Lithium, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, Lamictal, Abilify, Doxapine, Trazodone, Latuda, and others. At any given time, I was on four to six different antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood-stabilizing, and anxiety-reducing medications at once. For a few brief years, I was a shell of myself hiding behind the cocktail I was prescribed.\n\nSadly, I let this go on for so long because I was allowing my diagnoses to define me. Behind every thought, word, and action that comprised my being, there were my mental illnesses. In any given day, I had a panic attack (PTSD), I dissociated frequently (BPD, PTSD), had some kind of a tantrum due to my unstable sense of self (BPD), and had an intense mood swing that brought me back up on my feet and feeling like I was on top of the world (Bipolar Disorder).\n\nAfter three and a half painstaking years, I found myself with a new psychiatrist whose prescriptions were minimally invasive and whose thoughts on my prior diagnoses were a bit different than that of what I was used to.\n\nShe firmly believed that my BPD would improve over time and assured me that my condition should be first treated by therapy as the main course of action \u2014 she assured me that medication should be a boost and not the go-to solution for my conditions. I found a great therapist due to her, and with my new lifestyle as a person who was no longer over-medicated, I began to slowly but surely thrive.\n\nEven my new therapist barely mentioned the names of my disorders to me when we were combing through the tangled messes that my maladies often left me with. She didn\u2019t think of me as a diseased or disabled person \u2014 she just thought of me as a person. Being treated so differently than I had been from the team of doctors linked to the hospital was utterly refreshing and revitalizing.\n\nNow, after years of feeling like a zombie, I was clear again. I still relied on medication to help prevent me from tipping into psychosis and other problematic states, and especially relied on it to help me through my night terrors and other sleep problems, but now I wasn\u2019t over-medicated. Slowly but surely, I began to see myself as more than my diagnoses and to feel a greater sense of command over my body now that I wasn\u2019t numb from the consequences of being treated like a sickly person.\n\nThe search for mental wellness is not always easy. I know this firsthand. Now that I have a better team of mental health professionals around me, I feel a sense of support that goes beyond medication. I feel that I suffered for so many years for a good reason and that the suffering I felt at the beginning of my wellness journey was very important in being able to lead a happy life now.\n\nIs my life perfect now that I\u2019ve stopped over analyzing my diagnoses? No.\n\nIn fact, some of those very words \u2014 like BPD \u2014 saved my life. Without my Borderline diagnosis, I would have never discovered Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), perhaps the greatest tool I have for everything from emotional regulation to distress tolerance. Diagnoses are important and do not need to be overanalyzed to the point of becoming a limitation. They tell professionals how to get us the best help possible based on decades of research.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with a diagnosis, you are not alone. There is a way of acknowledging an illness without allowing it to consume us. I believe that over time, finding wellness becomes easier and we must learn graciously from the trial and error that comes with medication, therapy, and other tools to live our best lives.",

        "title": "What Story Can You Tell That Only You Could?",
        "text": "What Story Can You Tell That Only You Could?\n\nYou Have No Idea Who is Waiting On Your Story\n\nThis question has bothered me for weeks. The easy deflection I could come up with is that I should just keep writing and the story will tell itself. However, as I study better writers \u2014 especially here on Medium- I realize that this blind dive can only help for so far.\n\nThen, you hit a wall.\n\nYour writing becomes a rehash of everything you\u2019ve said and when you try to \u201ccopy\u201d others in the hope of improving, your voice airs like Frankenstein\u2019s dirty, electric, underwear.\n\nThat\u2019s why the question is becoming key in my process.\n\nI am taking a writing course that\u2019s forcing me to pause and really understand what \u201cgood writing\u201d is. I\u2019m reading popular articles and taking note of what certain pieces make me feel \u2014 especially trying to crack the elusive \u201cheadline code\u201d.\n\nIn all this, I know I won\u2019t improve in a few months. I know I will need to write and test and keep showing up.\n\nTaking the time to reflect on this question does not remove the work required.\n\nPhoto by bruce mars on Unsplash\n\nWhat changed?\n\nWriting happened organically for me. I wasn\u2019t really outspoken as a child. I wasn\u2019t popular for anything ( except wearing glasses and having multiple surgeries which made sure while all my school mates did mandatory manual labor in boarding school, I had to watch from the sidelines because I was labeled \u201ca patient\u201d).\n\nThe thoughts I carried never had a way out. I can\u2019t remember anyone even urging me to start a blog. It was the most natural thing.\n\nAs I shared my heartbreak stories, poetry, and cringe-worthy fiction, I grew an audience of people who knew me personally and actually enjoyed what I wrote. I would meet people who gave me compliments and said it was really good.\n\nIt was nice to hear but didn\u2019t mean much.\n\nFast forward a few years of this, a couple of jobs I hated, moving to the US, getting married and \u201cgrowing up\u201d, now this innocent love for writing has become something else \u2014 something I want to do with the rest of my life.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain balance to making such decisions, I have come to realize: if you push too much, you become stubborn to necessary changes. For example, if I think I have innate talent and can\u2019t learn much from a writing course or a book, then I am doomed to fail this life goal.\n\nOn the other hand, if I don\u2019t take this seriously enough; if I don\u2019t invest the time and effort required \u2014 I won\u2019t improve on the existing skill, nor would I learn the ancillary skills needed to thrive as a writer in this age.\n\nIt\u2019s the balance that begs the question.\n\nA story ( or stories) only I could write, guarantee the unique nature of my value proposition to the world. But this story, if poorly told, doesn\u2019t move the dilemma.\n\nPhoto by Dariusz Sankowski on Unsplash\n\nThe first step is to identify the story.\n\nWhat will I write about? Why does it matter? Who is it for?\n\nThe next step, obviously, is to tell the story.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way to say it? How can I tell it in such a way that no one else could such that it will be truly mine?\n\nWe all know a friend who knows how to tell the best stories. When something happens and he/she is present, we don\u2019t mind telling them to narrate what happened because we know they\u2019re good at it.\n\nEveryone is good at something. We all have something inside that we naturally gravitate towards and that calls us to make \u2014 a calling.\n\nThe difficulty I have \u2014 which I think most people do \u2014 is finding that balance between working blindly on your calling and getting help.\n\nBetween telling the same stories and changing things up. Between rehashing personal life anecdotes and digging deeper.\n\nI once read somewhere that in order to be a writer, you have to live a full life. That your stories will come from living. There\u2019s a lot of truth in this.\n\nYet, as we\u2019re all holed up at home and working remotely, I wonder how much of life we\u2019re living. I wonder if this confinement isn\u2019t the trigger we needed to realize that life doesn\u2019t have to mean physical travel or seeing places.\n\nThat maybe, just maybe, we have more stories in us than we\u2019ve dared to explore.\n\nAs I consider this, I realize that yes, I may have written about the heartbreak, but I never delved deeper into how that changed me or affected the way I now behave in my relationship.\n\nI may have written about my fresh experience in the US, but not about how I no longer associate myself with the label \u201cimmigrant\u201d.\n\nI may have mentioned my highschool years weren\u2019t fun, but I\u2019ve never explored how the culture set me- and others \u2014 up to be unprepared for real-life problems with many of us unemotionally mature enough to deal with many things.\n\nPhoto by Dawid Zawi\u0142a on Unsplash\n\nThere\u2019s more than meets the eye, yo.\n\nThere are so many stories we have inside of us, waiting to be called out. Because we\u2019re not still enough \u2014 not willing to sit with our thoughts \u2014 or not willing to engage in deeper thought and journaling, we \u201cwaste\u201d stories that could otherwise be valuable to others.\n\nSo, when I ask this question, what story could you write that no one else could: it doesn\u2019t mean the next Harry Potter. It doesn\u2019t mean working on a story until it\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d or waiting until you feel like a writer before you write.\n\nNo.\n\nIt means going inside, finding a truth you have that you may not have articulated, then sharing to the best of your abilities.\n\nThis will require shedding your ego \u2014 as you learn how to do this better.\n\nIt will require learning from others, undoing bad storytelling habits.\n\nKeyphrase: best of your abilities.\n\nIt may mean writing about topics you\u2019ve never considered ( I\u2019m writing a piece on better decision making and scared shitless about how \u201cunme\u201d it sounds. I request feedback from a writing partner who knows more on the subject and his pointers were invaluable).\n\nThe price of being a better storyteller involves being willing to find your voice beyond the ego, beyond what you know to be \u201cyou\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re all changing and the way we perceived \u201clove\u201d or \u201cmoney\u2019\u2019 a few years \u2014 even months ago \u2014 isn\u2019t the way we do now.\n\nThat story? That evolution you\u2019ve achieved? That\u2019s unique to you.\n\nThe world needs this story to know it\u2019s possible to evolve.\n\nYou have no idea who is waiting on your story \u2014 the story only you could tell.\n\nDon\u2019t second guess yourself. Open that new document and start.\n\nYou have it in you to tell beautiful stories. I know this. You know this. You wouldn\u2019t be fighting so hard to be better if you didn\u2019t.\n\nWe want to hear from you \u2014 the story only you can tell. Because there\u2019s no one who has lived the life you live.\n\nTap into that. Spend time with yourself. Practice more, try different things. Free yourself from the pain of tying your ego to any such feedback, use everything to grow and become a better storyteller.\n\nBecome yourself.",

        "title": "Make A Plan for When You Want to Give Up Writing",
        "text": "Find the Time to Write\n\nI am an advocate for anyone being able to find the time to write. I even wrote a book on writing that included how to do this, and I have various articles talking about it, but wow, life seems to have got me this time. All my usual tricks aren\u2019t working. I feel like I\u2019m ready to give up and that maybe I\u2019m just not cut out to be a working writer.\n\nI\u2019ve tried getting up at 5 am to write or working in the evening to get some words done. I\u2019ve even taken up using dictation in hope to be able to get words on the go, but the more I do to enable myself a good amount of writing time, the harder life seems to make it for me actually to get to my desk.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t dealing with ill-health of elderly family members and new babies being born into my family, it\u2019s my children needing help with things in their life. I joke, to my friends who say they can\u2019t wait for their children to grow up, that it gets worse. But it isn\u2019t really a joke. Bigger kids means bigger problems.\n\nI\u2019m not complaining about these things. I care for my father\u2019s mother. I cared for my father before he died. I have four children, they have their own children, and being a big family means we all muck in together to help each other out. It\u2019s fantastic we have that family support, but it can\u2019t half take my time up.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that pandemic. I know my wife and I aren\u2019t alone in how the pandemic has affected us. My wife runs a wedding business, and so with all weddings being cancelled, she\u2019s had to find other work, and I\u2019ve been needed to help with that.\n\nAs a consequence, finding time to write or do anything has been near impossible. But I\u2019m trying.",

        "text": "Have you ever published something and gotten a resounding echo in response? Nobody read your article, the editor rejected your book, or you sold one lonely e-book?\n\nWhat went wrong? You thought your writing was interesting, structured properly, and your grammar was correct. I\u2019ve had this happen, and it sucks!\n\nI\u2019ve learned to ask this essential question, \u201cWhy should my reader care about what I\u2019ve written?\u201d\n\nThe answer, \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s good,\u201d or \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s funny, interesting, or educational,\u201d won\u2019t work.\n\nNext question. \u201cHow do I discover what my reader cares about?\u201d\n\nMost of my writing is for business blogs and websites. I must know what my reader is interested in. If not, I\u2019m wasting my time and my client\u2019s hard-earned money.\n\nThere are tools you can use to find out what your reader wants, to understand what they crave, and get familiar with them. I will show you how to do just that.\n\nThis reader can be called a profile, a persona, or an avatar, but it\u2019s an image of one person in your audience.\n\nWhen you have a thorough understanding of who your reader is and what they hope to read, you will also be able to market to them \u2014 a huge bonus!\n\nThe vast majority of products are sold because of the need for love, the fear of shame, the pride of achievement, the drive for recognition, the yearning to feel important, the urge to look attractive, the lust for power, the longing for romance, the need to feel secure, the terror of facing the unknown, the lifelong hunger for self-esteem and so on. \u2014Gary Bencivenga, legendary copywriter.\n\nWe won\u2019t be successful if we make assumptions about our readers. We\u2019ve got to know what problems they are trying to solve.\n\nHere, I\u2019ll use one of my own projects as an example.\n\nHere are a few projects on my list.\n\nI\u2019m working on an informative blog post about gardening for Medium.\n\nHow to Start Your First Vegetable Garden, a full-length book.\n\nOutline a 2,000-word article I hope to sell to Organic Gardening magazine.\n\nA Texas seed company hired me to produce a 900-word piece on the best vegetable varieties for Central Texas.\n\nI\u2019m working on the beginning gardener book first since it requires the most research, and I can use what I learn for the other projects.\n\nI need to get a clear picture of a typical reader for my book.\n\nThis will be a fictional composite person based on research. Think of it as developing a backstory, just as you would for a character in a novel.\n\nSo who would my imaginary gardener be?\n\nStep # 1: I start with some simple Google searches for my high-level questions, including a date.\n\nGoogle: Who spends the most money on gardening 2020?\n\nI\u2019m guessing that a group spending money on their hobby would be a likely buyer for my Basics of Starting Your First Vegetable Garden book.\n\nAs I scroll down and I see a comprehensive report titled 2020 National Gardening Survey. However, it costs $1200.00, more than I want to spend!\n\nNext, I find an article titled State of the Industry 2020, published by Garden Center magazine. Not too many specifics here, but I note this promising statement, \u201cWith the resurgence of victory gardening in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and high unemployment rates, edibles saw the biggest growth this year.\u201d\n\nGoogle: What age are the people gardening at home?\n\nAn article titled Why the 20\u201330 Somethings Are Gardening tops the page.\n\n\u201cAlthough food gardening, in general, is up 17% in the past 5 years and still growing, the rate is up by 63% among ages 18\u201334, according to a new study by the National Gardening Association.\u201d\n\nI list points from the article:\n\nThese new gardeners are looking for \u2018real\u2019 and \u2018non-virtual\u2019 things in their lives.\n\nThey worry about the security of the food supply.\n\nGardening is a hobby to share with their children.\n\nThey have small yards and are interested in container gardening.\n\nWhile interested in organic growing, they lose patience with complicated instructions.\n\nThis is beneficial information I can use!\n\nI decide my new gardener is Ryan, 32 years old, and he works as a software developer.\n\nPhoto by Austin Paquette on Unsplash\n\nStep # 2: Many big tech companies are downtown, so I imagine Ryan living within biking distance of downtown. I am familiar with a vegan restaurant in the area, and so I put him living in zip code 78704.\n\nEnter the zip code at https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/ to pull up the basic demographic information.\n\nMedian household income of $51,00.00\n\nMost people live in rental homes\n\n84% single, 12% have children\n\nEducation level: 50% graduated college\n\nRyan rents a single-family house on Monroe St. with his friends Renae and Anthony.\n\nPhoto by Phil Hearing on Unsplash\n\nStep # 3: Next, I go to the global demographic site, Esri. Fortunately, we can gain a lot of spending and lifestyle information from their free services.\n\nEnter a zip code to get reports on area residents. They tell me that the three groups of residents in this area are the Young & Restless, Emerald City, and Metro Renters.\n\nI decide Ryan fits in the Emerald City group, so I gather information from that report to combine with the other facts I\u2019ve collected (and imagine) about him.\n\nRyan balances long hours on the computer with biking and working out at the gym. He embraces the \u2018foodie\u2019 culture and enjoys cooking adventurous meals using local and organic foods to share with his friends.\n\nHis slightly shabby rental house was built in 1946. The landlord lets Ryan have a garden in the backyard where he\u2019s learning to grow vegetables for the first time. He enjoys growing things, but his plants aren\u2019t producing too well.\n\nAll three of the roommates buy natural, green, and environmentally friendly products. They love learning new things to keep life interesting.\n\nRyan goes to lots of music shows, especially the big outdoor events in Austin. He likes living close to downtown, with the new library and Farmer\u2019s Market.\n\nLike most people his age, he looks for information on YouTube first. He posts on Instagram when the mood strikes but finds most social media boring.\n\nHe graduated from U.T. with a degree in computer engineering and hasn\u2019t thought too seriously about getting married or having children.\n\nStep # 4: Ryan\u2019s gardening hopes and fears.\n\nI need to find out what he hopes to gain from my book or article, what motivates him. At the same time, I\u2019ll gain insight to help me market my book.\n\nSocial media makes it easy.\n\nFacebook has groups about nearly everything. Join some groups in the same genre or subject as you write. Go to the group page, and with the \u2018search\u2019 function, look for questions people are asking.\n\nFor instance, on the Central Texas Vegetable Gardening page, I typed, \u201cHow do I ___?\u2019\n\nQuestions include, \u2018how do I prepare my soil? \u2018when do I plant?\u2019 \u2018how much should I water? and \u2018what about caterpillars?\u2019\n\nI also see people say things like, \u2018I\u2019m a newbie, so don\u2019t laugh\u2026\u2019, \u2018this is a dumb question\u2026\u2019, \u2018it\u2019s my first year\u2026\u2019. People are insecure, but they have lots of questions!\n\nQuora is another place to see what questions people are asking in a more global audience. Questions include \u2018how much room do I need to grow all my vegetables?\u2019, \u2018what are the easiest vegetables to grow?\u2019, and \u2018how do I grow bigger vegetables?\u2019\n\nIf I\u2019m stuck for questions, I can read Reddit, too. Again, just simple keywords like \u2018grow, vegetables, problems\u2019 can bring some leads.\n\nRead an article like this one: Social Media Demographics, to find out where your typical reader spends time. Since YouTube is the top social media for Ryan, I check it out and find the top views on the subject are for Gardening 101 and A Complete Guide to Digging & Planting a Vegetable Garden.\n\nAmazon book reviews can be incredible sources of insight.\n\nParticularly, I am looking for the specific problems readers are attempting to solve. I take notes of the exact words they use as these will be valuable terms to include for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes.\n\nI look for \u2018Beginning Vegetable Gardening\u2019 and read reviews of highly and poorly rated titles. It\u2019s helpful to see what people find useful and what they don\u2019t like.\n\nReviewers use words like precise, concise, easy-to-understand, good index, lots of pictures, and mention that one of the popular authors has a website and podcast, too.\n\nSeveral readers mentioned that the book didn\u2019t mention it was mainly for U.S. readers, and they were located in the U.K., making a lot of the text irrelevant.\n\nNegatives include not being detailed enough for beginners and assuming that the reader had more prior experience than they did.\n\nForget your generalized audience. In the first place, the nameless, faceless audience will scare you to death and in the second place, unlike the theater, it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn writing, your audience is one single reader. I have found that sometimes it helps to pick out one person \u2014 a real person you know, or an imagined person and write to that one. \u2014 John Steinbeck\n\nStep # 5: Ready to write\n\nHopefully, Ryan won\u2019t be the only reader of my new book. I will make two more profiles for this book and keep all these people in mind as I write. I frequently visit new gardeners as a consultant, and that first-hand contact adds depth to my research.\n\nLikely readers include Susan and Peter, a recently retired couple planning to start a garden. And Felicia has plans to move to a small farm in the country but is eager to learn garden skills.\n\nThis research tells me what Ryan, Susan, Peter, and Felicia hope to learn.\n\nIt will also give me ideas to develop my social media content calendar and to market my writing.\n\nFor instance, Ryan wants to grow some kick-ass vegetables to cook and impress his friends. He won\u2019t spend all weekend gardening-he has other things to do. He\u2019s looking for simple, straightforward information \u2014 hopefully with links to YouTube tutorials to clarify the tricky points.\n\nHe\u2019ll lose interest if I geek out on Latin names for vegetables and a deep dive into soil science. K.I.S.S. is what I need to focus on. When I start going crazy with the details, thinking about Ryan helps me concentrate.\n\nWhen I\u2019m writing, I pinned my taped my reader avatar to the wall above my desk, so I\u2019d remember to keep them in mind.\n\nRyan shops at the Farmer\u2019s Market; perhaps I could sell books there to build some buzz. Would there be a way to tie into the huge techie community in Austin with cooking demonstrations with a popular vegan chef?\n\nThe possibilities are enormous! These tips will make your writing more engaging and help you effectively market your books and articles.",

        "text": "We\u2019re all on the inside looking out. Image courtesy of Joshua Rawson-Harris via Unsplash\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of freedom in my life. I\u2019ve traveled wherever my heart has desired near or far. I\u2019ve gotten in car and just driven until everything I\u2019ve known is but a distant dot in my rear view mirror. I\u2019ve (literally and unfortunately) gotten lost in a Costa Rican rainforest. I\u2019ve slept under the stars, in a dumpster (for science!), in a yurt, and even on a boat. I\u2019m the Dr. Seuss of adventure.\n\nI\u2019m a free spirit, meant to roam this Earth.\n\nWhen the pandemic started I knew it would be tough. I knew the brakes on all travel, even to the grocery store, would be severely limited. I wanted to, and still want to, do my part by practicing social distancing.\n\nI am staying six-feet and more from everyone and most things I know and care about. Last week as I sat in my home office dressed in a bathing suit, a top knot bun, yoga pants, and body glitter, I realized \u2014 I may be experiencing a bit of the ol\u2019 cabin fever.\n\n\u201cCabin fever is a distressing claustrophobic irritability or restlessness experienced when a person is stuck at an isolated location or confined quarters for an extended period of time.\u201d \u2014 Wikipedia\n\nDistressed? Check. Irritable? Double check. Restlessness? Oh, yeah! Cabin fever is a state of mind. It\u2019s a stranger than fiction combination of anxiety, boredom, edgy, irascibility that is sometimes hard to define, but you can feel it in every fiber of your being. Some of us are very social creatures and we work, think, act, and enjoy life better when we have contact with other people. If you are prone to intense bouts of anxiety, depression, or loneliness, the current state of things can turn a comical case of cabin fever into a serious saddlebag of negative consequences.\n\nCue the stress and welcome the effects that accompany this such as:\n\nFeelings of hopelessness\n\nIncrease self doubt\n\nDecrease self worth\n\nExcess weight gain or loss\n\nInflammation (i.e. body aches and pains)\n\nWeakened immune system\n\nFatigue and sleeping difficulties\n\nInability to focus or brain fog\n\n\u2026and much more\n\nI\u2019m not even getting into the domino effect that stress from loneliness and isolation can cause putting you at greater risk for more serious medical and emotional problems. In a time where sadly almost 9% \u2014 that\u2019s 44 million \u2014 Americans have no health insurance. Plus an additional 38 million have what is described as \u2018inadequate\u2019 health insurance, you might not have the luxury of calling your therapist, scheduling extra sessions with your life coach, or reaching out to your primary physician to talk about medication options. You may feel like you appear to be doing \u2018okay\u2019 on the outside but aren\u2019t feeling so great on the inside.\n\nStir-crazy like a baker\u2019s mixer\n\nThe isolation and social distancing will hit us all differently, mind, body, and soul \u2014 but you can beat the blues before they beat you. I\u2019ve found the following assorted ways have aided me in avoiding feeling like the walls are closing in (because they aren\u2019t, I promise).\n\nYou are still adjusting to this new way of life\n\nIt\u2019s important to maintain or build a comfortable level of social connections with the world and people around you. This goes doubly if you are living with mental or physical health issues. When you lack meaningful attachments, things can start to look and feel more bleak than they actually are.\n\nWhatever you\u2019re feeling may be in passing or may be lingering for months with no improvement. However, few simple lifestyle changes can combat cabin fever head on and while none of the above will completely eradicate your feelings of fatigue, loneliness, or social claustrophobia, it can help get you started in the right direction.",

        "title": "Image Segmentation with Python",
        "text": "Thresholding\n\nIn image processing, thresholding is the process of creating a binary image from a grayscale image. A binary image is one whose pixels can have only two values \u2014 0 (black) or 255 (white).\n\nIn the simplest case of thresholding, you select a value as a threshold and any pixel above this value becomes white (255), while any below becomes black (0). Check out the OpenCV documentation for image thresholding for more types and the parameters involved.\n\nthresh = [cv2.threshold(img, np.mean(img), 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)[1] for img in tqdm(gray)]\n\nThe first parameter passed to cv2.threshold() is the grayscale image to be converted, the second is the threshold value, the third is the value which will be assigned to the pixel if it crosses the threshold, and finally we have the type of thresholding.\n\ncv2.threshold() returns two values, the first being an optimal threshold calculated automatically if you use cv2.THRESH_OTSU , and the second being the actual thresholded object. Since we\u2019re only concerned about the object, we subscript [1] to append only the second returned value in our thresh list.\n\nYou can choose a static threshold, but then it won\u2019t be able to take the different lighting conditions of different photos into account. I\u2019ve chosen np.mean() , which gives the average value of a pixel for the image. Lighter images will have a value greater than 127.5 (255/2), while darker images will have a lower value. This lets you threshold images based on their lighting conditions.\n\nFor the first image, the threshold is 126.34, which means that the image is slightly darker than average. Any pixel which has a value greater than this will be converted to white, and any less, will be made black. But wait! If you notice the grayscale image, the leaf is darker than the background. If we apply a normal threshold, the darker pixels become black, while lighter pixels become white. This will apply a black mask on the leaf, not the background. To deal with this, we use the THRESH_BINARY_INV method, which inverts the thresholding process. Now, pixels having an intensity greater than the threshold will be made black \u2014 those with less, white.\n\nLets have a look at the pixel intensities for the first thresholded image:\n\nAs you can see, the pixels which were lighter (top row) in the grayscale array are now black, while those which were darker (bottom row), are now white.\n\nLets see the thresholded images to verify:",

        "title": "Why Do I Feel Guilty When My Mental Health is Good?",
        "text": "Much of my current writing efforts center around my experience dealing with my poor mental health. Even so, my personal health is not my niche. I like to think I spend most of my time being an advocate and talking about mental health in general. But I have to admit the most impactful stories I\u2019ve written have been about times in my life where my mental illness got the best of me \u2014 whether it\u2019s suicide, self-harm, or psychotic episodes.\n\nOver my years of writing about these experiences, I\u2019ve been thorough and have hardly left a stone unturned, so when I do feel like writing about my personal life, there aren\u2019t many unique scary stories left. I try to avoid writing about the mundane details of everyday life \u2014 I blog on Facebook for that. I save my time here on Medium for the remarkable.\n\nThe thing that drives me now more than ever is my need to help others. The best way I know to help is to write about the experiences that shaped the person I am today. So, the point I\u2019m getting to is if I run out of \u201cmaterial,\u201d how am I going to continue to help people?\n\nIs it weird that I feel guilty that more bad things aren\u2019t happening to me so I can overcome them and write about it?\n\nPhoto by Milada Vigerova on Unsplash\n\nI\u2019m all about honesty\n\nI know you may be thinking I\u2019m a writer \u2014 couldn\u2019t I make up scenarios and create lessons around them, like Aesop\u2019s Fables?\n\nMy answer is no. My whole persona, my voice, my relatability \u2014 is built on the fact that I\u2019m honest about the things that happened to me in my life. I never embellish, and I never hold back important details, even if they are heartbreaking and embarrassing.\n\nI know we should be adaptable and willing to change, but I\u2019m not sure I can make an impact with stories I\u2019m not 100% invested in. I can\u2019t change who I am for views and reads. I know the purpose of the views and reads is to help people, but I\u2019m so attached to helping people with my own experiences that it would feel like cheating if I made up stories.\n\nDoes that make any sense? I feel so strongly about connecting with others through my writing, and I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything that would jeopardize not only the reader\u2019s feelings toward me but my own opinion about myself.\n\nPhoto by Warren Wong on Unsplash\n\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nI\u2019m going to keep writing about my life, and I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll always be able to put a different spin on the story, but eventually, people are going to get tired of my talking about the voices I hear, my suicide attempts, and the years of depression and anxiety.\n\nMy recovery may be progressing faster than I\u2019d imagined, so I can\u2019t count on bad things to keep happening. Besides, feeling guilty for having good mental health is about the silliest thing I\u2019ve ever heard from my mouth.\n\nI only have the stories I have, and I\u2019ll have to continue to find a way to use them to create articles and essays with the sole purpose of helping others. My job as a writer is to find unique ways to tie them together with my new stories of building a life after mental illness.\n\nPhoto by Kat Stokes on Unsplash\n\nA different path\n\nI\u2019m unique in many ways. All ego aside, I know I have an interesting story to tell. I am a man who has made it through some of the hardest years anyone could have lived. I\u2019m building a life despite being schizoaffective and hearing voices. I\u2019ve learned to exist with an illness that most of the time will send the sufferer through a life of mental hospitals and debilitating medications.\n\nI came back from almost ending my life and used my attempts as a catalyst to change everything about myself. I mutilated myself for years and now use my scars as a lesson to others that even if you hit bottom, you can still find your way out of the rabbit hole.\n\nI\u2019m on the road to better mental health, and it was a hard battle to get here. I\u2019m sure the stories I live from here on out can also be used to help others as well.\n\nI\u2019m a brand-new father at 50 years old. I\u2019m eight years into my forever-marriage, and every day sees me getting happier and more fulfilled. Despite what I\u2019ve gone through, I\u2019m a father, a husband, a son, an advocate, a writer, an entrepreneur, an influencer, and a damn-good human being.\n\nEvery day I walk a path to greater happiness, and I feel fulfilled by every little event in my life.\n\nWriting about my life now has to be of help to someone out there. Someone out there is on the same path as I, hoping to connect with someone else who feels like they do and can relate to their story.\n\nI may have the same old painful stories of the past, but my hopeful stories from my future will help just as much.",

        "title": "10 Steps to Win with Blogging in 2021",
        "text": "10 Steps to Win with Blogging in 2021\n\nA no-stress guide\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\n2021 is almost here and now is a good time to start a blog so that you can experience some success and make real money in the new year.\n\nMany people choose blogging as their professional career and make a decent income doing it. Many newcomers consider blogging to be their professional career but don\u2019t know the proper way to start making money.\n\nHowever, if you want to start a blog, you have to go through the steps and do the work. And if you\u2019re diligent your blog can perform well and earn more revenue with your blog. This article is about starting and running an effective blog business to earn a little more in 2021.\n\nHere are the steps to start a blog and make money in 2021:\n\n1. Choose a suitable niche\n\nBefore you plan to develop a blog, you should decide on the blog\u2019s niche. At this stage, some research may be needed on the market/niche because domain knowledge is necessary to write and run a niche blog.\n\nSeveral niches can be used for your blogs, but you should plan to choose just one that\u2019s dear to your heart and interests. If you choose a competitive niche, then it can be difficult for you to rank on search engines against your peers. Don\u2019t be afraid of this. Some of the more common niches are written as follows:\n\nFashion\n\nHealth & Fitness\n\nSports\n\nEducation\n\nTechnology\n\nMarketing\n\nNews\n\n2. Choose a conspicuous brand name for your blog\n\nBlogging is a real business in which you invest your money, time, and effort. In this regard, you need to consider branding your blog by giving it a professional, creative name. A good name could attract the audience to read your blog when the name is discussed. Once you have selected the niche, you should focus on choosing the best name that fits your niche and attracts the attention of the user.\n\nRemember that the name you select must be unique and interesting. Hopefully, the domain will be available for your blog that matches your desired blog name. Finally, the name should fully describe your brand and be inviting to your target demographic.\n\n3. Buy a domain and hosting\n\nThe domain is the name used by users and search engines to recognize and access your blog while hosting is the server on which all your files are stored. There are thousands of domain registrars and website hosting companies.\n\nThe task is to find the best domain registrar and hosting provider because bad hosting will cause a lot of problems for your blog. The main concerns would be the speed and security of your blog. If your website\u2019s page speed is not fast, search engines won\u2019t rank your site higher than your competitors.\n\n4. Choose a platform for your blog\n\nHere are two ways to create your blog\u2013use a content management system (CMS) and or code it from the ground up. If you know how to code, you can create your own blog, but it could be a complex and time-consuming to create an appealing blog this way.\n\nThe CMS is the most popular option and WordPress is the most commonly used CMS. WordPress is one of the best options for making your blog because it provides the themes and plugins that will help you develop and launch your site quickly. Besides, you can change the colors of your blog, header, footer, or add the post to WordPress quickly and very easily. If that\u2019s not enough, WordPress is available on the cPanel of most web hosting platforms.\n\n5. Customize your blog\n\nIn this step, you need to install a WordPress theme or develop it yourself. After that, you have to choose the colors you want for your blog and generally customize it. The best combination of colors increases the interest of readers. If you use WordPress, you can add neat widgets on your header, body, sidebar, and footers to improve user experience.\n\n6. Create a content strategy\n\nBy this point, your blog\u2019s done and the steps to operation and monetization begin! Now, you can create some of the effective strategies for the regular writing of your content. The content should be unique, informative, and inviting to the reader and if you are successful with your content strategy, your visitor will become loyal readers! In addition to writing, make strategies to organize your content with a content calendar, optimize your content, and share it via your social media channels. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nPower tip: Use a duplicate content checker before publishing content from another writer on your blog.\n\n7. Search Engine Optimization\n\nTo reach the top position on SERPs (search engine result pages), you should apply SEO optimization to your blog in the following ways:\n\nOn-Page SEO\n\nOff-Page SEO\n\nTechnical SEO\n\nBacklinking\n\nKeyword research\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nSearch Engine Marketing\n\n8. Apply for AdSense and other sources of income\n\nThere are many ways to earn money from your blog, including ads, affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, and event blogging. A couple of these options are briefly explained below:\n\nDisplay Ads\n\nThe best-known brand for displaying the ads is Google AdSense, which pays you according to clicks and impressions on your website. You should apply after you have read the Terms of Use and after your blog is six months old. You can also apply for Ezoic after your website reaches 10,000 sessions per month or Mediavine after your blog reaches 50,000 sessions per month.\n\nAffiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing is to sell someone\u2019s product, but by displaying and discussing the product on your blog. If your site visitor buys a service or product after clicking an affiliate link on your blog, you will receive a commission under the agreement. Cha-ching! You can look into making an affiliate account with companies like Amazon and eBay.\n\n9. Social Media Marketing\n\nWe all know the importance of social media in today\u2019s world, and if you (or someone on your team) are not active on social media then you are missing a big opportunity to share your content. Your readers and competitors are on social media and you should be too.\n\n10. Analytics\n\nAnalytics are kind of like having exam results year-round. Analytics helps you measure the success rate of your campaigns, whether on your blogging, link building, or social media marketing. Analytics help you to know the views, bounce rate, and session time of your website. If you\u2019re not measuring your traffic via analytics then you don\u2019t know where you stand. Don\u2019t skip this last important step for starting a blog in 2021.\n\nUse Google Analytics to track website analytics for your blog and Hotjar to track how visitors interact with your website. That\u2019s it. No unnecessary conclusion needed. Get to work now by choosing your blog\u2019s niche.",

        "title": "An Introduction to t-SNE with Python Example",
        "text": "Introduction\n\nI\u2019ve always had a passion for learning and consider myself a lifelong learner. Being at SAS, as a data scientist, allows me to learn and try out new algorithms and functionalities that we regularly release to our customers. Often times, the algorithms are not technically new, but they\u2019re new to me which makes it a lot of fun.\n\nRecently, I had the opportunity to learn more about t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). In this post I\u2019m going to give a high-level overview of the t-SNE algorithm. I\u2019ll also share some example python code where I\u2019ll use t-SNE on both the Digits and MNIST dataset.\n\nWhat is t-SNE?\n\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is an unsupervised, non-linear technique primarily used for data exploration and visualizing high-dimensional data. In simpler terms, t-SNE gives you a feel or intuition of how the data is arranged in a high-dimensional space. It was developed by Laurens van der Maatens and Geoffrey Hinton in 2008.\n\nt-SNE vs PCA\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Principal Components Analysis (PCA), then like me, you\u2019re probably wondering the difference between PCA and t-SNE. The first thing to note is that PCA was developed in 1933 while t-SNE was developed in 2008. A lot has changed in the world of data science since 1933 mainly in the realm of compute and size of data. Second, PCA is a linear dimension reduction technique that seeks to maximize variance and preserves large pairwise distances. In other words, things that are different end up far apart. This can lead to poor visualization especially when dealing with non-linear manifold structures. Think of a manifold structure as any geometric shape like: cylinder, ball, curve, etc.\n\nt-SNE differs from PCA by preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities whereas PCA is concerned with preserving large pairwise distances to maximize variance. Laurens illustrates the PCA and t-SNE approach pretty well using the Swiss Roll dataset in Figure 1 [1]. You can see that due to the non-linearity of this toy dataset (manifold) and preserving large distances that PCA would incorrectly preserve the structure of the data.\n\nFigure 1 \u2014 Swiss Roll Dataset. Preserve small distance with t-SNE (solid line) vs maximizing variance PCA [1]\n\nHow t-SNE works\n\nNow that we know why we might use t-SNE over PCA, lets discuss how t-SNE works. The t-SNE algorithm calculates a similarity measure between pairs of instances in the high dimensional space and in the low dimensional space. It then tries to optimize these two similarity measures using a cost function. Let\u2019s break that down into 3 basic steps.\n\n1. Step 1, measure similarities between points in the high dimensional space. Think of a bunch of data points scattered on a 2D space (Figure 2). For each data point (xi) we\u2019ll center a Gaussian distribution over that point. Then we measure the density of all points (xj) under that Gaussian distribution. Then renormalize for all points. This gives us a set of probabilities (Pij) for all points. Those probabilities are proportional to the similarities. All that means is, if data points x1 and x2 have equal values under this gaussian circle then their proportions and similarities are equal and hence you have local similarities in the structure of this high-dimensional space. The Gaussian distribution or circle can be manipulated using what\u2019s called perplexity, which influences the variance of the distribution (circle size) and essentially the number of nearest neighbors. Normal range for perplexity is between 5 and 50 [2].\n\nFigure 2 \u2014 Measuring pairwise similarities in the high-dimensional space\n\n2. Step 2 is similar to step 1, but instead of using a Gaussian distribution you use a Student t-distribution with one degree of freedom, which is also known as the Cauchy distribution (Figure 3). This gives us a second set of probabilities (Qij) in the low dimensional space. As you can see the Student t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution. The heavy tails allow for better modeling of far apart distances.\n\nFigure 3 \u2014 Normal vs Student t-distribution\n\n3. The last step is that we want these set of probabilities from the low-dimensional space (Qij) to reflect those of the high dimensional space (Pij) as best as possible. We want the two map structures to be similar. We measure the difference between the probability distributions of the two-dimensional spaces using Kullback-Liebler divergence (KL). I won\u2019t get too much into KL except that it is an asymmetrical approach that efficiently compares large Pij and Qij values. Finally, we use gradient descent to minimize our KL cost function.\n\nUse Case for t-SNE\n\nNow that you know how t-SNE works let\u2019s talk quickly about where it is used. Laurens van der Maaten shows a lot of examples in his video presentation [1]. He mentions the use of t-SNE in areas like climate research, computer security, bioinformatics, cancer research, etc. t-SNE could be used on high-dimensional data and then the output of those dimensions then become inputs to some other classification model.\n\nAlso, t-SNE could be used to investigate, learn, or evaluate segmentation. Often times we select the number of segments prior to modeling or iterate after results. t-SNE can often times show clear separation in the data. This can be used prior to using your segmentation model to select a cluster number or after to evaluate if your segments actually hold up. t-SNE however is not a clustering approach since it does not preserve the inputs like PCA and the values may often change between runs so it\u2019s purely for exploration.\n\nCode Example\n\nBelow is some python code (Figures below with link to GitHub) where you can see the visual comparison between PCA and t-SNE on the Digits and MNIST datasets. I select both of these datasets because of the dimensionality differences and therefore the differences in results. I also show a technique in the code where you can run PCA prior to running t-SNE. This can be done to reduce computation and you\u2019d typically reduce down to ~30 dimensions and then run t-SNE.\n\nI ran this using python and calling the SAS libraries. It may appear slightly different than what you\u2019re use to and you can see that in the images below. I used Seaborn for my visuals which I thought was great, but with t-SNE you may get really compact clusters and need to zoom in. Another visualization tool, like Plotly, may be better if you need to zoom in or manipulate your plot object.

        "text": "7TH ARMY JOINT MULTINATIONAL TRAINING \u2014 COMMAND/VICTOR TANGERMANN\n\nFUTURISTIC INVENTION\n\nResearchers created an invisibility cloak from this \u2018artificial skin\u2019\n\nMimicking the color and temperature of their environment, this novel tech can make soldiers \u2018invisible\u2019\n\nCloaking devices from the yesteryears Scifi show \u2018Star Trek\u2019 are now becoming a reality. A lot of research has been undertaken in this area recently. For now, most of these applications are being developed for specific use cases like the one we are going to discuss today \u2014 giving soldiers the ability to blend in with their natural surroundings.\n\nBack in 2019, I wrote about a Canadian biotech company, Hyperstealth Biotechnology Corp. which reached the patent application stage with its light-bending, paper-thin & inexpensive futuristic material \u2014 making things invisible behind it. Their prototype \u201cQuantum Stealth\u201d material was also developed for military purposes.\n\nWhile the Canadian company used a paper-thin material to develop the invisibility cloak, South Korean researchers have taken this to the next level by developing an \u201cartificial skin\u201d that could allow soldiers to perfectly blend in with their surroundings. The resulting cloak not only makes them invisible to regular cameras but also to infrared-based night vision as well.\n\nAlthough the novel tech sounds futuristic and out of a sci-fi movie, there are examples of this in nature \u2014 like the chameleon\u2019s ability to blend into the surroundings. This invention just takes this natural cloaking ability from the visible light spectrum to the next step by masking the heat signature of the wearer as well.\n\n\u201cThe cloaking in the visible range is therefore achieved separately by matching the ambient color\u2026 we recently developed a method to detect and mimic the environment by integrating a micro camera with our devices to make an autonomously working device.\u201d ~ Seung Hwan Ko, Team Lead\n\nAccording to the research, it uses flexible patches that can camouflage itself and is capable of cooling down or heating up depending on its surrounding environment. The process of switching only takes about five seconds. giving the soldiers the ability to camouflage themselves during the daytime and not show at thermal cameras at night.",

        "text": "You Don\u2019t Need Others to Feel Creative\n\n4 positive steps to regain your creative confidence\n\nPhoto by Bernard Hermant on Unsplash\n\nWhen constantly working in groups, it is easy to doubt your creative potential, as all your ideas are usually inspired by the ideas of others.\n\nYou may even think that you are unable to innovate on your own without group consultation.\n\nBut while the value of collective thinking is certain, human projects have always been fueled by individual brains. Your neurons make more unexpected connections than your meetings will ever do.\n\nAnd the more you lose confidence in your creative potential, the more you will lose this intellectual energy.\n\nHow to recover your creative confidence to illuminate your projects with original ideas?\n\nAccording to David and Tom Kelley in Creative Confidence, you can regain your belief in your creativity by forcing yourself into new experiences.\n\nThe most creative professionals have learned to reflect on their \u201ccreativity scars\u2019\u2019, reappropriating their self-mastery, embracing their mistakes, and creating in more visual and playful ways.\n\nUsing their examples, here are 4 steps to put a spark of creativity back in your projects and take them in hand.\n\n1. Reflecting on Your Creativity Scars\n\nWhen it comes to being creative, you may find yourself thinking that it\u2019s not for you and that others are better at it than you are\u2026\n\nBut being creative is natural, as shown by children\u2019s innate ability to try and experiment with new things, and to use effortlessly their imaginations.\n\nYour attitude of self-doubt, however, is not. It often comes from moments during your childhood when certain people have denied your creativity: the art teacher or friends who have denied the talent of your collages, drawings, photos\u2026\n\nSome people may have been a bad influence, making you lose your belief in the power of your imagination, and suggesting that creativity belongs exclusively to real artists and dreamers.\n\nTo change your views, remember the times during your education when your talents as a singer, painter, writer were denied. Analyze how they have taken you away from your passions for creative activities (drawing, acting, singing\u2026).\n\nSuccessful musicians like Paul McCartney and George Harrison of the Beatles were in music class together in high school, with a teacher who didn\u2019t even recognize their talent and gave them no encouragement. Two decades later they were part of one of the most beloved bands of the 20th century.\n\nThat gives you something to put into perspective!\n\n2. Regaining a Sense of Self-Mastery\n\nWhen you try to test again your creative abilities, you may wonder where to start. You may fear that your actions will have no impact on your environment.\n\nTo dispel that doubt, you need to regain a sense of self-efficiency in your actions, by embarking on step-by-step experimentations.\n\nFor example, the famous social psychologist Albert Bandura has used an innovative method to help his patients confront their phobia of snakes: through trials that brought them closer and closer to the sight and touch of a snake.\n\nIt started by getting closer behind a door, listening to their sound, looking at them in a mirror, and then touching them. This process allowed them to overcome their fear by acting little by little on it, gaining more control over it.\n\nA few months later, these same patients had learned to overcome their fear and problem by taking the initiative and using their creativity to gradually take control of their problem. They had also learned the belief that they could change something that seemed insurmountable at the time by taking action if only a little.\n\nIn the same way, you need to start with small actions to overcome your fear of being judged and your doubts. This will allow you to regain your self-mastery when it comes to using your creativity.\n\n3. Owning Your Failures\n\nOne of the other essential keys to unlocking your creativity is to learn to accept your mistakes and even to seek out more and more of them.\n\nThe greatest innovators like Thomas Edison or the Wright Brothers have been as creative by having the ability and the environment to engage in broad and constant experimentation.\n\nYou may need to assimilate this optimism taught by video games, that behind your failures progress and success are never too far away.\n\nIt is a question of creating such a \u201cvirtual\u201d environment around you, which makes you want to test your creative abilities where no one judges you and you don\u2019t fear losing something.\n\nFor example, a juggling teacher has taught his students to accept their mistakes by starting his classes with \u201cball drop sessions\u201d: the goal is to throw their balls and let them fall each time. This exercise reduces the pressure on new students and makes them take risks, as they usually tend to avoid dropping their balls at all costs.\n\nIn the same way, rediscovering activities with fewer stakes, such as writing in a diary, drawing at home, finding artistic hobbies you have given up for a while (theatre, acting,) are all solutions to regain confidence in your creativity. It enables you to experiment with your creative talents without doubting yourself too much.\n\nThey let you make your mistakes and teach you their creative value.\n\n4. Creating in a More Visual and Playful Way\n\nWhen you try to put a creative impulse into your projects, you may wonder what you may change first, and even if a change is really necessary.\n\nYou may be paralyzed by your perfectionism, as you don\u2019t want to present ideas outside of your area of expertise or change your plans too abruptly.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to put too much pressure on you.\n\nTo add a creative touch, sometimes simple and playful means are enough: drawings, maps, and diagrams help you redesign your decisions and the situation of your projects.\n\nDan Roam, an expert in the art of visual thinking, insists that anyone can draw anything \u2014 even if they don\u2019t feel naturally creative or gifted \u2014 just by deconstructing it into 5 basic shapes: a circle, a line, a square, a triangle, and an irregular shape.\n\nStarting from these shapes, you can describe new emotions, relationships, and ideas on a board, and reconsider the scheme of your projects in new ways. You can retrace the arguments for your decisions, renew the presentation of your figures, reconsider the emotions of your clients with the help of a simple pencil.\n\nAll this without having to bother being a professional painter or drawer: only by making visual and natural creativity work!",

        "title": "How Covid-19 May Affect the Brain\u2019s Dopamine and Serotonin Levels",
        "text": "How Covid-19 May Affect the Brain\u2019s Dopamine and Serotonin Levels\n\nThis could be why 18% of Covid-19 survivors had psychiatric diagnoses, a population-sized study finds.\n\nAdapted from Medical vector created by freepik \u2014 www.freepik.com\n\nIn April, a research review with an interesting title was published: \u201cAre we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms.\u201d This review draws on past pandemics and epidemics to infer what might happen following the Covid-19 pandemic, which a wave of psychiatric maladies.\n\nFast-forward today, we may finally see that wave. A paper published this month in The Lancet Psychiatry found that 18% of Covid-19 survivors \u2014 regardless of hospitalization status \u2014 develop psychiatric disorders within 14 to 90 days of infection. Considering the pandemic scale that has exceeded 57 million cases and 1.3 million deaths, 18% is huge.\n\nWhat the study did and found\n\nUsing the TriNetX Analytics Network that stores health data of nearly 70 million patients across 54 healthcare organizations in the U.S., researchers at the University of Oxford identified 62,354 cases of Covid-19 as of August.\n\nThe study controlled for 50 covariates that may influence the results, which include age, sex, race, socioeconomic factors, nicotine dependence, and comorbidities (kidney, liver, heart and lung diseases, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and psoriasis).\n\n\u201cPeople have been worried that Covid-19 survivors will be at greater risk of mental health problems, and our findings \u2026 show this to be likely.\u201d\n\nAfter adjusting for covariates, they found 18% of Covid-19 survivors received a psychiatry diagnosis within 14 to 90 days of infection, of whom 5.8% had no history of psychiatric disorder. These 18% and 5.8% rates translate to a 1.5- to 2-times increased rate of recurrent and first-time diagnoses, respectively, compared to groups with a non-Covid health event \u2014 such as influenza, other respiratory infections, skin infections, gallstones, kidney stones, and bone fracture. Anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and insomnia were the most common diagnoses.\n\nEven in Covid-19 cases that do not require hospital care, the risk of psychiatric aftermath remains 1.5\u20132-times higher. \u201cThe elevated risk of psychiatric sequelae after Covid-19 diagnosis compared with control health events could not be readily explained by differences in illness severity,\u201d the authors wrote, although a modest dose-dependent relationship seems to exist. However, I would keep an open mind until further studies replicate the findings that even mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 would affect a person\u2019s mental health.\n\n\u201cPeople have been worried that Covid-19 survivors will be at greater risk of mental health problems, and our findings \u2026 show this to be likely,\u201d Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford who directed the study, stated.\n\nThe study also found that a history of psychiatric disorder led to a 1.6-times increased risk of positive Covid-19 diagnosis. Indeed, pre-existing psychiatric disorders do count as comorbidities that up the risk of more severe Covid-19. \u201cHaving a psychiatric disorder should be added to the list of risk factors for Covid-19,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Max Taquet, Ph.D., a psychiatry researcher.\n\nThus, in this study, the diagnosed depression and anxiety cases may not be as severe as to qualify as major depression or anxiety disorders.\n\nAs with any studies, results must be interpreted in light of the study caveats. For one, despite already accounting for 50 covariates, the authors admitted that overlooked covariate may still be present. The geographical limitation to the U.S. only is also another drawback. Specifics about the psychiatric diagnoses were also lacking, such as severity or diagnostic criteria, which is a serious limitation that may undermine the study.\n\nJames C. Coyne, a health psychology professor at the University Medical Center Groningen, critiqued that the pandemic\u2019s front liners may not have made diagnoses as accurately as a psychiatrist. A structured psychiatric interview, he said, usually takes 30 to 90 minutes, which is overly time-consuming at a massive scale. Thus, in this study, the diagnosed depression and anxiety cases may not be as severe as to qualify as major depression or anxiety disorders.\n\nBiomolecular underpinnings\n\nLet\u2019s assume Covid-19 survivors indeed have a 1.5\u20132-times increased rate of future psychiatric diagnoses than survivors of other health events (e.g., influenza, gallstones, skin infection, etc.). Why is Covid-19 more strongly linked to psychiatry than other health events?\n\nPart I: ACE2/DDC pathway\n\nACE2 is the receptor SARS-CoV-2 (that causes Covid-19) uses to enter cells. ACE2 co-expresses and co-regulates with dopa decarboxylase (DDC), an enzyme that makes serotonin and dopamine \u2014 neurochemicals involved in depression and anxiety. Upon cell infection, SARS-CoV-2 engulfs the ACE2 receptor, which lowers ACE2 expression on the cell. This decreases DDC expression as well, halting the production of dopamine and serotonin.\n\n\u201cHence, a SARS-CoV-2- induced defective expression of ACE2 might be paralleled by a DDC dysfunction, with consequent potentially altered neurotransmitters\u2019 levels in Covid\u201019 patients,\u201d stated a paper published last month in the European Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nRecall that SARS-CoV-2 lowers ACE2 expression. The normal function of ACE2 is to convert angiotensin II to angiotensin 1\u20137. Therefore, if ACE2 decreases, angiotensin II would increase. And the problem is that angiotensin II promotes depression and anxiety as angiotensin II initiates a cascade of reactions leading to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.\n\nThe propensity to target the ACE2 receptor \u2014 in addition to cytokine storm induction \u2014 may be why SARS-CoV-2 is a greater risk factor for psychiatric aftermath than other health events such as influenza or skin infection.\n\nPart II: TRP/KYN pathway\n\nThe tryptophan/kynurenine (TRP/KYN) pathway is one of the best-studied pathways in depression and anxiety. As tryptophan crosses the blood-brain-barrier to turn into serotonin, the TRP/KYN pathway strongly influences the brain\u2019s serotonin levels.\n\nThis pathway starts when pro-inflammatory cytokines activate an enzyme called indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1). IDO-1 degrades TRP into KYN to suppress inflammation. As TRP is lost, serotonin production is compromised. And since IDO-1 is present in many organs, including the brain, systemic inflammation would lead to a system-wide decrease in serotonin levels.\n\n\u201cAll of these pathways raise the possibility of patients affected by severe Covid-19 with prolonged exposure to inflammation, may have long-term neurological sequels,\u201d wrote a research review published this month in The Neuroscientist that highlights the TRP/KYN pathway in Covid-depression.\n\nShort abstract\n\nCovid-19 survivors are at 2- and 1.5-times increased rate of recurrent and first-time psychiatric diagnoses, respectively, compared to survivors of non-Covid health events (e.g., influenza, skin infections, gallstones, etc.). Indeed, 18% of Covid-19 survivors had psychiatric aftermath \u2014 most commonly anxiety, depression, and insomnia \u2014 of which 5.8% were first-time diagnoses. The propensity to target the ACE2 receptor \u2014 in addition to cytokine storm induction\u2014 may be why SARS-CoV-2 is a greater risk factor for psychiatric aftermath than other health events.\n\nYet there\u2019s the critique that diagnoses made by the Lancet study may not be as accurate as a psychiatrist's. The study may have diagnosed depression and anxiety that may not qualify as severe major depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, there may not be a wave of serious psychiatric disorders, but a mental health one. Indeed, coupled with income loss, bereavement, and social isolation, mental health crisis may be at an all-time high.",

        "title": "Coronavirus May Be a Vascular Disease, Which Explains Everything",
        "text": "Covid-19 May Be a Blood Vessel Disease, Which Explains Everything\n\nMany of the infection\u2019s bizarre symptoms have one thing in common\n\nImage: MR.Cole_Photographer/Getty Images\n\nIn April, blood clots emerged as one of the many mysterious symptoms attributed to Covid-19, a disease that had initially been thought to largely affect the lungs in the form of pneumonia. Quickly after came reports of young people dying due to coronavirus-related strokes. Next it was Covid toes \u2014 painful red or purple digits.\n\nWhat do all of these symptoms have in common? An impairment in blood circulation. Add in the fact that 40% of deaths from Covid-19 are related to cardiovascular complications, and the disease starts to look like a vascular infection instead of a purely respiratory one.\n\nMonths into the pandemic, there is now a growing body of evidence to support the theory that the novel coronavirus can infect blood vessels, which could explain not only the high prevalence of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks, but also provide an answer for the diverse set of head-to-toe symptoms that have emerged.\n\n\u201cAll these Covid-associated complications were a mystery. We see blood clotting, we see kidney damage, we see inflammation of the heart, we see stroke, we see encephalitis [swelling of the brain],\u201d says William Li, MD, president of the Angiogenesis Foundation. \u201cA whole myriad of seemingly unconnected phenomena that you do not normally see with SARS or H1N1 or, frankly, most infectious diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you start to put all of the data together that\u2019s emerging, it turns out that this virus is probably a vasculotropic virus, meaning that it affects the [blood vessels],\u201d says Mandeep Mehra, MD, medical director of the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center.\n\nIn a paper published in April in the scientific journal The Lancet, Mehra and a team of scientists discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect the endothelial cells that line the inside of blood vessels. Endothelial cells protect the cardiovascular system, and they release proteins that influence everything from blood clotting to the immune response. In the paper, the scientists showed damage to endothelial cells in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and intestines in people with Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThe concept that\u2019s emerging is that this is not a respiratory illness alone, this is a respiratory illness to start with, but it is actually a vascular illness that kills people through its involvement of the vasculature,\u201d says Mehra.\n\nA respiratory virus infecting blood cells and circulating through the body is virtually unheard of.\n\nA one-of-a-kind respiratory virus\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is thought to enter the body through ACE2 receptors present on the surface of cells that line the respiratory tract in the nose and throat. Once in the lungs, the virus appears to move from the alveoli, the air sacs in the lung, into the blood vessels, which are also rich in ACE2 receptors.\n\n\u201c[The virus] enters the lung, it destroys the lung tissue, and people start coughing. The destruction of the lung tissue breaks open some blood vessels,\u201d Mehra explains. \u201cThen it starts to infect endothelial cell after endothelial cell, creates a local immune response, and inflames the endothelium.\u201d\n\nA respiratory virus infecting blood vessel cells and circulating through the body is virtually unheard of. Influenza viruses like H1N1 are not known to do this, and the original SARS virus, a sister coronavirus to the current infection, did not spread past the lung. Other types of viruses, such as Ebola or Dengue, can damage endothelial cells, but they are very different from viruses that typically infect the lungs.\n\nBenhur Lee, MD, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says the difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 likely stems from an extra protein each of the viruses requires to activate and spread. Although both viruses dock onto cells through ACE2 receptors, another protein is needed to crack open the virus so its genetic material can get into the infected cell. The additional protein the original SARS virus requires is only present in lung tissue, but the protein for SARS-CoV-2 to activate is present in all cells, especially endothelial cells.\n\n\u201cIn SARS1, the protein that\u2019s required to cleave it is likely present only in the lung environment, so that\u2019s where it can replicate. To my knowledge, it doesn\u2019t really go systemic,\u201d Lee says. \u201c[SARS-CoV-2] is cleaved by a protein called furin, and that\u2019s a big danger because furin is present in all our cells, it\u2019s ubiquitous.\u201d\n\nEndothelial damage could explain the virus\u2019 weird symptoms\n\nAn infection of the blood vessels would explain many of the weird tendencies of the novel coronavirus, like the high rates of blood clots. Endothelial cells help regulate clot formation by sending out proteins that turn the coagulation system on or off. The cells also help ensure that blood flows smoothly and doesn\u2019t get caught on any rough edges on the blood vessel walls.\n\n\u201cThe endothelial cell layer is in part responsible for [clot] regulation, it inhibits clot formation through a variety of ways,\u201d says Sanjum Sethi, MD, MPH, an interventional cardiologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. \u201cIf that\u2019s disrupted, you could see why that may potentially promote clot formation.\u201d\n\nEndothelial damage might account for the high rates of cardiovascular damage and seemingly spontaneous heart attacks in people with Covid-19, too. Damage to endothelial cells causes inflammation in the blood vessels, and that can cause any plaque that\u2019s accumulated to rupture, causing a heart attack. This means anyone who has plaque in their blood vessels that might normally have remained stable or been controlled with medication is suddenly at a much higher risk for a heart attack.\n\n\u201cInflammation and endothelial dysfunction promote plaque rupture,\u201d Sethi says. \u201cEndothelial dysfunction is linked towards worse heart outcomes, in particular myocardial infarction or heart attack.\u201d\n\nBlood vessel damage could also explain why people with pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease are at a higher risk for severe complications from a virus that\u2019s supposed to just infect the lungs. All of those diseases cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and the additional damage and inflammation in the blood vessels caused by the infection could push them over the edge and cause serious problems.\n\nThe theory could even solve the mystery of why ventilation often isn\u2019t enough to help many Covid-19 patients breathe better. Moving air into the lungs, which ventilators help with, is only one part of the equation. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood is just as important to provide the rest of the body with oxygen, and that process relies on functioning blood vessels in the lungs.\n\n\u201cIf you have blood clots within the blood vessels that are required for complete oxygen exchange, even if you\u2019re moving air in and out of the airways, [if] the circulation is blocked, the full benefits of mechanical ventilatory support are somewhat thwarted,\u201d says Li.\n\nA new paper published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, on which Li is a co-author, found widespread evidence of blood clots and infection in the endothelial cells in the lungs of people who died from Covid-19. This was in stark contrast to people who died from H1N1, who had nine times fewer blood clots in the lungs. Even the structure of the blood vessels was different in the Covid-19 lungs, with many more new branches that likely formed after the original blood vessels were damaged.\n\n\u201cWe saw blood clots everywhere,\u201d Li says. \u201cWe were observing virus particles filling up the endothelial cell like filling up a gumball machine. The endothelial cell swells and the cell membrane starts to break down, and now you have a layer of injured endothelium.\u201d\n\nFinally, infection of the blood vessels may be how the virus travels through the body and infects other organs \u2014 something that\u2019s atypical of respiratory infections.\n\n\u201cEndothelial cells connect the entire circulation [system], 60,000 miles worth of blood vessels throughout our body,\u201d says Li. \u201cIs this one way that Covid-19 can impact the brain, the heart, the Covid toe? Does SARS-CoV-2 traffic itself through the endothelial cells or get into the bloodstream this way? We don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d\n\nIn another paper that looked at nearly 9,000 people with Covid-19, Mehra showed that the use of statins and ACE inhibitors were linked to higher rates of survival.\n\nIf Covid-19 is a vascular disease, the best antiviral therapy might not be antiviral therapy\n\nAn alternative theory is that the blood clotting and symptoms in other organs are caused by inflammation in the body due to an over-reactive immune response \u2014 the so-called cytokine storm. This inflammatory reaction can occur in other respiratory illnesses and severe cases of pneumonia, which is why the initial reports of blood clots, heart complications, and neurological symptoms didn\u2019t sound the alarm bells. However, the magnitude of the problems seen with Covid-19 appear to go beyond the inflammation experienced in other respiratory infections.\n\n\u201cThere is some increased propensity, we think, of clotting happening with these [other] viruses. I think inflammation in general promotes that,\u201d Sethi says. \u201cIs this over and above or unique for SARS-CoV-2, or is that just because [the infection] is just that much more severe? I think those are all really good questions that unfortunately we don\u2019t have the answer to yet.\u201d\n\nAnecdotally, Sethi says the number of requests he received as the director of the pulmonary embolism response team, which deals with blood clots in the lungs, in April 2020 was two to three times the number in April 2019. The question he\u2019s now trying to answer is whether that\u2019s because there were simply more patients at the hospital during that month, the peak of the pandemic, or if Covid-19 patients really do have a higher risk for blood clots.\n\n\u201cI suspect from what we see and what our preliminary data show is that this virus has an additional risk factor for blood clots, but I can\u2019t prove that yet,\u201d Sethi says.\n\nThe good news is that if Covid-19 is a vascular disease, there are existing drugs that can help protect against endothelial cell damage. In another New England Journal of Medicine paper that looked at nearly 9,000 people with Covid-19, Mehra showed that the use of statins and ACE inhibitors were linked to higher rates of survival. Statins reduce the risk of heart attacks not only by lowering cholesterol or preventing plaque, they also stabilize existing plaque, meaning they\u2019re less likely to rupture if someone is on the drugs.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that both statins and ACE inhibitors are extremely protective on vascular dysfunction,\u201d Mehra says. \u201cMost of their benefit in the continuum of cardiovascular illness \u2014 be it high blood pressure, be it stroke, be it heart attack, be it arrhythmia, be it heart failure \u2014 in any situation the mechanism by which they protect the cardiovascular system starts with their ability to stabilize the endothelial cells.\u201d\n\nMehra continues, \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that maybe the best antiviral therapy is not actually an antiviral therapy. The best therapy might actually be a drug that stabilizes the vascular endothelial. We\u2019re building a drastically different concept.\u201d\n\nUpdate: The New England Journal of Medicine paper investigating the effect of statins and ACE inhibitors on Covid-19 mortality rates has been retracted because of concerns over the quality of the data.",

        "text": "We need a reset on how we think about the future \u2014 even with Biden and Harris in the White House\n\nDespite their monumental victory, president-elect Joe Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris have their work cut out to ensure the future is as vibrant, just and sustainable as possible\n\nPhoto by Tabrez Syed on Unsplash\n\nAs news agencies across the US declared former vice president Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 presidential election on Saturday, a tsunami of hope swept across the country. Yet as the incoming administration sets about trying to build a better future, it faces a monumental task.\n\nThe past four years have brought us closer than ever to the edge of a future that is in danger of crumbling beneath our feet; not just through the lying, the conspiracy theories and the blatant disregard for evidence, reason and basic human rights, but through a confluence of factors that are threatening to undermine our very ability to create the type of future we aspire to.\n\nWith coronavirus continuing to kill thousands of people each day and infect hundreds of thousands more, we\u2019re being starkly reminded of how hard it is to simply \u201cscience\u201d our way out of complex challenges. Yet the cracks at our metaphorical feet as we stand on the edge of tomorrow are as much a product of our social, political and technological behaviors as they are our science.\n\nMore than ever it seems, we\u2019re indulging our baser instincts to ignore the evidence in front of us and marginalize and persecute those who don\u2019t look and think like us on a grand scale. Whether this is manifest in extremism, nationalism, or a self-righteous dismissal of \u201cwrong-thinkers\u201d \u2014 meaning, simply, people who don\u2019t share our worldview \u2014 it is becoming harder to work together toward building a better future.\n\nAnd to top it all, we\u2019re becoming so wrapped up in our capacity to innovate that we\u2019re losing any semblance of ability to make smart choices between what we can do, and what we should \u2014 either as individuals, as communities and organizations, or as a society.\n\nThese are all symptomatic of deeper tensions between our collective ability to influence and change the future, and our capacity to do this effectively. And they are tensions that we will only be able to address through re-evaluating our relationship with the future, and our responsibility to it.\n\nRe-evaluating our Relationship with the Future\n\nMy work cuts across multiple areas of expertise and practice to better understand the complex relationship between past and future. And as it does, I\u2019m constantly reminded of how hard it is to ensure that social, technological and political advances don\u2019t end up causing more harm than good.\n\nClimate change, as its driven along by our technological recklessness, is a stark reminder of this. But so are the injustices that millions of people face every day that result from ill-considered political decisions, or poorly thought-through good intentions, or even technologies that threaten what is of value to them in the name of progress.\n\nUnfortunately, while we can recode DNA, design new materials atom by atom, and create machines that may one day surpass human intelligence, we are still remarkably adept as a species at preventing all too many people from reaching the futures they aspire to.\n\nBecause of this, if we are to learn to use our immense capabilities more responsibly \u2014 and avoid potentially catastrophic failures arising from our short-sightedness \u2014 we need to better-understand our relationship with the future, and our individual and collective roles in ensuring that what comes next is better than the past.\n\nAs with human relationships, this will not be easy. Yet if we better-understand how the intertwined threads that define who we are come together to make us supremely talented architects of the future, we can learn how to become better architects of that future.\n\nEscaping the Shackles of Conventional Thinking\n\nThese threads reflect our imagination, our understanding, and our inventiveness. But they also encapsulate our very humanity \u2014 our beliefs, our desires, our joys and our fears, our eccentricities and irrationalities, and our ability to see and feel the world through the eyes of others.\n\nThe very complexity of how these threads surround, intersect with and influence one another creates vulnerabilities that are near-impossible to see through the lens of conventional thinking.\n\nTo navigate this landscape, we need to be bold enough to depart from conventional ways of understanding the world. This will include learning how to be informed by disciplines without being bound by them, and becoming skilled at blending and leverage expertise in novel ways. It will also mean embracing creativity, playfulness and serendipity, as we open ourselves to new ideas and opportunities.\n\nAt the same time, we need to infuse our thinking and actions with a level of humility and care for others that, too often, seems to elude us.\n\nOnly by doing this will we be able to avoid the pitfalls of the past and see ways forward to building a vibrant and just future that is resilient, agile, and full of promise.\n\nA Pathway Forward\n\nAs the Biden/Harris team prepares to enter the White House, this is perhaps one of the largest challenges they will face.\n\nOf course, cleaning up the chaos of the past four years, finding a pathway to a post-coronavirus future, and placing the US on an economically and environmentally sustainable footing, are all critically important short-term goals. Yet even these will not be possible without pressing the reset button on how we think about the future, and our relationship with it.\n\nWith new leadership, new ideas, and a new respect for the people and society they serve, I sincerely hope that the Biden/Harris administration will rise to the challenge of pressing this reset button and rethinking our relationship with the future.\n\nIf they do, there\u2019s every chance that we\u2019ll have new opportunities to work together toward a future that is more just, more vibrant, and more sustainable \u2014 for everyone, not just a privileged few.",

Among them will be terms like \u201cside hustle\u201d and \u201cto help others.\u201d But there\u2019s really only one reason to put pen to paper \u2014 ehh, fingertips to letter keys \u2014 because you must.\n\nI started Write, I Must to arm passionate storytellers with insights and tools they need and as a place for writers with others who feel the same need to get words out of their heads. There are thousands of books on the art of writing. Still, growth happens when we get rejected, figure out what went wrong, rework if necessary, and resubmit.\n\nConfession: I get just as much out of publication as the readers. Tom Beck\u2019s 7 Benefits of Writing by Hand reminds me of my college days when penning on paper was essential during the creative and editing process. Paper and ink were expensive, and retyping stories over and over exhausting.\n\nAs a former journalist, reading Cody Wiesner\u2019s argument against the inverted pyramid was eye-opening. Side-note: journalistic writing styles aren\u2019t just for reporters.\n\nThen there\u2019s Toni Koraza \u2014 who goes against the grain in explaining why writers don\u2019t need their own website. I have one, but it\u2019s for my professional services. I never write stories there.\n\nThere is a wealth of information to be learned not just from the \u201cmasters\u201d who\u2019ve been published by some of the largest outlets but also from those who are still finding their way to the top. We read not only to understand what editors want and how we should embrace rejection but also to learn from others\u2019 mistakes.\n\nThe most genuine writers aren\u2019t solely looking for a paycheck. They write because they have no other option, even if it means only one person reads their work to the end. They\u2019re motivated by claps and comments, yet don\u2019t let these numbers define them. They write because they love the game.\n\nWhy do you write?\n\nIf you write to keep a roof over your family\u2019s head or to make extra money, that\u2019s perfectly fine. But there\u2019s really only one core reason passionate writers tell stories \u2014 because they absolutely must.",

Because this does not comply with something deep within you, your interest will lag and eventually the money will not come so easily. You will search for other easy sources of money, moving further and further away from your path. Not seeing clearly ahead of you, you will end up in a dead-end career. Even if your material needs are met, you will feel an emptiness inside that you will need to fill with any kind of belief system, drugs, or diversions. There is no compromise here, no way of escaping the dynamic. You will recognize how far you have deviated by the depth of your pain and frustration.

        "text": "At first glance they have nothing in common: a streetwear brand worn by hypebeasts around the world and a regional supermarket that started in Upstate New York.\n\nBut Supreme and Wegmans both inspire fanatical loyalty. And the way they do this is not complicated \u2014 they share value.\n\nSupreme shares value with their customers, while Wegmans shares value with its employees. And by doing this, both have created businesses that are hugely successful and have kept up impressive growth without watering down their brands.\n\nBut why is it that others are not able to take inspiration from these examples?\n\nOne word: greed.\n\nCompanies agonize over optimizing pricing to get the absolute maximum that customers are willing to pay for a product at a given time. Think about airlines that are constantly changing prices to get the maximum from each individual passenger depending on how desperate they are to get somewhere.\n\nWhile at the same time, when it comes to employees, most companies are trying to optimize for something different. They want to pay as little as possible while still being competitive enough in the marketplace that they won\u2019t lose all of their employees.\n\nBut here\u2019s the difference:\n\nSupreme could raise their prices, but they don\u2019t\n\nWegmans doesn\u2019t have to offer such a good salary and benefits package to be \u201con market\u201d for a supermarket, but they do it anyway\n\nIf you are building a business you would be wise to keep their examples in mind and resist greed for your own good.\n\nSupreme \u201cdrops\u201d leave value for their customers (and the resellers)\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the brand Supreme, it is an apparel company that sells in small batches of very limited editions called \u201cdrops\u201d that create massive lines at their stores. These drops operate on a first-come, first-served basis and all of the most in-demand products are quick to sell out.\n\nThis has created a whole second-hand ecosystem of re-sellers who make a business out of waiting in these lines and getting the best stuff. They can then immediately re-sell the items at markups sometimes greater than 1000%.\n\nYes, that is not a typo \u2014 some items really do resell for 1000%.\n\nFor somebody who\u2019s not reselling and just goes to the drops to shop for themselves, they feel like they got a great deal and it\u2019s true: Supreme sold them something that is now worth multiples of what they just paid! And since they are so excited about this great deal, they will share their experience on social media and generate even more hype for the next drop.\n\nNow here\u2019s where the greed kicks in for any normal company. Most executives would look at that secondary market and say:\n\nThat 1000% markup is money that we are leaving on the table. We should raise our prices and capture that revenue for ourselves!\n\nBut you know what happens when you take that value from the resellers and put it in your own pocket?\n\nYour products no longer sell-out immediately\n\nYou lose the long lines at your stores for the drops that create exclusivity\n\nAnd you become just any other brand\n\nSupreme shares a lot of value with customers, so they feel like they\u2019re always getting a good deal. And this in turn creates more demand and a bigger reseller market with higher second-hand prices.\n\nAs long as this cycle is feeding itself Supreme knows they will always have a line outside their stores.\n\nOf course there are now other brands like H&M trying to copy the drop strategy, but most won\u2019t be successful because they just won\u2019t be willing to give away so much value.\n\nOr in the words of one Supreme reseller:\n\n\u201cIf you are flash-dropping crap, it\u2019s still crap.\u201d\n\nThe key is not really the drop, it\u2019s about sharing value.\n\nWegmans (actually) values its employees\n\nWegmans doesn\u2019t have the global reach that Supreme does, but their customers are just as fanatically loyal.\n\nIn fact, Business Insider just reported how Wegmans is America\u2019s favorite grocery store and that thousands of people call them every year begging them to open a store in their area.\n\nAnd when asked about the secret to their success, Wegmans has a simple response that they gave in this Forbes article:\n\nIt is our employees, and the incredible service they provide our customers, that set us apart. We hire the best, and we invest in training and development,\n\nThere are no shortage of companies out there who talk about putting employees first because their employees then take good care of customers. But usually this is nothing more than talk while their behavior demonstrates something very different.\n\nBut for Wegmans, investing in their people is actually a cornerstone of their strategy and pays off in loyalty from employees and in turn, loyalty from customers.\n\nIn the same Forbes article, you can see just some of the tangible ways that they invest in people including structured development programs and scholarships that help people go from a part-time cashier in high school to a senior manager with college paid for along the way by Wegmans.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s easy to see how other retailers will envy the success of Wegmans. But most will never be able to replicate it, because they just aren\u2019t willing to share as much value with their employees.\n\nIt\u2019s not a zero-sum game\n\nIf there is one thing to learn from Supreme and from Wegmans it\u2019s that running a business is not a zero-sum game.\n\nIf your prices are low, you are giving value to your customers that will pay you back in other ways.\n\nAnd if you are paying your employees above market rates they will pay you back with loyalty and great service.\n\nOften when I\u2019m looking at pricing with the startups that I mentor, we will do lots of analysis and try to optimize the best that we can.\n\nThis is still a worthwhile exercise, but always keep this in mind: Leaving some value on the table can be a good thing.\n\nThis story is published in The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +442,678 people.\n\nSubscribe to receive our top stories here.",

        "text": "The Data\n\nNow that I\u2019ve shared some of my pain with you, I should also share some of my results.\n\nAs previously mentioned, from January 2018 to February 2019 there were 19,459,370 trips registered. After some cleaning, slicing, and wrangling, my final working data set was reduced to 17,437,855 trips. These are trips by subscribers only, as I decided to drop casual riders and one-day customers.\n\nTotal annual membership of Citi Bike now stands at 150,929 subscribers \u2014 as per to Citi Bike\u2019s monthly report. Let\u2019s take a look at who they are.\n\nWho is riding Citi Bike?\n\nThere isn\u2019t much information available on each individual subscriber, but from the data, we were able to get age and gender based on aggregate ridership. These aggregations didn\u2019t give the exact number of subscribers rather, the underlying distribution of the sample.\n\nThis was a great learning opportunity to make some interactive plots using Plotly. I found that it can be a little cumbersome at first, understanding the figure hierarchy. Plotly\u2019s graphs are stunning because even though it was built using Python and the Django framework, on the front end it uses JavaScript and the Dr.js library \u2014 so after all, I did get to use D3.js a little.\n\nThe top birth year categories for subscribers are from 1987 to 1991. Let me make the disclaimer again, Citi Bike has 150, 929 subscribers today, in order to get the distribution of those subscribers I used aggregate functions on the ridership data, as you\u2019ll see in the code snippets below.\n\nPandas DataFrame Capturing Birth Year SQL Query\n\nSubscribers by Year of Birth\n\nCode for Interactive Plotly Bar Chart\n\nGenderwise, the majority of the riders were male.\n\nPandas DataFrame from SQL query to identify Gender distribution\n\nAn interactive bar chart showing subscribers by gender. Male (1), Female (2)\n\nHow long are they riding?\n\nThe average trip duration is 13 minutes, meaning that Subscribers are not riding long distances \u2014 remember, I dropped casual riders and one-time customers.\n\nWe can also take a look at the average trip number of trips per day of the week, and as expected, the numbers were slightly higher during weekdays than during the weekend. Showing the difference between weekend rides and weekday commutes.\n\nAn interactive plot where circle size represents the average trip duration.\n\nFinally, I was interested in the relationship between the length of the ride and the day of the year.\n\nAn interactive plot showing the number of trips per day of the year.\n\nThis plot gives a complete self-explanatory picture of the fluctuation in the demand for Citi Bikes throughout the year, the demand being higher in the April-October interval when the weather is warmer. This got me curious about the relationship between the weather and the number of trips in a day, so I created a new Pandas DataFrame with the weather summary for each of the days in my original DataFrame using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nI then ran a Multiple Regression algorithm using the Scikit Learn library.\n\nMultiple Regression using Scikit Learn\n\nAs it turns out, 62% of the variance in the number of trips per day can be explained by the weather.\n\nWhere are they going?\n\nSome Citi Bike docking stations were certainly more popular than others. To map the most popular ones, both by start and end of the bike ride, I used the Folium library.\n\nBut before I could actually make an interactive map, I ran a SQL to get the top Citi Bike dock stations by rides volume. I tried mapping all of them the first time but, eventually, the program crashed. So I decided to settle for 100.\n\nA video that captures the functionality of a Folium interactive map\n\nCode to create an interactive map using the Folium library\n\nThe top 5 stations by volume of riders are:\n\nPershing Square North with 1,576,381 trips\n\nW 21 St & 6 Ave with 1,148,192 trips\n\nE 17 St & Broadway with 1,121,953 trips\n\nBroadway & E 22 St with 109,7314 trips\n\nBroadway & E 14 St 96,901 trips\n\nTo put them in context, these are dock stations near Grand Central Station, Madison Square Park, Union Square Park, and Flatiron Building.\n\nWhat about Bike 30657?\n\nFinally, I would like to honor the bike with the most trips this last year, Bike 30657 \u2014 you\u2019re now wondering if you\u2019ve ever ridden it, aren\u2019t you?.\n\nWith 2776 rides, and a total of 36,448 minutes of traveling this bike probably knows New York City better than I do. And so, as a parting gift, I\u2019ll leave you with Bike 30657 so you can see it in action.",

After all, it\u2019s common practice in the ad world, and what\u2019s more meaningful to an agency than the people who founded it?\n\nThat\u2019s where we wanted to be different.\n\nHow can our name provide deeper insight into who we really are, and what value we believe we can share? We found the answer in our brand archetype.\n\nWe\u2019re explorers.\n\nPsychologist Carl Jung created archetypes as a construct to identify the primal and instinctive stories we all share through a collective unconscious and connect us as humans.\n\nOf the 12 classic archetypes, it was easy for us to lay claim to The Explorer. We started this consultancy to stray from the herd. We wanted to find adventure, and to take risks. Discovery is paramount. Freedom is our promise. This couldn\u2019t parallel our journey more accurately.\n\nLevi\u2019s gets us.\n\nIn an industry where \u201cthere are no new ideas,\u201d copycat creative platforms often seek to build on already-existing successes rather than truly doing something different. It\u2019s like pitching a movie; How often have you heard big ideas pitched that sounded like \u201cIt\u2019s like Geico-meets-Snickers-but-on-Snapchat?\u201d\n\nI suppose there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, if it works. But for us, our vision is to create value in doing the opposite. Testing and learning what\u2019s successful by finding new insights.\n\nBut that\u2019s scary.\n\nFollowing trails blazed by successful ideas and insight isn\u2019t a bad strategy. And we won\u2019t completely abandon it. What we don\u2019t want to do is become a slave to it. We can\u2019t innovate by conforming. But when brands and clients have millions of dollars on the line, how can we convince them to take risks?\n\nBy having courage.\n\nIs this how a big idea should be presented?\n\nWe hope to partner with clients to be their stewards of courage. Our approach relies heavily on collaboration. We eschew the traditional creative process in which we ruminate on a brief, disappear for a few weeks, then have a \u201cBig Reveal\u2122\u00ae\u00a9,\u201d in a pageant often worthy of Vanna White flourishes. Ironically, I find this often more risky in that, for decades, this process is essentially a gamble that has our adrenaline pumping in hopes that the client simply \u201cgets\u201d our vision.\n\nThis is where we think we hit on something. By partnering with our clients throughout the process, with more frequent conversations and insight into the creative process, we\u2019re essentially walking alongside them through the uncharted territory together. We\u2019re like sherpas, guiding them through the adventure of discovery and innovation. Together. Not as agency-and-client.\n\nAs partners.\n\nThat settles it.\n\nThis was a profound moment in our process. We knew we wanted our clients to allow us to take risks and try new things. That\u2019s table stakes today for innovation. But we want to be courageous with them. As a trusted partner where dialogue creates ownership and accountability on both sides, we think magic can happen. With less risk in the process itself, it allows us to take more risks creatively. Neat, right?\n\nThat was it. We decided to name ourselves not after who we are, or even what we do. Rather, we focused on how we do things. We empower our clients to have courage.\n\nOur brand identity is a commitment to that process and we wanted our name to clearly and succinctly deliver on that promise.\n\nAs a result, we can confidently say, that the way we do anything \u2014 whether it\u2019s creating a story, crafting an experience, building a product or developing a brand\u2014is to do it Bravely.",

        "title": "The Core Lesson of the COVID-19 Heart Debate",
        "text": "From a virus\u2019s point of view, the heart is both an easy target and a terrible one. It is easy to reach and invade because it collects blood from all over the body and, unlike the brain, has no protective barrier. But infecting the heart also risks killing the host without triggering symptoms that would allow a virus to easily spread \u2014 coughing, sneezing, diarrhea, or vomiting. For that reason, viruses that affect only the heart \u201cdo not exist,\u201d says Efra\u00edn Rivera-Serrano, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nBut viruses can incidentally affect the heart. They do so often enough that in the Western world, they are the most common cause of myocarditis. At least 20 known viruses can trigger this condition, including those that cause influenza, Zika, dengue, and measles.\n\nThe list also includes the original SARS virus: One Toronto-based study found its genetic material in seven of 20 autopsied hearts. These hearts also had myocarditis. By contrast, autopsied hearts with traces of the new coronavirus typically don\u2019t (with some exceptions). The virus was there, but whether it was actually doing anything is unclear.\n\nBut a virus doesn\u2019t need to be in the heart to wreak havoc. It can cause indirect damage by attacking the lungs and starving the heart of oxygen, or by triggering an inflammatory immune response that affects the entire body. Even viruses that primarily affect the gut (like enteroviruses) or the respiratory system (like adenoviruses) can cause myocarditis in this way, when molecules produced at the site of infection travel through the bloodstream and inflame the heart. Coxsackie B, for example, is the most widely studied cause of viral myocarditis, but is primarily a gut virus that spreads through fecal contamination; it can infect the heart, but it does much of its damage via the immune system.\n\n\u201cTo say a virus is cardiac or vascular or respiratory simplifies things too much,\u201d says Paul Checchia, a cardiologist at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cAnytime a pathogen invades the body, the whole body reacts.\u201d SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. The immune system\u2019s response to this coronavirus can be slow to kick off, but then prolonged and severe. These immune overreactions are similar in kind to those triggered by other respiratory viruses, like influenza, but greater in degree. The heart could potentially be caught in this stronger crossfire.\n\nBut how often does that happen? In the early months of the pandemic, it seemed clear that the risk of heart injuries was \u201cdirectly proportional to the severity of the illness,\u201d says Neel Chokshi, a sports cardiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. But in July, a team led by Valentina Puntmann at University Hospital Frankfurt, in Germany, complicated that picture. The researchers showed that 78 percent of people who had recovered from COVID-19 (including many who had never been hospitalized) still had some kind of heart abnormality that was detectable on MRI scans two months later. About 60 percent still had signs of myocarditis.\n\nThe study was explosive. It spawned a wave of articles and papers about the possibility that COVID-19 could inflict stealthy and prolonged harm upon the hearts of people who aren\u2019t outwardly sick, and reportedly influenced decisions about whether college athletes should be allowed to play. These intense discussions sparked intense criticism. Other scientists slammed the study for several errors, including data that were missing, reported incorrectly, or analyzed with the wrong statistical tests. The Frankfurt team corrected its paper, and says the main conclusions still stand.\n\n\u201cI think the data are good,\u201d says Tiffany Chen of Penn Medicine, who specializes in cardiac imaging and was not involved in the study. \u201cThese were relatively healthy, mild cases of COVID-19, and they had a lot of abnormalities. It\u2019s unsettling.\u201d But the clinical implications of these findings \u2014 what they mean for COVID-19 patients whose symptoms have abated, but whose MRI scans are abnormal \u2014 aren\u2019t yet understood, she says.\n\nViral myocarditis isn\u2019t always a problem. It\u2019s entirely possible that you have had the condition at some point in your life without ever realizing it. Some people recover but have persistent scarring that weakens their heart and increases the risk of problems years down the line. And in a third group, the inflammation rapidly worsens, leading to faulty heartbeats, heart failure, or even death.\n\nThe latter two outcomes are rare, but \u201cit\u2019s really hard to give accurate percentages,\u201d says Chokshi. Doctors typically see cases of viral myocarditis only when they fall into the third group, and severe symptoms warrant MRIs and other diagnostic tests. \u201cWe don\u2019t do MRIs on everyone who has the flu, so we don\u2019t know how many have inflammation or what their long-term outcomes are,\u201d says Martha Gulati, the cardiology chief at the University of Arizona. For example, in two small pilot studies, Checchia found signs of heart damage in 40 and 55 percent of children who were hospitalized with RSV \u2014 a common respiratory virus. \u201cOn discharge, they seemed perfectly fine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t get funding to look at them months or years down the line.\u201d\n\nWithout that information, it\u2019s hard to know what to make of the Frankfurt COVID-19 study or others like it. Yes, some patients have myocarditis \u2014 but what does that mean? How do the numbers compare to other respiratory viruses? Will COVID-19 patients with myocarditis recover fully, or will some have long-term problems? Is this virus doing something strange, or are researchers just studying it more intensely than other viral infections? For now, it\u2019s difficult to say.\n\nThe worry is that COVID-19 is doing whatever it\u2019s doing at scale. The original SARS epidemic of 2003 infected only 8,000 people, killed slightly fewer than 800, and was over in three months; its impact on the heart was \u201clost in the historical bin of the scientific literature,\u201d says Checchia. SARS-CoV-2, by contrast, has infected at least 31 million people and killed at least 960,000. Its effects are thousands of times more obvious than its predecessor\u2019s. Even if it\u2019s no worse than any other viral illness, its sheer scope means that a tiny risk of severe long-term problems would still translate to a lot of failing hearts.\n\nReassuringly, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been an obvious influx of patients being admitted to the hospital with unexplained myocarditis, despite the huge numbers who have had COVID-19,\u201d says Venkatesh Murthy, a cardiologist at the University of Michigan. \u201cI don\u2019t find it convincing that there is a major amount of serious clinically relevant myocarditis in people who are feeling well.\u201d\n\nStill, he and others say that long-term studies are important. \u201cWe\u2019re still early,\u201d says Chen. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a defined time point when we\u2019d expect to see heart failure, so we have to follow these patients for months or years down the road.\u201d\n\nThat can be unnerving for people who are currently sick. Long-haulers, who are struggling with months of debilitating COVID-19 symptoms, are \u201cresponding to the media\u2019s interpretation of these studies and, to put it bluntly, are rightfully freaking out,\u201d said Kontorovich, who is part of a team that provides care for long-haulers. But for now, she sees the myocarditis issue and the long-hauler phenomenon as separate matters.\n\nSome long-haulers have been diagnosed with dysautonomia \u2014 a group of disorders that disrupt involuntary bodily functions, including heartbeats (which can become inexplicably fast) and blood pressure (which can suddenly crash). But people who have lingering heart problems after viral myocarditis don\u2019t usually experience the chronic symptoms that long-haulers do, and they typically have measurable changes to their hearts that long-haulers don\u2019t. \u201cThere may be a connection, but it hasn\u2019t been proved,\u201d Kontorovich said.\n\nCollege athletes are also facing immediate decisions. In just the past two months, the 27-year-old basketball player Michael Ojo died from a heart attack during a practice, while the 20-year-old football player Jamain Stephens Jr. died from a blood clot in his heart. Both had previously contracted COVID-19.\n\nIn a recent study, a research team at the Ohio State University scanned the hearts of 26 college athletes who tested positive for COVID-19 and had mild or absent symptoms. Four of them \u2014 15 percent \u2014 had signs of myocarditis. But the Ohio study didn\u2019t examine a control group of similar athletes who didn\u2019t have COVID-19, and even healthy athletes experience changes in their heart as they train, including features that are \u201csimilar to what you might see with infections or scarring,\u201d says Gulati, the cardiologist at the University of Arizona.\n\nIf athletes come down with clinical myocarditis \u2014 that is, with obvious signs of heart problems \u2014 they\u2019re taken out of play for at least three months to let the infection run its course and to give the heart a chance to bounce back. The question now is: What to do about the people who have subclinical myocarditis after COVID-19, which presents with no symptoms and can be seen only on a medical scanner? Chokshi, the sports cardiologist, says the risk that these abnormalities will lead to heart failure \u201cis very, very low,\u201d but \u201cthe outcome is catastrophic.\u201d The American College of Cardiology published guidance advising that all athletes who test positive for COVID-19 rest for at least two weeks, even if they show no symptoms.\n\nSetting myocarditis aside, it still makes sense to stop players from spreading the virus to one another, especially when so many colleges are facing large outbreaks. \u201cThere are plenty of reasons to not play football independent of this issue,\u201d Murthy says. \u201cWe already have plenty of evidence to take COVID-19 seriously.\u201d",

        "text": "Generating waveforms from Spotify tracks is the first problem I tackled when putting together this prototype. I ended up using the Spotify Platform\u2019s Audio Analysis endpoint to get the loudness levels of the track and then simplify that data into an array of values I could use to dynamically generate the waveform using canvas. Rather than generate this data every time a user visits the app, this prototype caches the waveform data for each visited track once for future visits.\n\nI have also provided a CodePen on how the final waveform was generated.\n\nSpotify Player\n\nTypically when I build custom Spotify player interfaces, I use their Web Playback SDK because it allows you to simply stream full tracks to premium Spotify users who authenticate with your app. The big issue with this SDK is that it doesn\u2019t work on mobile devices currently. In an attempt to make this solution more accessible, I turned to the Spotify Connect Web API. Instead of being able to stream full tracks through your web app like the Web Playback SDK, the Connect Web API allows you to remotely control an open piece of Spotify software on one of your user\u2019s devices. This API can be pretty temperamental but when it works, it\u2019s a decent solution.\n\nSpotify Comments\n\nThe comments solution I put together for this web app draws from the Spotify powered chat solution I developed for the Future Islands project. This app also uses Spotify\u2019s Implicit Grant Flow to authenticate users via a popup. Users must also be authenticated in this way to use the Connect Web API.\n\nOnce authenticated, users may tap into the text input to begin writing a message. When the input is focused, they may use an avatar slider on the waveform to position their comment on the timeline. Posted comments are sent to an awaiting Serverless endpoint and added to a DynamoDB. These comments are stored with the timestamp of their position on the timeline so they may be visually placed on the waveform again.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nFor this particular prototype, I had the thought of making the comments come through in real time like the Future Island\u2019s chat but that is likely something I\u2019ll investigate later. The point of this experiment was to further explore what social features built off the Spotify Platform could look like. Through experiments such as this and in my client work, I hope to continue to investigate this topic. I hope the information shared proves useful to you as well and I\u2019d love to hear what you think and more importantly, what you build. Happy hacking.",

        "title": "Hydroxychloroquine Probably Doesn\u2019t Work For COVID-19",
        "text": "There are some pieces that you never really expect to write. Whether it\u2019s geophagy, or people literally eating dirt, drinking blood to prevent aging, or just the ongoing saga about whether meat is deadly or perfectly curative for health, there are a lot of topics that I\u2019ve covered over the years that are, well, a bit strange.\n\nAnd yet, in some ways this feels like the strangest. If you\u2019d told me in 2019 that we\u2019d be debating the benefits of an anti-malarial medication for pandemic disease despite a mountain of evidence that it didn\u2019t work, I\u2019d probably have giggled nervously and walked away.\n\nStock photo search results for \u201cnervous\u201d are\u2026odd, to say the least. Source: Pexels\n\nWhich brings us to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). One of the strangest stories that I have ever written.\n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t work for coronavirus. We knew that some time ago. But somehow, it\u2019s still a debate to be had.\n\nThe Evidence\n\nBack in the heady days of early 2020, before we had all locked down and politicized medications, HCQ was just another drug that people thought might be useful for COVID-19. There were dozens, even hundreds, of proposed treatments, so one more drug didn\u2019t seem like a big deal \u2014 we could test it, see if it worked, and then use or discard it just like all the others.\n\nPictured: Not special. Drugs usually aren\u2019t. Source: Pexels\n\nAnd we did do those tests. Massive, well-conducted studies, with appropriate scientific controls that looked at the question of whether HCQ helped with coronavirus. The results are in, so what did they find?\n\nHydroxychloroquine probably doesn\u2019t work for coronavirus. It doesn\u2019t help people who have severe illness. It doesn\u2019t prevent illness in high-risk groups. There\u2019s no evidence it benefits people with mild disease either, even in combination with azithromycin. There\u2019s still a bit of a question mark over whether HCQ might reduce the risk of getting the disease for people who are low-risk, but the initial results are not looking good.\n\nNow, you can take those results as you like, but it\u2019s worth noting that these are really quite impressive trials. Running a properly controlled randomized study of over a thousand people in less than six months is an immensely impressive work, and the findings are both stark and uncompromising: HCQ probably doesn\u2019t benefit COVID-19, and may be harmful.\n\nAs certain right-wing pundits like to say, facts don\u2019t care about your feelings.\n\nPolitical Problems\n\nThing is, the facts aren\u2019t going to stop this debate. Our well-developed hierarchy of evidence, going from expert opinion (mostly useless) to controlled, randomized research (very useful), means very little in the face of the HCQ discussion.\n\nBecause, you see, it\u2019s not really about the science.\n\nPictured: Science, probably Source: Pexels\n\nIf it was about the science, we\u2019d have discarded HCQ months ago along with the other medications that have failed to show a benefit (anyone remember ritonavir?). Instead, we have people dividing their opinions over political lines \u2014 if you are right-wing, in certain places in the world, you support HCQ.\n\nThis is, to say the least, a very unusual state of affairs. It\u2019s rare that you have a tug-of-war between political parties about whether a drug works.\n\nThe problem, to a great degree, appears to come back to whether government interventions are necessary to combat COVID-19. People who are against lockdowns and similar interventions point to HCQ and say \u201clook, no need for the government to do anything, we have this miracle cure right here!\u201d. The fact that there are no miracle cures, and that HCQ has very little good evidence recommending it, could never get in the way of what is essentially an ideological argument.\n\nWhich is why, in the comments, you\u2019d expect to see a bunch of people calling me left-wing, a socialist, demon spawn etc. Not because I\u2019m wrong, but because the drug has taken on a life outside of the questions about whether it works or not. People will probably accuse me of being in the pockets of pharmaceutical companies because HCQ is cheap (and thus I MUST be getting paid to write this), ignoring the fact that I happily accept the similarly good evidence showing that dexamethasone can prevent death in severe cases of COVID-19 and it\u2019s cheap as chips.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s all a bit tiresome.\n\nSo, no, hydroxychloroquine probably doesn\u2019t work for COVID-19. Of course, it\u2019s possible that new evidence will come to light disproving the studies done so far, but at this point it really is quite unlikely.\n\nWe can hope that the debate will finally be laid to rest, but since it\u2019s no longer about facts it\u2019s probably never going to happen.\n\nIf you enjoyed, follow me on Medium, Twitter or Facebook!",

        "title": "How Creative Incubation Helps Your Brain Solve Challenging Problems",
        "text": "Have you ever worked on a puzzle or attempted to solve a problem to the point of frustration, only to step away for a while, take a break, and have the solution seemingly \u201cpop up\u201d out of nowhere?\n\nChances are, you\u2019ve probably had this experience at least once in life, even if it was only in regards to something trivial \u2014 such as a video game task or a minor problem at the home or office.\n\nThe world has taken to calling such moments \u201cAha!\u201d moments, and recent research suggests that rather than being a phenomenon exclusive to \u201ccreative geniuses,\u201d anyone can take steps to improve the likelihood that they will have these experiences.\n\nFor the purposes of this piece, I\u2019m interested in elaborating upon the process of \u201ccreative incubation,\u201d which is when we give our brain time to process what it has learned \u2014 away from the hard work we put in to actually \u201cfeed\u201d it information.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d moments usually arise after a period of incubation, when our brain has been given sufficient idle time to work on a problem below the surface of conscious attention, where subconscious neural processes dominate.\n\nThe tendency for our brains to discover solutions when our conscious awareness is diverted from the problem we\u2019re trying to solve has long confounded researchers and laypersons alike.\n\nHow could it be that we solve a puzzle without \u201ctrying\u201d to solve it?\n\nSurely, the more rational side of ourselves would posit that we need to work out each and every step of a solution linearly (as we would a math problem) until we arrive at the correct solution.\n\nYet that\u2019s not always what happens \u2014 even in the logical domain of math.\n\nSometimes, a difficult problem confounds even the most skilled mathematician, in which case a solution pops into her head only after she takes some time away from the whiteboard.\n\nBecause of this, our culture has tended to shroud its geniuses under a cloak of mystery. Unfortunately, this had led many to believe that the same processes that happen in their brains can\u2019t happen in their own.\n\nBecause of its mysterious quality, incubation has often been thought the most creative part of the entire process. The conscious sequences can be analyzed, to a certain extent, by the rules of logic and rationality. But what happens in the \u201cdark\u201d spaces defies ordinary analysis and evokes the original mystery shrouding the work of genius: One feels almost the need to turn to mysticism, to invoke the voice of the Muse as an explanation. \u2014 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\nModern research, however, is demystifying this process \u2014 if only a little bit.\n\nWe now know that both the more conscious, linear approach toward solving problems and the more nonlinear, subconscious element is necessary when it comes to working through difficult problems.\n\nCreative incubation is a factor in the latter element \u2014 the subconscious.\n\nBut it\u2019s necessary for me to stop right here and make one, essential clarification: there are no short-cuts or easy methods of becoming a more creative individual or a better problem solver.\n\nThe brain is a miraculous organ, one that modern science has still barely scratched the surface of when it comes to understanding its connection-making abilities.\n\nEven so, the only way to enhance our creativity and tackle difficult problems is through rigorous practice \u2014 we cannot rely on idle time or the brain\u2019s subconscious processes alone.\n\nIn other words, while it is true that our brains have an undiscovered potential, without our conscious effort to unlock that potential, we will remain stagnant.\n\nIt might be accurate to say that the \u201ctrying\u201d is as important as the \u201cnot trying.\u201d\n\nThe mathematician discovers the solution to a challenging problem only after having made the attempt to solve it at the whiteboard \u2014 and after the hours and even years of work required to learn the language of mathematics.\n\nLikewise, it is difficult to imagine anyone creating their own song using a guitar without first putting in the necessary hours it takes to master the motions needed to play the notes on the instrument with grace and precision.\n\nIn the same way, the brain \u2014 for as marvelous as it is \u2014 only gives in proportion to what it is given, by way of the time we set aside for learning new knowledge and practicing its practical applications.\n\nIn other words, for creative incubation to take place, we need to supply our brain with a whole lot of dots that it can form connections between.\n\nOtherwise, idle time is just idle time \u2014 there isn\u2019t necessarily anything productive to be gained from it.\n\nThat being said, anyone interested in practicing self-improvement, learning a new skill, or becoming a better problem-solver at home or in the workplace should be encouraged by the insights offered by recent research into the nature of creativity and how the brain produces it.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer necessary to sell ourselves short under the belief that we simply aren\u2019t \u201cintelligent\u201d enough to discover the limits of our own creative potential.\n\nWe may or may not make a huge impact on the world by becoming creative, but we can certainly make a huge impact on our own lives.\n\nSo, how can we ensure that we strike the right balance between conscious effort and subconscious idle time?\n\nWell, it helps to think about the importance of rest, relaxation, and taking breaks, even as one strives to maximize their productivity.\n\nIn our culture, we have tended to value the idea of the workaholic \u2014 someone who prizes work above all else and looks down on leisure time.\n\nIn the long run, however, denying ourselves leisure time actually hampers our creativity and problem-solving abilities.\n\nYou\u2019ll know this is true if you think back to a time you tried for hours on end to solve a difficult problem \u2014 such as fixing a household appliance, car, or something of that nature \u2014 to the point where your brain felt like mush.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced that several times over the course of my life in relation to troubleshooting computer issues or school-related problems.\n\nAt some point, we actually become less productive and more likely to make mistakes or go around in circles without ever making any progress on the task at hand.\n\nIt\u2019s when we feel to begin that way that it\u2019s time to take a break.\n\nSimply being aware of the importance of rest and relaxation \u2014 as well as society\u2019s imbalanced work culture \u2014 is enough to start getting ourselves back in touch with our more creative sides by allowing our brain the time it needs to process information and events.\n\nAlthough it sounds like something a workaholic would do, it can be helpful to think of rest time as being worthy of its own spot on our schedules.\n\nSetting aside a few hours a week to simply do nothing, or enjoy some passive entertainment \u2014 such as Netflix or scrolling through social media \u2014 isn\u2019t a bad thing provided said time is used intelligently to make our self-improvement practice more holistic.\n\nBetter yet, we could take breaks by doing activities that are less passive yet still considered \u201cleisurely\u201d \u2014 such as playing a musical instrument.\n\nAs long as we enjoy the activity such that it feels like a break from what we consider to be \u201cwork,\u201d then it can be considered idle time.\n\nThen who knows?\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll start having more \u201cAha!\u201d moments yourself!\n\nJust remember to always have healthy expectations.\n\nAs Mihaly points out, the more significant the problem we are trying the solve, the more conscious work we will need to put in to give our brain enough material with which to produce a solution.\n\nHow long a period of incubation is needed varies depending on the nature of the problem. It may range from a few hours to several weeks and even longer. \u2014 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\nFixing a minor computer glitch is one thing, figuring out a coherent, testable theory of quantum gravity is quite another.\n\nThe former might require that we only take a fifteen-minute break to rest up before going back at it, whereas the latter might take a person\u2019s entire lifetime in conjunction with the lifetimes of several other people who have worked on the same problem.\n\nOne thing is clear, however.\n\nIn order to \u201cexercise\u201d our creativity, we need to make sure that our conscious efforts to solve problems and produce novel ideas are balanced with ample leisure time in which our brain\u2019s subconscious neural activities can work on the same problem \u201cbeneath the surface\u201d so to speak.\n\nSo when thinking about our self-improvement/productivity journeys, we need to value both dedicated learning and practice, as well as the leisure time our brain needs to form new connections.\n\nIf you ask me, that\u2019s the best of both worlds!\n\nI think few people want all of their time to feel \u201cleisurely.\u201d On the flip side, most people don\u2019t want their entire lives to feel like \u201cwork.\u201d\n\nLuckily for us, creativity dwells between these seemingly opposed poles.\n\nWe have only to shift between them.",

        "text": "Hybrid Cloud Strategy brings the best of both worlds into the realm of cloud computing. Here, you can use both public and private clouds in your infrastructure. While developing the services for this kind of architecture, one thing to keep in mind is their interoperability. That means services on the public cloud should seamlessly work with the services that reside on the private cloud and vice versa.\n\nOnce the interoperability of services is taken care of, it opens the door to countless benefits that you can get from this type of hybrid implementation. You can utilize the scalability and portability of the public cloud infrastructure, while at the same time, maintaining the security of the sensitive data of the company, firewalled against in your private cloud on-premise.\n\nChoosing the right combination of clouds\n\nThe selection of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider is dependent on your usage type. There are multiple numbers of criteria that one may need to look at before choosing an ideal provider. Some of which are -\n\nRobustness of the platform Security on the network Whether they are following best practices or not Their SLA Flexibility for the developers How easily the integration can be done Interoperability with the private or other cloud platforms Usability Functionality\n\nThe order of these criteria entirely depends on your use case. To rearrange this list according to your priority.\n\n\u201cMoving Computation is Cheaper than moving data\u201d\n\nOnce you are using the cloud, you will be storing a huge amount of data online. According to the principle of \u201ccode moving to data\u201d, if your code is smaller (which typically is) as compared to the data you have, It is wise to move your code to the cloud rather than moving your data to the code.\n\nBy moving code to the cloud, every node will be able to replicate it for its own execution independent of others. Hence it will decrease any latency significantly because there is no need to send code on demand.\n\nObservability, Monitoring, and Analytics\n\nWhen you are running an IT business as complex as a nation, you need an eagle\u2019s eye to capture every detail of what\u2019s happening within your workflow. And this comes with the integration of the right tools into your infrastructure. Tools that can help you track a system\u2019s health in microseconds, so whenever any catastrophe happens, you know where to look.\n\nIn any case, as I said prior, we are managing the \u201ccomplex\u201d frameworks here. That implies we will manage the BigData. Each endeavor has its own inclinations and nobody needs to be controlled by the pre-planned UI given by a product.\n\nHenceforth, you should search for stages that can furnish you with an adaptable lightweight UI where the portrayal of factual or authentic information is in your own hands. Tools that let you structure incredible dashboards for continuous synopsis and summarizations.\n\nAlong with all this, drill-down capabilities for exploring multi-dimensional data is crucial in any reporting tool for gaining more helpful insights. This feature not only reduces the load from the server by not sending all of the data at once but also helps us see the bigger picture.",

        "text": "But, even though we don\u2019t evenly distribute all of our activities amongst all our devices, we still do a little of everything on all our devices. Maybe we do most of our social media on our phone, but we also do a lot of social media on our laptop. Maybe we do most of our email on our computer, but we also do email on our tablet.\n\nThe problem with this is, it exposes us to path dependency, gone rogue. If we take a wrong turn, we end up on the wrong road. Once we\u2019re on the wrong road, it takes that much longer to get where we\u2019re trying to go.\n\nThink of it this way: You can do a lot of things with a toothbrush. You can scrub your teeth with a toothbrush. You can also scrub your toilet with a toothbrush. But would you scrub your teeth and your toilet with the same brush? No!\n\nSo why use the same device to do two things that are completely at odds with one another? Why surf the web with the same device you use to write? Why chat with your friends on the same device you use to meditate?\n\nYou need to split up. You need a Device Divorce. You need to make it easy to get to the places you want to go, and hard take a wrong turn to the places you don\u2019t want to go.\n\nA simple exercise to begin your Device Divorce\n\nTo begin a Device Divorce, try this exercise: Draw three columns on a piece of paper. At the top of each of the respective three columns, write laptop, tablet, and smartphone. Now, in the respective column, write down the activities that you primarily do on each of these devices.\n\nDo you see any contradictions? If you go down one path to do one of these things, will that take you farther and farther from another path to do another thing?\n\nWill it break your focus? Will it dampen your momentum? Will it alter your mental state to go down Instagram Alley instead of Scrivener Circle?\n\nIf so, you aren\u2019t using your devices, your devices are using you.\n\nNext, make a decision. Decide what activities you will do on each of the three devices. But, just as important, decide which activities you will not do on each of these three devices.\n\nMy personal device arsenal\n\nMe, I do most of my writing on my iPad, with an external keyboard. I do not do email on my iPad. I do not do messaging on my iPad.\n\nI try to do as much email as I can on my iPhone. But, I don\u2019t have Twitter or Facebook installed on my iPhone. I\u2019d be taking wrong turns, left and right.\n\nMy laptop, I simply try to limit its usage as much as possible. My laptop is a \u201cslippy\u201d tool. Too many side roads and detours.\n\nYour Device Divorce doesn\u2019t have to stop at your primary electronic devices. According to a poll I did on Twitter, three out of four of you already have an extra tablet or smartphone just lying around.\n\nThese old devices often can\u2019t run the latest software (thank you, planned obsolescence).

        "title": "Can I Write One Good Sentence?",
        "text": "Can I Write One Good Sentence?\n\nThe brilliant advice F. Scott Fitzgerald never actually gave\n\nPhoto by Peter Pryharski on Unsplash\n\nIn the early 20th century, the most important man in the world of American literature wasn\u2019t an author. His name was Maxwell Perkins.\n\nPerkins was an editor at Scribner, a publishing house in New York City. In 1919, he signed a young, unknown author, making a big bet on aspiring talent against the will of his seniors at the company. The author he signed was F. Scott Fitzgerald, who would go on to write and publish The Great Gatsby in cooperation with Perkins.\n\nOne year after Gatsby, which wouldn\u2019t sell well for the next 15 years, Perkins met and signed another author of questionable status: Ernest Hemingway. After the two books they worked on together \u2014 The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms \u2014 found commercial successes, Perkins became the most sought after editor in the country.\n\nThe 2016 movie Genius tells the story of Perkins and another prodigious discovery of his: Thomas Wolfe. Wolfe was the son Perkins, who had five daughters, always longed for. He was poetic, passionate, and notoriously incapable of cutting a single word from his flowery prose. In other words, he was a writer through and through.\n\nAs an editor, one of Perkins\u2019 main responsibilities was to cut the inessential. He did so for all of his writers but for none more than Wolfe. His first novel, Look Homeward, Angel, went from 294,000 words to 234,000 under Perkins\u2019 guidance \u2014 and it sold like hotcakes. Taking the feedback of \u201cwrite more\u201d a bit too literally, Wolfe turned around and produced another manuscript: The 5,000-page draft for Of Time and the River, which him and Perkins fought over for two years before it finally saw the light of day.\n\nThen, despite the book\u2019s success, a trauma befell Wolfe that catches every writer at some point: Wolfe got writer\u2019s block. For months, he was unable to put pen to paper. Eventually, he took a long, solo trip all the way to California, where, among other things, he visited Fitzgerald. I doubt the scene played out as depicted in the movie, but the advice he gave Wolfe \u2014 no doubt inspired by Perkins\u2019 dedication as an editor \u2014 is priceless nonetheless:\n\nThomas Wolfe: \u201cMore and more I trouble myself with that, the legacy. Will anyone care about Thomas Wolfe in 100 years? 10 years?\u201d F. Scott Fitzgerald: \u201cWhen I was young, I asked myself that question everyday. Now, I ask myself, \u2018Can I write one good sentence?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor any writer, there are more ifs and thens and whats and whens to obsess over than hours in the day. What if no one cares about my idea? Will the book sell once it\u2019s out? When can I make a living from my craft? What does it all amount to? Will I leave behind a legacy? There is no quicker way to obliterate your ability to chain words together than to hop on this never-ending merry-go-round of hypotheticals.\n\nInstead, as Perkins drilled into his authors when fighting with them over every word, as Fitzgerald finally realized after years of failure, dedicate your obsession to the micro. Forget the book, the chapter, even the page and the very next paragraph. Ask one question and one question alone. The only question that matters: Can I write one good sentence?\n\nEven if the encounter was fictional, even if Fitzgerald never said these words, there\u2019s a high chance he had internalized them regardless. How do I know? Well, the other grand disciple of Perkins, Hemingway, left us with the exact same advice. It\u2019s a famous line that\u2019s been quoted countless times: \u201cWrite the truest sentence that you know.\u201d\n\nWhat did this mean for Hemingway? He explains it to us in the paragraph the quote is from \u2014 the majority of which most quoters omit:\n\nSometimes when I was starting a new story and could not get it going, I would sit in front of the fire and squeeze the peel of the little oranges into the edge of the flame and watch the sputter of blue that they made. I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, \u201cDo not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.\u201d So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there.\n\nAs Nick Wignall notes, it is the throwing-orange-peel-into-the-fire part that is most crucial to understanding the advice. \u201cThat was his one true sentence that lead to his now famous \u2018Write one true sentence\u2019 quote,\u201d Wignall writes. It was the only thing he knew to be true at the time: When I have writer\u2019s block, I toss fruit into a fire. So that\u2019s where he began.\n\nYour next, first, final sentence being true is all nice and well, but, going back to Fitzgerald\u2019s version of the tip, we now must ask: Is it also a good sentence?\n\nUndoubtedly, Hemingway\u2019s messy eating habits meet those criteria. There\u2019s color, there\u2019s fruit, there\u2019s fire. Fire is dangerous. Fruit is a symbol of life. The colors change, and so does the situation. Feeding orange peel to the flames is not an everyday occurrence. See how many more metaphors we already extracted from this one line? You can imagine the scene as funny \u2014 an enraged Hemingway hurling oranges into his fireplace \u2014 or deeply thoughtful \u2014 the mindless flick of a finger causes a blue spark and loud crackle as Hemingway turns back to his desk. That is one heck of a sentence. Did Hemingway know when he wrote it? Doubtful. But he trusted the truth, and he deliberated on it long enough to stick with his decision \u2014 and that made all the difference.\n\nUnfortunately for Wolfe, he never got to practice the advice he received from Fitzgerald. Weeks after his visit, he died of tuberculosis at just 37 years old. He did, however, leave behind a legacy \u2014 and a letter to his former editor, Maxwell Perkins:\n\nI shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\n\nNow that\u2019s a good sentence. I think you should write one.",

        "title": "Decapitating Consciousness",
        "text": "I believe I am as conscious as anyone. When I am awake and my eyes are open, I see a stable, colorful, and continuous world all around me, and that world doesn\u2019t wobble when my eyes move. This fact alone suggests that I am experiencing consciousness, because what I am perceiving transcends the visual signals my retinas are receiving. Those signals are messy, in part because eyes move almost continuously and in part because the retina includes an area \u2014 the scotoma \u2014 that doesn\u2019t react to light; it is a blind spot that is somehow getting filled in by my brain.\n\nMy other senses also help me perceive a rich and orderly world which is, I am fairly sure, being constructed by my brain \u2014 more evidence that I am \u201cconscious.\u201d I am also reasonably good \u2014 as good as one can be, anyway, which isn\u2019t very good \u2014 at picturing things from my past: people I used to know, places I have visited, the room I slept in when I was four. I can also imagine things I have never seen, even things that could never exist: the Eiffel Tower upside-down, Donald Trump with three heads, a line of people a mile long waiting to take advantage of the free food offer at the Russian Tea Room in New York (now there is a fantasy).\n\nI also talk to myself a great deal. And, yes, I also experience a wide range of feelings \u2014 as wide, I believe, as anyone feels. At the moment, I am mainly feeling nervous about all the criticism I will get from various \u201cexperts\u201d about the content of the essay I am now writing.\n\nSo, do I qualify? Do I seem to you to be conscious, or at least to be a good liar who knows what to say to convince people I am conscious? Let\u2019s assume the former, at least for the moment, so I can get on with things.\n\nMy world has always been full of mysteries, such as: What happens to the thousands of tons of rubber that wear off the tires of our cars and trucks every year? Why isn\u2019t it piling up on the sides of our roads, blocking the views of our houses? And: If I hang upside down every day, will I get taller or at least stop shrinking as I get older?\n\nFor much of my adult life, I have also wondered about something that is supposed to be mysterious but that has never seemed so to me: Why, for centuries, have people considered consciousness to be something beyond human understanding? Now don\u2019t get me wrong. By \u201cpeople,\u201d I don\u2019t mean people in general. Most people don\u2019t think much about consciousness, other than having some dim awareness of the fact that alcohol and drugs screw it up and, of course, that sleep or a good head bashing temporarily turn it off. And then there is death, of course.\n\nNo, by \u201cpeople,\u201d I mean a special class of people who are paid \u2014 at least a few of them are paid \u2014 to sit around and think about everything and then debate each other about their thoughts and then, in some cases, train other people to think about things exactly the same way they do. You know, academics.\n\nFor at least two millennia now, such people, and especially the philosophers among them, have insisted (a) that consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries in the world and (b) that they have solved or at least shed light on this mystery, each in his or her own special way. I could at this point try to impress you with what a dedicated scholar I am by summarizing and then criticizing the views of Aristotle and Augustine, Dennett and Descartes, Heidegger and Hume, Hegel and Nagel, Kant and Carnap, James and Jaynes, Plato and Penrose, Russell and Ryle, and on and on and on. The list of scholars who have weighed in on consciousness is so impressive and diverse that sometimes I think people write about consciousness just to get on a list with Plato and Aristotle on it. Perhaps that is why I am writing this article now!\n\nInstead of slogging through the list, however, I will simply suggest you watch a popular 2014 TED talk by the Australian philosopher, David Chalmers \u2014 perhaps the leading consciousness expert in the world. In a mere 18 minutes, he will confirm three things for you: (a) that he believes consciousness is \u201cthe most mysterious phenomenon in the universe\u201d (not just one of the most mysterious phenomena, and not just on planet Earth), (b) that \u201cwe are well on our way to a serious theory\u201d of consciousness \u2014 a statement he has repeated in various forms for more than 20 years now, and, unfortunately, (c) that he actually has no idea what consciousness is or how it works. At least that is I how interpret the video; you make up your own mind.\n\nChalmers is a champion of the \u201cpanpsychism\u201d view of consciousness, according to which consciousness is a property of everything in the universe \u2014 and since we are part of the universe \u2014 well, there you are. Got it? He also says consciousness is like \u201ca movie playing in your head.\u201d And then there is Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose\u2019s neural theory of consciousness, according to which consciousness arises from the vibrations of millions of microtubules in the neurons of the brain. Philosopher Patricia Churchland has labeled this the \u201cpixie dust\u201d theory of consciousness, which I think sums up the flaws of the theory nicely. How does moving consciousness to small structures in brain cells shed any light on it?\n\nConsciousness theorists routinely commit at least one of three analytical errors when formulating their theories \u2014 often, all three. The first is the reification error. That is when we start to treat some phenomenon as a thing, even though it is not. When Einstein and his contemporaries began speculating about the existence of subatomic particles, they were not committing this error; they believed these particles existed, and subsequent research confirmed their speculations in some respects. When we start to treat \u201cconsciousness\u201d as a thing, however, we are reifying. Consciousness is not a thing, a place, or a world \u2014 more on this later.\n\nThe second error is autocentrism, which I define as excessive focusing on the experience of being \u201cme.\u201d Humans have routinely impeded the progress of science by putting some aspect of themselves into the center of things. In the 1600s, Galileo was punished by the Catholic Church for defending Copernicus\u2019 assertion that the earth is not the center of the universe (\u201cgeocentrism\u201d). \u201cEurocentrism,\u201d which, among other things, means imposing European values on the rest of the world, has distorted thinking and theories in anthropology, sociology, literature, and other fields. Psychology, my own field, was troubled by another kind of centrism called \u201canthropomorphism\u201d \u2014 the attributing of human characteristics to nonhumans. We just love focusing on ourselves, sometimes to our detriment.\n\nThe third error is an extreme form of autocentrism I call cognicentrism: focusing specifically on the importance of one\u2019s own cognitive experiences, as if one\u2019s thought processes had some special significance. Modern scientific psychology was launched in 1879 by a cognicentric German scientist named Wilhelm Wundt, who believed that a science of cognition was possible. Wundt, in turn, had been influenced by the work of another German scientist, Gustav Fechner, who had been searching since the mid1800s for laws of \u201cpsychophysics\u201d \u2014 laws relating the mental world to the physical (Chalmers said he too was searching for \u201cpsychophysical laws\u201d in an article he published in 1995).\n\nCognicentrism is the most pernicious of the three errors. Some academics are so fascinated by their own internal movie \u2014 it is in full color, after all, with 3-D and surround sound \u2014 they think it must be real, never considering a much simpler and more sensible possibility.\n\nAs an exercise, please set aside for the moment the questionable assertion that consciousness is a thing or a place or a world or a movie; in other words, resist the temptation to reify. Also, please consider the possibility that the fact that you seem to have a strong sense of being you is not actually a big deal \u2014 not big enough to build a science around, anyway. Finally, even though you seem to have a movie playing in your head, please entertain the idea that there really is no movie in your head (because there isn\u2019t) and that your conscious experiences might not be as important as you think they are. In other words, as best you can, please set aside any autocentric or cognicentric inclinations you might have.\n\nThis brings me, finally, to what I am pretty sure consciousness actually is. Following the tradition of the many great sages who have gotten us so confused about consciousness, I will explain my perspective initially through an analogy \u2014 let\u2019s call it The Hot Tub Harry Analogy.\n\nHot Tub Harry is sitting up to his neck in hot water. He can feel the heat, the flow of the water around him, the bubbles \u2014 even, let\u2019s say, the texture of the water, which is a bit oily. To simplify matters, we shall plug his ears and nose and cover his eyes, so that most of the stimulation he is receiving is coming from receptor cells in his skin. He and the water form a kind of system, like a fetus does with a womb.\n\nA few feet away from this hot-tub system (HTS) stands a scientist who is speculating about what it is like to experience life in the HTS. She is not having much luck, though, because she has never been in a hot tub and is not part of Harry\u2019s HTS. She can see the system from afar, but she is not part of it. She can see vapor rising from the water, which suggests the water is hot, but she cannot feel the water. She can see bubbles and signs of currents, but she cannot feel them. Moreover, no matter how closely she examines the system from the outside, she cannot say anything about what it is like to be part of the system. Meanwhile, Harry has no trouble at all feeling exactly what it is like to be part of the system. There is, in general, an enormous difference between being an integral part of a system and being outside a system.\n\nOur brains are not only part of our bodies, they are also wired directly to it, including to all of our sense organs. Light entering our eyes stimulates light-sensitive cells on our retinas, which in turn stimulate nerve cells that connect to our brain through a bundle of nerve fibers. A fraction of a second later, through a process that is not yet understood, neural processes allow us to see a stable and continuous version of the world around us. The visual part of what we call our \u201cconsciousness\u201d is our experience of seeing that world. Our brain also manages to integrate much of the chaotic and noisy stimulation that surrounds us into coherent wholes; in fact, as the research of Gestalt psychologists demonstrated a century ago, our brain seems almost driven to create wholes from parts and order from chaos. We have two eyes, after all, sending two somewhat different stimulus patterns into our brain, which somehow manages to coordinate them.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. The scotoma is present in all vertebrates, and so are two eyes. Given the superb eye-limb coordination that is evident throughout the animal kingdom, it would appear that brains have evolved to stabilize images, fill in gaps, and organize and simplify stimuli. No matter what the species, the owners of brains that did not do such things would have quickly been culled from the gene pool. Imagine a saber-toothed tiger that had to prowl around its environment using the unsmoothed, rapidly shifting, incomplete, somewhat differing images being projected onto the retinas of its two eyes; even if, by some miracle, it managed to find its prey, the prey might have eaten it long before it managed to eat its prey.\n\nThe fact that we do not yet understand how the brain accomplishes these transformations is not important. Consciousness is the observational experience we have after these transformations have taken place.\n\nSo, getting back to Harry, he can, through receptor cells in his skin, feel properties of the water, and he can also observe himself feeling properties of the water. He is built not only to sense properties of the world around him (which are then smoothed by the brain in various ways), he is also built to observe some aspects of his own functioning. Remarkably, he can also visualize events from his past while sitting in the hot tub \u2014 even fantasize about things that have never occurred.\n\nWe experience different degrees of consciousness, of course. When Harry starts to get drowsy from the hot water, his consciousness fades, which is to say he observes less and less about the surrounding environment and about his own observational experience. He might also adapt to some aspects of his environment, which means, by definition, that his awareness of those aspects of his environment dims; over time, for example, he will probably get used to the temperature of the water. Harry also has some control over what properties of his environment and experience he pays attention to. When he pays close attention to what he is experiencing in the moment, we might say he is highly conscious of what is around him. If his thoughts drift to other matters, we might say he is only dimly conscious of what is around him.\n\nNo matter how you cut the cake, consciousness is simple observation \u2014 either of properties of the environment around us or of properties of our own experience, both past and present. Although it is true that Hot Tub Harry\u2019s conscious experiences while he sits in the tub are not accessible to the observer outside the tub, they are by no means mysterious.\n\nPerhaps you will object: Hold on! you say. The analogy is flawed! Harry is a person with sense organs and a brain! All you have done is push the problem of consciousness to another location, just as Hameroff and Penrose did when they attributed consciousness to the vibrations of microtubules.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t done yet! Let\u2019s work on Harry a bit \u2014 nothing too drastic, just a minor surgical modification: Let\u2019s get rid of his body, leaving his brain and skin receptors in the water. We shall also add nutrients to the water to keep his tissue healthy. Because Harry\u2019s brain and skin receptors are alive in the HTS/nutrient bath, he is presumably still conscious of the properties of the water \u2014 the currents, the temperature, the bubbles \u2014 even still free to let his attention wander to other matters. We can prove that the bodiless Harry has been conscious by sewing his brain and skin receptors back into his body and asking him about his recent experience. Were you conscious during our experiment, Harry? Hell yes, he replies, and is all this stitching going to leave any scars? He can even describe the experience for us. This is part of the wonder of the human brain: our ability to re-live past experiences to some extent \u2014 to re-member (from the Latin re, \u201cagain\u201d, and memorari, \u201cbe mindful of\u201d).\n\nBut consciousness itself is not mysterious. Hot Tub Harry\u2019s consciousness was nothing more than his active observation of both his environment and his cognitive activities while his brain was immersed in a nutrient bath and connected to a sense organ.\n\nBut where, you ask, is Harry in all this? Who or what is doing all this observing? Is Harry a little homunculus hidden somewhere in his brain? Absolutely not. There is no homunculus, and there is also no Harry. The entity that calls itself \u201cHarry\u201d is just a curious property of this entity\u2019s consciousness \u2014 a kind of bonus that comes from our ability to remember our past: Although our brains change continuously throughout our lives, the changes are generally small enough so that we retain a sense of continuity from one minute to the next, even from one year to the next. The sense of continuity creates the illusion of \u201cself\u201d or \u201cI\u201d or \u201cme.\u201d\n\nAs real as the self feels, however, it is truly just an illusion \u2014 one that is vulnerable to disruption. Psychedelic drugs, a head injury, oxygen deprivation, mental illness, disease and aging can all degrade the sense of self, even obliterate it completely. I have met people in clinical settings who have completely lost their sense of self; it is painfully sad. Are such people conscious? Yes, but because they have no identity and very little past, their conscious experience is limited mainly to the observation of their current environment.\n\nAlthough the self is an illusion, consciousness is not, and, contrary to popular opinion, it is also not \u201csubjective.\u201d To call it so demeans the experience unjustifiably. Seeing is quite real; it has clear physical correlates that can be measured. The fact that the owner of the brain who is doing the seeing has an experience no one else can share is beside the point; his or her experience is no less real. The experience is distinct mainly because the brain owner is part of the system that is doing the seeing. The experience is also a bit odd because the owner, being part of the system, can not only see; he or she can also see him- or herself seeing. The physical correlates of his or her self-observation might be hard to find, but they are presumably findable.\n\nSo here is my question for you: Are you something more than a brain floating in a nutrient bath and connected to a body and sense organs \u2014 an organic system that interacts with the world? If so, how exactly are you something more, and how can you prove that?\n\nThe model I am describing may not be attractive (except for the hot tub, maybe), but I believe it accounts fully for consciousness, at least as I experience it. Consciousness is the brain owner\u2019s experience of observing the world and his or her own body and behavior. This experience seems remarkable mainly because of the convenient ways the brain irons out stimuli, but the smoothing process, as I said, is almost certainly an evolutionary imperative for the brains of many species. The brain stabilizes images, fills in gaps, and sometimes integrates separate stimuli into orderly wholes, but none of these things is miraculous. We build cameras that stabilize images and software applications that integrate and transform diverse media components any way we like. If we can build such things, so can evolution.\n\nAs for the \u201cunconscious\u201d \u2014 the mythical, reified world popularized by Sigmund Freud \u2014 while we are capable of observing the world around us and some aspects of our own behavior and cognitive activity, our observation powers are also limited. We behave and change and learn all the time without explicitly observing such things, and we also are terrible at explaining why we behave as we do. Our limited abilities are just that. They are not evidence that another world \u2014 an \u201cunconscious\u201d one \u2014 exists to complement the non-existent \u201cconscious\u201d world. Reifying our observational experience was bad enough; inventing yet another non-physical world to explain what our observations can\u2019t make sense of is truly absurd.\n\nThis brings me to Henry and Tiny Bryan, my family\u2019s cat and dog, respectively. The never-ending and largely pointless debate about the nature of consciousness has occasionally been extended to animals. Are animals conscious? I cannot share the conscious experiences of Henry or Tiny Bryan any more than I can share yours, but I have no doubt that virtually all vertebrates are conscious very much as humans are. If they can observe the world around them, if they can observe their own bodies, and if they show signs of being able to remember things, then they are conscious \u2014 lacking only the linguistic tools to reflect upon and analyze their existence. Charles Darwin said as much in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872).\n\nIn some respects, some non-human animals are probably more conscious than we are, either because their sense organs are more sensitive or because they have senses we lack. Some birds can directly detect properties of the earth\u2019s magnetic field; elephants can detect subtle seismic signals; sharks, platypuses, and electric eels can sense electrical fields. What we have in common with all of them is that each of us is a brain floating in a nutrient bath and connected to a body and sense organs. Whatever the species, the brain owner in such a system is probably conscious during most of its waking hours.\n\nAlas, even with all the extra cortical tissue that distinguishes us from lesser beings in the animal kingdom, humans do not think clearly. We are highly prone to errors of thinking \u2014 reification, autocentrism, and cognicentrism being just three of our many weaknesses. We are easily swayed, especially by authority figures, and once we have adopted some belief, we attend selectively to evidence that supports that belief, no matter how shoddy it may be (a phenomenon called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d). This means that the perspective I have described in this essay will not only be difficult for many people to accept, it will also draw criticism from \u201cexperts\u201d whose careers, reputations, and livelihoods depend on defending their own positions, no matter how weak, cumbersome, or absurd. (The whole universe is conscious? Give me a break.) Over the course of the 40 years since I entered graduate school in psychology, I have known of only one major figure in my field who recanted a theory he had been staunchly defending for much of his career \u2014 more than 20 years in this case. This remarkable shift was an exception to the rule; when academicians develop and defend a theory, it is almost always to the death.\n\nAlthough I think I am right about consciousness, I do not expect people to rally round me in support. Our immediate experience, combined with a long history of brainwashing \u2014 um, sorry, I mean education \u2014 tells us, mistakenly, that consciousness is both mysterious and non-physical and that our \u201cself\u201d is every bit as real as our driver\u2019s license. Immediate experience, again combined with brainwashing, also told people for millennia that the world was flat, and millions of people still believe that today. We may be conscious, but are we smart enough to admit what consciousness really is?",

By trying to ensure maintainability, scalability, and all the other -ilities, we\u2019re trying to create software that can stand the test of time. It\u2019s just good sense. However, there are more perspectives involved than just technical sustainability.\n\nVarious academic papers have actually identified four perspectives for sustainable software:\n\nEconomic sustainability\n\nEnvironmental sustainability\n\nSocial sustainability\n\nTechnical sustainability\n\nThese might not be all-encompassing, but they cover the majority of software-related sustainability concerns.",

        "text": "How Weighted Blankets Can Help Improve Your Mental Health\n\nSleep is closely related to our mental state\n\nPhoto by The-Lore.com on Unsplash\n\nSleep is closely related to our mental state. When we aren\u2019t able to sleep well, we are often more easily frustrated and experience a drop in productivity. When lack of sleep (or poor quality sleep) occurs for prolonged periods, we might even start to feel a strain on our mental health.\n\nAmongst methods like using calming essential oils, yoga, and sleeping pills, weighted blankets are a common solution many have turned to in an effort to solve their sleep-related woes.\n\nWhat is a weighted blanket?\n\nIn short, a weighted blanket is a heavy blanket that weighs anywhere between 5 pounds to 30 pounds (around 2 kilograms to 13.5 kilograms).\n\nOriginally devised to help older children that fall on the autism spectrum, weighted blankets have also helped improve sleep quality.\n\nWeighted blankets can be used to help reduce anxiety and stress, making it a great way for one to subtly improve one\u2019s mental health without having to make radical changes in one\u2019s lifestyle.\n\nThe benefits of using weighted blankets\n\nA weighted blanket applies a \u201cdeep pressure\u201d on the user, engaging a kind of stimulation called Deep Touch Pressure (DTP) Stimulation. When studied, DTP provides positive effects by reducing the anxiety one feels. Furthermore, the weighted blanket helps users feel relaxed and more comfortable, helping improve sleep quality.\n\nApart from reducing anxiety, DTP encourages our bodies to release oxytocin. This hormone works to help with stress coping, allowing one to relax and fostering a positive mood.\n\nThe use of weighted chain blankets by patients with diagnosed psychiatric disorders was found to help significantly with insomnia, allowing the patients to reduce the fatigue, depression, and anxiety felt during the day, resulting in an increase in daytime activity level.\n\nIs a weighted blanket suitable for me?\n\nWhile I hope everyone can enjoy the benefits of a weighted blanket and be able to sleep in the warm hug of one, it\u2019s not suitable for everyone.\n\nIndividuals with sleep apnea, respiratory problems, claustrophobia, and other chronic medical conditions should check with a trained medical professional before using the blanket.\n\nAlso, a weighted blanket should not be used for young children.",

        "text": "The day the product team is established, it is behind schedule and over its budget. Don Norman\n\nHow often do we encounter situations when, after learning useful information, we forget about it before we have time to put it into practice?\n\nBelow I have collected tips, thoughts and ideas based on the notes I have gathered over the past few years from the books, articles, courses I have studied.\n\nThe notes cover multiple areas, because fortunately over the past ten years I have been in different roles.\n\nA significant part of the points is universal, but the focus is still on working on web projects from the beginning to the end.\n\nAlso, depending on the size of the projects, some items may not be adequate or applicable.\n\nSince I gathered here the thoughts and ideas of some of the best people of the industry, I partly borrowed the title for the article from Tim Ferriss and his great book Tools Of Titans.\n\nContents\n\nIdeas\n\nDesign:\n\n* Base ideas\n\n* Technical tips and tricks\n\n* Accessibility\n\nArchitecture\n\nProject work:\n\n* Cognitive biases and mental models\n\n* Communications\n\n* Hiring\n\nDevelopment:\n\n* Refactoring\n\nSecurity\n\nIdeas\n\nGenerate a lot of ideas at once. Don\u2019t stop on one or two ideas.\n\nBe creative, no matter what the circumstances. Don\u2019t criticize ideas, either yours or someone else\u2019s. Even crazy ideas, that often seem obviously wrong, may contain some kind of creative thought. Separate the stages of idea generation from the stages of idea evaluation. Do not give up ideas too early.\n\nLimited time to generate ideas leads to hyper focusing and under these conditions it is easier to separate the phases of idea generation and evaluation, as there is no time to evaluate.\n\nSometimes you can add restrictions or remove existing ones to change the process.\n\nFears that interfere with creativity:\n\nFear seems stupid.\n\nFear of bad ideas.\n\nFear that you\u2019re doing something the wrong way. Evaluating how people do their job should not be based on whether they do it your way, but on how effective their way is. If a person does something and succeeds, don\u2019t try to retrain them.\n\nFear of the unknown.\n\nFear of not liking others doing something.\n\nFear that you\u2019re not as good as you think.\n\nFear of impostor syndrome (you know less than others).\n\nDesign\n\nThis section is the most difficult for me, because I am not a professional designer, but at the same time it is one of the most useful, because this is where the value of this format manifests itself. When you can go through the points and become more productive in design discussions or applying ideas to work on your own projects.\n\nBase Ideas\n\nRemember that despite the rapid change in technology, human behavior is not changing so fast. And the way we acted 20 years ago is still relevant. See, for example, the latest report [how-people-read-online] (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/).\n\nUse design instead of functional specifications, that only create the illusion of agreement. People read one text and understand it differently.\n\nPay no attention to the details at the beginning of the process. Move from big to small. Start with design and layout. They\u2019re much easier to change than code. In design, start with the epicenter.\n\nAffordances and anti-affordances of things must be obvious.\n\nWhen affordances and anti-affordances are hard to detect, we must supplement the object with signifiers.\n\nRelated elements should be placed together. Put the controls and important information exactly where they are needed.\n\nFeedback should be instant: a delay of even a tenth of a second can make a person nervous. If the delay lasts too long, people often give up and go do something else.\n\nIf there is too much feedback, it can annoy even more than if there is too little feedback. If we hear too many messages, we ignore them all or turn off everything. And that means we\u2019re likely to miss really important messages.\n\nRemove all error messages. Instead, provide users with help and guidance. Make sure that you can fix the problem right away with the tooltips.\n\nDon\u2019t expect people to save anything in short-term memory. Often, when something goes wrong, computer systems show a message with important information that disappears from the screen at the moment when a person wants to read it.\n\nAvoid algorithms that start out the same way and then become different. The more experienced the employee is, the more likely he is to fall victim to such a miss. Whenever possible, the algorithms should be prescribed so they differ from each other from the beginning.\n\nDuring the testing stage it is enough to interview 5 independent people/groups to get an adequate review. You can start with the other team members. Use open questions when testing.\n\nDo not collect unnecessary information that you do not use now.\n\nPeople often choose the first satisfactory option rather than looking for the best one. Our ideas about how things work are often wrong, so when we understand how something works, we do not look for an alternative solution, even if the current one is bad.\n\nSteal like an artist. Use these sites for inspiration: (dribble, pinterest, pttrns).\n\nStandardization is a fundamental principle of the desperate: when any other solution seems impossible, just design everything in the same way so, that people can learn something once and for all. For example:\n\nA logo is in the upper left corner.\n\nFamiliar icons for the basket, videos, etc.\n\nWays to reduce errors:\n\nMake the element, that the user is working with, more visible. Change the appearance of the object, make it more noticeable: increase it or change its color.\n\nAdd \u201cundo\u201d function for your operations.\n\nAdd reasonability checks.\n\nTechnical tips and tricks\n\nTake into account normal, empty, and erroneous states in the design. Empty state makes the first impression, so it is very important.\n\nImplement a light and dark theme.\n\nDon\u2019t set too strict restrictions on entering form fields. Especially in names. If possible, leave it to the user to determine how his name is spelled. And do not punish for not following fictitious rules and restrictions (formatting fields, etc.). Format the form automatically if possible.\n\nClickable things must be obvious. Do not use the same color for links or buttons and non-clickable headings. Make the difference between visiting and unvisiting links visible.\n\nUse clear headings and subheadings to break down content into sections so that users can scan the content for information.\n\nDo not let headers float between two blocks of text, it should be closer to its block.\n\nKeep the paragraphs short. Shorten the texts by removing all insignificant words and sentences. Use a simple language.\n\nUse lists. Highlight keywords. This allows the eye to focus on the most important information.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t need a big picture on the main page. When people understand what the site is about, it annoys them with its size. Those who already know you don\u2019t need it.\n\nLight comes from the sky. Shadows are invaluable cues in telling the human brain what user interface elements we\u2019re looking at.\n\nBlack and white first. Designing in grayscale before adding color simplifies the most complex element of visual design and forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements.\n\nDouble your whitespace. To make UI that looks designed, add a lot of breathing room.\n\nUse only good fonts.\n\nConsider accessibility issues. In the current situation, a huge number of people who are not very familiar with computers have to use them in much larger volumes than before.\n\nAccessibility\n\nIncrease the text to 200% and check what your product looks like.\n\nCheck the contrast. Browsers know how to tell you that there is not enough contrast. You can also enable high contrast mode in the operating system.\n\nAdd alt attributes.\n\nUse the headers correctly. Do not jump over sizes.\n\nCheck labels for form fields.\n\nKeep track of the availability of content from the keyboard.\n\nYou can see more details here:\n\nArchitecture\n\nIf you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture. Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder\n\nDon\u2019t make complicated architecture in new projects, as it\u2019s not only long and expensive, but if your original idea and plans are not in demand, it\u2019s difficult to adjust the idea and change the product quickly.\n\nDevelop a language based on the domain model for programmers\u2019 communication with specialists.\n\nBreak the program into levels and isolate them from each other. Knowledge of the domain area should only be at one level. The GUI does not matter for business rules, so draw a line between them. The database does not matter for the GUI, so draw a boundary between them. Database is irrelevant for the business rules, so a boundary should be drawn between them.\n\nDatabase is not a data model. A database is a part of the software. A database is a utility that provides access to data. From the architectural point of view this utility does not matter, it is a low-level detail \u2014 a mechanism.\n\nUser interface is a detail. Web is a user interface. That is, the Web is a detail. And as an architect, place details like this outside of the core business logic.\n\nMake sure that there is low connectivity between modules, while within a module the connectivity can be higher than outside.\n\nIf during program development it turns out that the specialists do not understand some technical details from simplified schemes, or you do not understand the specialists\u2019 descriptions, this is a signal that you are likely to have knowledge gaps in the domain area. And the architecture will fail if no changes are made.\n\nGive suitable names to classes and methods. If you need to study its implementation to understand how an object works, then the sense of encapsulation is lost.\n\nTake inspiration from math. Enter mathematical operations for objects. It can improve architecture and bring beauty to the code.\n\nStick to minimalism.\n\nThe Kent Beck\u2019s strategy:\n\nFirst make it work. You\u2019ll be out of business if it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThen make it right. Organize the code so you and others can understand and develop it when you need to change or understand something.\n\nFinally, make it fast. Organize the code to achieve the desired performance.\n\nProject Work\n\nIf you\u2019re not worried, you need to worry. And if you\u2019re worried, you don\u2019t need to worry. Ray Dalio\n\nUse the metrics to track product development. It is important to find a balance in the number of metrics. There should not be a lot of them to make it cheap and fast, but enough to see the problems. 3\u20134 metrics may be enough. If your metric is close to 100%, it may be worth changing. But don\u2019t forget about communication, metrics are just numbers.\n\nKeep in mind, that in the absence of data, people respond differently than when they have useless data. When there are no specific data, the a priori probability is used correctly; when there are useless data, the a priori probability is ignored.\n\nIn case of problems, use the \u201c5 why\u201d technique to understand the reason. You should ask \u201cwhy\u201d by constantly going deeper into the problem to find the true cause. Determine who is responsible for the result. If the result is poor, is it because of a lack of skills of a person or errors in the action plan?\n\nYou can manage a project with cost, time, quality and scale. Everybody should see and understand these variables and their relationship for good decision-making. The best way to manage variables is through scale. So, stick to your budget and time plans, but sacrifice scale. Cut off half of the ideas, then look at the rest and do it again. The lighter you are, the easier it is for you to change.\n\nStart with small budgets \u2014 it focuses on the most important tasks, leads to ingenuity.\n\nTravel light, it allows you to adapt quickly. Try not to get attached to vendors, proprietary formats, rigidly fixed road maps.\n\nDo not solve non-existent problems. For each new task, try to find a way to implement it faster and cheaper. Keep it simple: tomorrow may never come or by the time it does, we will know the best way to solve the problem. Do not pay for flexibility that you do not need. YAGNI\n\nThink about hiring testers. The cost of testers is much lower than that of developers.\n\nLearn to say no to ideas. Consider the hidden cost of implementation.\n\nDon\u2019t limit people too much to processes, let them figure out how to solve the problem themselves. Let them make a mistake. You may even put cheap mistakes into the budget. It is important to analyze these mistakes so you do not repeat them too often. In most cases, people want to do a superb job, the manager is to help them do it. Mistakes are a natural part of the development process. Everyone has the right and responsibility to try to make sense of important things.\n\nAvoid settings, they have a price to pay.\n\nMove on with slight steps. Use an iterative process to improve the product. Test your solutions as soon as possible, do not copy until the final release. A prototype that doesn\u2019t meet all the conditions can already be useful, for testing it with specialists or other teams.\n\nLearn and make sure the team learns too. Although a person may eventually achieve a top level of skill in a certain field, challenges don\u2019t become easier for him or her: the Olympic athlete finds his sport to be every bit as challenging as the novice does. Don\u2019t expect your employees to define their own blind spots and compensate for them.\n\nPlay to win, not to lose. Don\u2019t cover up with paperwork and plans to tell after that, it\u2019s not your fault.\n\nTake responsibility for your actions.\n\nA 40-hour working week (\u00b15 hours) allows you to be efficient and focused. Avoid extra working hours for two consecutive weeks.\n\nRemember the balance of business and development. Everyone should be responsible for its own part and be available to the other side.\n\nPlan in detail only the current release or iteration. The longer you delay planning, the more data you have and the more accurate you can predict the next steps.\n\nTime is not a negative value, so time errors always accumulate on the right. This is asymmetry. That\u2019s why we often make mistakes with time when planning.\n\nUrgent issues are not more important than strategic ones. Sometimes less means more and we should often throw away unnecessary and insignificant information and focus on the key things. Remember the Pareto 20/80 principle.\n\nUrgency is one of the major reasons for our distorted perception of the world. When we are under the pressure of urgency, we make bad analytical decisions. You always have to look and measure the data.\n\nIssue log can be an excellent tool for the company: employees write down all the problems, the level of importance and responsibility. It helps to understand the reasons.\n\nPain + analysis = progress. Accept the stiffness that comes with the best motives.\n\nOne of the most important skills you need to develop is to ask for advice from people who are competent in areas where you are not strong.\n\nMaking assumptions and asking questions is not the same as criticizing, so do not take them that way.\n\nSimultaneously evaluate the rate of change, the level at which the goal is and the relationship between them. If the situation improves, but the rate of change is low, then in adequate time the goal will not be achieved.\n\nTo make effective decisions, it is enough to understand most things on a general level.\n\nPrioritize by assessing the importance of additional information in relation to the cost of postponing a decision.\n\nFirst, do what you must do and then do what you like. Don\u2019t get distracted by the bright trinkets and don\u2019t forget about the mechanism behind your daily tasks.\n\nThere may not be enough time for the insignificant things, but it\u2019s better than not having enough time for the important things. You can use the Eisenhower Matrix for prioritization by dividing tasks by urgency and importance.\n\nAny task should be evaluated according to the probability of its successful completion and the level of its priority.\n\nIf you organized a meeting, manage the discussion.\n\nIdentify areas of personal responsibility for collective decision making. An impersonal \u201cwe\u201d is an obvious cue that the person is trying to avoid recognizing a mistake.\n\nSet up a bug tracker. Try to fix bugs before writing a new code.\n\nOften you have to change the product, even if it already works well, to maintain user interest.\n\nRemember that the idea that the new code will be better than the previous one may be quite absurd. The old code was already used, it was tested, and many errors were fixed. Remember that you throw away the knowledge that was in the project. Consider the primary reasons you want to rewrite the code and other solutions:\n\nArchitectural problems \u2014 it can be solved by careful refactoring verified by the entire team.\n\nPerformance problems \u2014 often 1% of changes can give 99% increase.\n\nUgly code \u2014 it can be solved by accepting formatting standards, setting up auto-formatting, git-hooks, etc.\n\nWhen demonstrating your product, pixels are important, everyone will focus on the screen. Make it as beautiful as possible. But if you can display the unfinished parts in the interface so they look unfinished.\n\nIf you show a non-programmer a screen that looks 100% complete, he will think the whole product is almost ready.\n\nIf you show a non-programmer a screen that looks much worse than expected in the final version, he will think the whole product is much worse.\n\nCognitive biases and mental models\n\nThere are many cognitive biases as well as mental models. Many of them are described in Kahneman, Cialdini, etc. Knowing about their existence will help avoid some mistakes in decision making or improve product design. Below are just a few of those that I think are most relevant to the article.\n\nAvoid the conjunctive events bias. We often overestimate the likelihood of conjunctive events-occurrences that must happen in conjunction with one another. The probability of a series of conjunctive events happening is lower than the probability of any individual event. So, we risk seriously underestimating the time, money, and effort required to achieve our goals.\n\nSunk Cost Fallacy \u2014 the tendency of people to irrationally follow through on an activity that is not meeting their expectations because of the time and/or money they have already spent on it. The sunk cost fallacy explains why people finish movies they aren\u2019t enjoying, finish meals in restaurants even though they are full, hold on to investments that are underperforming and keep clothes in their closet that they\u2019ve never worn.\n\nFraming Effect \u2014 a cognitive bias, in which people react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented, as a loss or as a gain.\n\nCommunications\n\nDo not hide until the last management decisions from the team, even if they are unpleasant for them.\n\nDo not talk about the person anything that you didn\u2019t dare to tell him in face.\n\nManage discussions:\n\nDo not criticize during the speech and give everyone, for example, 2 minutes without interruption to speak.\n\nUse active listening.\n\nIdentify a place in the queue for each person to ask questions after the speech. So, they will know that they will have the opportunity to ask questions and focus on the discussion.\n\nLook for people who disagree with the proposals.\n\nInvolve the silent.\n\nHiring\n\nDo not hire or hire as late as possible. Evaluate whether you may not do something or reduce functionality.\n\nIf you are hiring, you would prefer a smaller number of more talented people than a larger number of mediocre ones. This will reduce communication costs.\n\nGroups of 3 to 5 people are the most effective in practice.\n\nAs Brooks\u2019 law says, adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.\n\nThink of an employee with what values, abilities and skills you\u2019re looking for. The order of words matters here.\n\nAssume that most people don\u2019t change.\n\nPrefer the generalists. Multi-task team members allow you to adapt more quickly to changing conditions.\n\nAll else being equal, choose a talented writer. These people usually think more clearly and communicate better.\n\nThink of your teams as a sports manager: no one has all skills necessary for success, but everyone must be better at something. So, analyze where you fail more often and strengthen yourself. If you recruit people with the same strengths and weaknesses as the leader, it is more likely to lead to a negative result. The diversity of experience among candidates increases the chances that they will bring fresh ideas to the project.\n\nLook for people who know how to get projects done.\n\nDuring the interview, the candidate must show that he can write code.\n\nPay attention to actions, not words. One indicator could be the presence of open-source projects. There may be other indicators:\n\nPassion for programming.\n\nInterest in new languages and technologies because it may show interest in the profession.\n\nSkills of working with low-level technologies.\n\nAn interview example:\n\nIntroduction. Your brief story about yourself, company, position. Here you can assure the candidate you care about the process of problem solving, not the actual answers.\n\nAsk open questions about his/her previous experience. Sometimes go deeper into details. You can ask them to describe some complicated things in simple words to determine how real the candidate understands. Pay attention to the passion with which candidates talk about their experiences.\n\nGive simple programming tasks. Here you should pay attention to the speed of task execution. It may be a good indicator of how a person will solve real tasks later.\n\nGo on to more complicated things.\n\nA section for questions from the candidate.\n\nDevelopment\n\nI\u2019m not a great programmer; I\u2019m just a good programmer with great habits. Kent Beck\n\nA codebase is a place where we live, and our goal is to make it livable for ourselves and for all the other people who live there. When we write code, our goal isn\u2019t to finish it and move on, our goal is to make it sustainable, livable for the team that inhabits it.\n\nYou can think of yourself as a software writer, not a software engineer. \u201cWriting\u201d is a much more suitable metaphor for what we do most of the time than \u201cengineering\u201d is. Writing is about clarity and presenting information in a clear-to-follow manner so that anybody can understand it.\n\nWrite tests and keep the code as simple as possible. This way, you can reduce the cost of changes, avoid over-engineering and focus on current problems. Tests give you instant feedback.\n\nIntroduce the practice of updating dependencies every N days. It can be once a week or a couple of days a month.\n\nSet up deployment processes so it happens painlessly for you. This will allow you to test the product and get feedback quickly. With negative feedback, you can easily roll back the changes.\n\nAutomate processes (recovery from failures, routine operations, etc.), as you are not the most reliable component of the system.\n\nSet up linters that will perform automatic code checks, auto-formatting. This will simplify the work of all team members. At the code review stage, this will allow you to focus on business logic rather than coding style. Besides, you can set up code analyzers and get code quality checks or warnings about unsafe code. You may take a look at lefthook and prettier (or any other similar tools to your taste) and, depending on the language, these tools:\n\nUse validators:\n\nRefactoring\n\nTests make refactoring much easier.\n\nMove in tiny steps and run the tests after each step.\n\nRefactoring can be done immediately before adding an extra feature. This allows you to understand the code and make it better.\n\nAlways try to leave the code behind better than it was before you. Don\u2019t make the code worse.\n\nDon\u2019t take too long to choose a name for a function/variable during refactoring. Choose the one that came to your mind and change it when you choose the best option.\n\nIn most cases, you may ignore performance during refactoring (for example, split one cycle into several). After refactoring, fix performance issues if they occur.\n\nRefactoring is your job. Do not ask permission for it, but ask for advice. This is how you do your job, as a professional.\n\nAlways make sure the tests fall when they should fall.\n\nSecurity\n\nPay attention to the storage of sensitive data in the repository. Do not store them open. Sometimes a framework can take care of this problem, for example [Ruby On Rails] (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#environmental-security) or [Phoenix] (https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment. html). Or you can choose a different approach, like [git-secret] (https://git-secret.io/).\n\nTake care of the basic security of your servers. For example, if you have a few servers, you can see the tips in this article My first 10 minutes on a server and discussing on ycombinator. Either you can automate server deployment and create/find recipes for your favorite system: ansible, chef or something else.\n\nCheck that you have considered the most common security errors. For example, you can go through the list owasp.org/www-project-top-ten and check that:\n\nYou have taken care of the absence of injections in your code: SQL, NoSQL, etc.\n\nMake sure that the authentication is not broken and works correctly.\n\nChecked that there are no sensitive data and API in the public domain.\n\nMade no mistakes in the security configuration, for example: changed the default passwords, correctly configured the firewall (especially relevant for those who use docker).\n\nTake care of XSS.\n\nConfigured dependency update processes in case of vulnerabilities appear in them. For example, github sends reports on dependency vulnerabilities for different languages. This point can also be mitigated if you have implemented the practice of periodically updating dependencies described above.\n\nSet up logging and monitoring of your systems\n\nConclusion\n\nThe key thing is to remember that projects and processes are different, so adapt the practices to your processes. You should not take the above as absolute truth. It is only an approach that allows you to miss fewer details, especially when interacting with things that you only occasionally encounter.\n\nReferences",

Thanks!\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nHave you ever experienced FOMO \u2014 the \u201cFear of Missing Out\u201d? It\u2019s a form of social anxiety that makes people scared they\u2019re being left out of exciting or interesting events. It\u2019s usually triggered by posts on social media, where it looks like the whole world is having fun without you. If you suffer from FOMO, you\u2019re not alone. A recent study found that 70% of millennials experience the fear of missing out regularly. And there\u2019s a powerful psychological principle behind why people experience FOMO \u2014 it\u2019s called Loss Aversion. First identified by Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahneman, Loss Aversion is a psychological principle that says people will go to great lengths to avoid losing. In fact, the psychological pain of losing is twice as powerful as the pleasure of winning. Join us as we explore the good and bad sides of Loss Aversion, and how to use it to create more engaging, persuasive, and effective customer experiences.\n\nEPISODE NOTES",

        "text": "The impact of COVID-19 \u2014 data visualization using Plotly and comparative analysis with SARS\n\nDerive interesting data insights on covid-19 and visualize the outbreak of coronavirus compared to SARS\n\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWith the rapid spread in the novel corona-virus across countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO)and several countries have published latest results on the impact of COVID-19 over the past few months.\n\nI have been going through many sources and articles to understand the fatality trend and I was excited to come across this data source and decided to see some visualization on the same. The aim here is to understand how visualization helps to derive informative insights from data sources.\n\nFor the visualization part, I am using Plotly. Plotly is a visualization tool available in python, and R which supports a number of interactive, high-quality graphs and is a great tool for data science beginners.\n\nData-set:\n\nThe data-set sources are accumulated, processed and latest updates are made available by \u201cJohns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)\u201d in their github page\n\nTerms of use: As stated by JHU CSSE in link. [Data to be used only for research purposes].\n\nDetails on the data set is as follows:\n\nDaily reports data\n\nThis csv file contains information on the affected countries [in blue] which helps to identify the virus spread, information on infected cases, number of deaths and recoveries across countries. The country co-ordinates are also provided for analysis.\n\n2. Time-series data\n\nA time series data which contains the counts on infected cases, deaths and recoveries across countries is also given. The time series data has individual files for each case and needs to be processed before visualization. The country co-ordinates are also provided for time series visualization on geo plots such as Choropleth Maps.\n\nCodes: All the codes for producing the following charts and the data set used can be found in the link provided below.\n\nImportant notes:\n\nData as of 3rd March has been used for the below analysis. Please refrain from using the data or insights derived from the analysis for medical guidance or use of the same in commerce. It is solely for learning purpose.\n\nThe same code template can be leveraged for various other data sources. I would encourage readers to try other charts as well in Plotly and to customize the codes according to application requirements.\n\nAnother important aspect of showing your key findings is to use only a set of charts that infer key insight from the data rather than showing too much charts with redundant information.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe global impact of COVID-19\n\n2. Descriptive analysis on infected, mortality and recovery rates\n\n3. Timeline analysis on spread of COVID-19 between [Jan \u2014 Mar]\n\n4. Impact of COVID-19 over SARS: a comparative analysis\n\nThe global impact of COVID-19\n\nTo understand the impact of the virus on a geographical landscape, I used the geographical scatter plot from Plotly. The code for this interactive plot is found in the shared link which will give a more clear interactive visualization.\n\nGlobal impact of COVID-19\n\nObservation:\n\nFrom the chart, we can see the disease has infected a larger number of people in China where the virus was first discovered Even though the infected region is large [in blue], we can observe that the number of deaths are considerably low and we can also see there has been a lot of recovered patients to this date\n\nDescriptive analysis on infected, mortality and recovery rates\n\nHere I have used various charts to show how information can be mined from data sources.\n\nNote: Since China has a higher rate of infected cases which is greater than 85% compared to other countries, it would be good to exclude China and see the numbers on other countries. This will be applied to all the following charts.\n\nConfirmed cases: Analysis using pie chart\n\nInfected cases across countries\n\nInfected cases (excluding Mainland China)\n\nMainland china has the highest number of affected cases compared to other regions. Next to China, South Korea, Italy and Iran show high number of infected patients.\n\n2. Reported number of deaths: Analysis using bar chart\n\nNumber of reported deaths across countries\n\nNumber of reported deaths [excluding Mainland China]\n\nFrom the graphs we can see even though South Korea has the highest number of confirmed cases compared to Italy and Iran, their mortality rate is far below in comparison. Now an analysis of recovery across province/state is shown below,\n\n3. Recovery rates: Analysis using tree maps\n\nThe recovery rate across countries gives a wider scope of how countries are mitigating the outbreak. Here, the different levels of hierarchy comes from the data set in order, \u201cworld\u201d,\u201dCountry\u201d followed by \u201dProvince/Region\u201d as can be seen for Mainland China (\u201cworld\u201d,\u201dMainland China\u201d, [\u201cHubei\u201d, \u201cHenan\u201d,\u201dAnhui\u201d,,etc\u2026]).\n\nTree-map: Recovery rates\n\nTree-map: Recovery rates [excluding China]\n\nAn interesting point here is, Iran and Italy have higher number of recoveries compared to South Korea. From here, a deep dive into impact of other attributes (age, ethnicity and region) for recovery/death could give more clarity on these numbers.\n\nTimeline analysis on spread of COVID-19 between [Jan \u2014 Mar]\n\nIt is crucial to show how rapidly the virus has spread in different countries in a short span of time. Time line analysis would require some pre-processing on the original data to be visualized in Plotly which is provided in the notebook.\n\nHere I have only shown the trend for infected cases. A similar trend can also be observed for deaths and recoveries across countries. A consolidated view is given using line chart below.\n\nTimeline analysis across countries: Scatter plot\n\nTimeline analysis across countries\n\nTimeline analysis across countries [excluding China]\n\nObservation:\n\nWhile a steady growth in the virus spread can be observed in China, a rapid increase in number of cases within the past few days can be seen in some other countries.\n\nTimeline analysis: Multiple line chart\n\nOverall affected cases, deaths and recoveries in the world.\n\nImpact of COVID-19 vs SARS: a comparative analysis\n\nThe most intriguing part is to compare the impact of COVID-19 to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which is similar in nature. The dataset for SARS was obtained from kaggle data source. The data only contained overall infected and mortality cases and thus visualizing the same here. I have analysed the impact of both viruses in a window frame staring from its discovery to its impact in the next three months.\n\nTimeline analysis for infected cases:\n\nReported infected cases across the world: COVID-19 vs SARS\n\nTimeline analysis for reported deaths:\n\nReported deaths across the world: COVID-19 vs SARS\n\nObservation:\n\nEvidently COVID-19 is spreading faster and has a higher mortality rate compared to SARS. The advancements in transport could be a key factor in this case.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis article gives a detail analysis on how COVID-19 has impacted the world and how the derived insights can be used for downstream analysis. The charts can also be applied to other scenarios to infer key data insights.\n\nCodes: link to codes and data sets\n\nFuture work:\n\nTo learn more about other attributes such as patient gender, ethnicity and age and how it causes the fatality rate A dashboard of interactive charts to provide an overall summary\n\nReferences:",

        "title": "A.I. \u201cDoomsday\u201d Might Look Different Than We Think",
        "text": "Though distinct from Terminator-style \u201cdoomsday\u201d, our technologies have already profoundly changed the way the world works. | Source\n\nWe all have some sort of image of what the world could look like if robots take over. Hollywood has impregnated our imaginations with visions of metallic killers who seek only to advance their cause by using humanity as a means to their ends. Perhaps the robots don\u2019t even exterminate all of humanity, but simply farm their vital energy in order to power their society; weaving an intricate simulation to keep the humans distracted. These kinds of fears have reemerged in recent years due to advancements in, and popularization of, artificial intelligence technologies. When the mind of the people is stoked by the inflammatory influence of sensationalist media, nightmares run amok. We\u2019re beginning to live in a world pervaded by such nightmares.\n\nExperts have been pushing back recently: telling the worried masses that artificial intelligence is a long way from experiencing any sort of apocalyptic tipping-point. Rather, they emphasize that these types of doomsday scenarios are completely unrealistic. Even by the time A.I. is sufficiently advanced, they claim, we will have carefully planned for a host of worst-case scenarios; ultimately circumventing the problem before it comes to fruition. Worrying about robots taking over is more akin to those in the middle of the 20th century, imagining that nuclear wasteland-grown monsters would terrorize gentle humans with their glowing, melty third-arms.\n\nI would like to argue that A.I., despite what some experts are saying, does have the potential to bring about irreversible doomsday scenarios, has been doing so already, and is following in the footsteps of other powerful technologies. The transition from \u201cnormal\u201d life to a life where we are the puppets of digital systems will be so gradual, so subtle, that we will likely be taken along for the ride; none the wiser. To illustrate this argument, we should take a look at three technologies: car rental systems, social media, and nuclear weapons. Each offers both a portal into a future where humanity has no clue that it is ruled by artificial intelligence and a reflection of our own world that may reveal it to look more similar to a future doomsday than anyone thought.\n\nCar Rental Systems\n\nI recently had an experience during which I had to rent a car for a business trip. It seemed like a fairly straightforward transaction: I purchased the rental online in advance of my trip, paid for it in full so it was cheaper, and then showed up to pick up the rental car. Little did I know that the location I specified for pickup was not an actual rental office. Although it was listed in the choice of options and was the exact destination of my train, the office actually existed slightly down the road under a different name.\n\nThis completely threw off my rental, and I was forced to wait over an hour and a half to work with the employee at the rental office, his manager, and a customer service representative in a call center, while my case was being fixed. They were all supremely helpful, and I truly felt worse for them, seeing their frustration with the computer system, than I felt frustrated for having to wait so long. If this had occurred in the days preceding computer systems, the location difference would likely have been quickly corrected, acknowledged as a strange accident, and I would have received my keys and been on my way. Instead, in a world governed by digital bureaucracy, the rules of the rental office software were so strict that such a slight mistake (which it allowed for in the first place!) necessitated the involvement of three different employees whose expertise with the system was confounded. It begs the joke question: how many people does it take to screw in a light bulb? Well, obviously at least four if the light bulb is part of a national, computerized, strictly rule enforced light bulb screwing system with error messages that only serve to confuse those who are just trying to get some light in the room.\n\nWe are already living in a world where we are controlled in a significant way by computers.\n\nAnyone who has ever worked with computerized systems at the doctor, for medical insurance, or for any other large, national company who is anything other than a top notch in their software design, knows that these issues happen all the time. In many cases, the convenience promised by digital systems is mired in poor design; thus rendering the systems almost impossible to use given any edge cases.\n\nMy experience at the car rental office says a lot more about our society than simply that we occasionally design bad software. We can go so far as to say that because these types of issues arise all the time, they have become incredibly normalized to us. Over time, we had to accept the fact that computer systems often fail, and that sometimes we just have to spend hours trying to untangle issues that never would have arisen in a world devoid of strict software.\n\nWe are already living in a world where we are controlled in a significant way by computers. The employees helping me out were completely subjugated to the will of the stubborn rental system. Human ingenuity and power were rendered meaningless because the computer system held all the keys to unlocking my car rental. Because the world gradually started implementing digital, bureaucratic systems, everyone simply went along for the ride. In most cases, a low-level employee would never have any say as to whether or not their employer forces a broken, complex system on their job. A few people change the way the world works, and we are all forced to slowly accept that this is our new reality.\n\nDifferent technologies affect us in different ways. Whereas the car rental issue is frustrating, when other technologies exhibit flaws in their design, the outcomes can be much more pernicious. To examine the effects of, and response to, wide-scale implementation of machine learning systems, we need to look no further than the paragon of frustrating technology: social media.\n\nSocial Media\n\nFacebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat have all been embroiled in scandals in the past few years; garnering criticism from many diverse groups of people. Social media platforms transformed from being simply networks to connect old friends or classmates, to daily hubs for news and politics. Unfortunately, due to the nature of these systems being primarily financially motivated, profiting by advertising revenue calculated by the number of eyes that see ads on the site, social media networks also knowingly transformed themselves into addictive systems. By giving users content that they would inherently enjoy, playing into their existing biases, unsavvy social media users experience ideological isolation and augmentation by nature of only seeing news or opinions that agree with their own.\n\nThis type of machine learning, which is aimed at learning user behavior in order to bring them to an app or website to maximize profit, has had a profound effect on our society. It is commonplace now to recognize that overuse of social media can be very dangerous. People become addicted to Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, and are constantly surrounded by information that could be entirely distinct from that of someone with different preferences. It has led to many users adopting radically different worldviews from those of their political or ideological opposites and thinking them totally based in \u201cfacts\u201d they read on the internet. A.I. technologies employed via social media have affected so many individual viewpoints that societal discourse as a whole has profoundly shifted as a result.\n\nWhen only a handful of individuals make enormous decisions like these, wide-scale societal effects are heavily influenced by their perspectives \u2014 or lack thereof.\n\nAs in the case of the bureaucratic car rental system, people who use social media simply became acclimated to the fact that social media sites were harvesting their data and distorting their worldviews. At least with bureaucratic systems, their bugs and poor software design sometimes reveal their flaws and makes it clear that digital systems have an unfortunate and frustrating grip on our lives. Social media, and machine learning recommendation systems in general are designed with a flawed outcome in mind. When they work correctly, they are having a negative societal impact.\n\nWhen people think of A.I. doomsday robots controlling our lives, the picture of social media systems being those same doomsday robots never crops up. Of course, we are not brutally subjugated against our will, but to a degree, we are heavily restricted by systems that govern our lives like social media. If something informs your worldview, your worldview then controls actions you take based on your beliefs. When A.I. researchers dismiss the fear of systems taking more control of our lives than we want, I believe that they are missing this context. Often, computer scientists and software engineers are too isolated in the world of computing to recognize that deep social change is made by their technologies all the time.\n\nWide-scale normalization of incredibly destructive technologies is not new to humanity. In most recent memory, world-ending nuclear militarization has become almost commonplace to accept as the \u201cway things are.\u201d Where more voices used to speak up against proliferation of this destructive capability, the world has moved past the initial shock of such notions \u2014 even though the threat posed by the technology is arguably more significant today.\n\nNuclear Technology\n\nTechnologies that are initially shocking due to their potentially destructive capabilities can too easily become normalized when the conversation surrounding them is lacking. Our post-Cold War world cares less about the spread of world-ending nuclear weapons and the destruction of nuclear treaties than it did only a generation or two ago. The public conversations surrounding nuclear proliferation have all but stopped; assuming an inevitable, nuclear world. The truth is that proliferation of nuclear weapons is absolutely not an inevitability; as some world leaders or technicians may suggest. Inventors, innovators, and state leaders have the ability to choose how technology progresses based on their ideologies and goals. A U.S. president who drives towards military hegemony will be more likely to rip up nuclear arms treaties than a president who wishes technology to be used for more humanitarian purposes. The only reason the dissemination of these weapons is considered \u201cthe way things are\u201d is because so-called leaders have actively pushed for it to be the way things are; motivated by profits, power, or perhaps ignorance tinged with madness.\n\nArtificial intelligence will likely follow a similar path. Due to its incredibly powerful nature, decisions restricting or liberating its potential uses, or of where to integrate it into society, will surely initially fall on the shoulders of political and industry leaders. When only a handful of individuals make enormous decisions like these, wide-scale societal effects are heavily influenced by their perspectives \u2014 or lack thereof. After a phase of initial public scrutiny of such decisions, there is a great risk of important discourse fading away; leaving only a few to deliberate the fates of many.\n\nRecognizing the potential for gradual \u201cdoomsday\u201d to occur, and voicing our concerns in a loud way, is the best way right now to ensure accountability of powerful technology actors.\n\nWe should view A.I. as a technology whose power is of the same magnitude as nuclear weapons. While the effects of these systems may not be as immediately shocking as the use of a nuclear weapon, it stands to reason that long-term societal effects from the use of A.I. systems can be as far reaching as the multi-generational aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We cannot allow the world to become so acclimated to the manipulations of A.I. that only a few have any say or opinion about its effects in the world. People who stand to be most affected by results of these systems should have a permanent say in how they are developed and used. Discourse should be constantly encouraged; even \u2014 and especially \u2014 when it gets in the way of short-term profits or power gains.\n\nJust as the world is a simple mistake away from a doomsday scenario driven by nuclear catastrophe, a not-too-distant future world may also have the added threat of subtle, societal doomsday driven by an undiagnosable digital flaw, or the unknown mistake of a handful of programmers. Those who make decisions regarding both of these technologies are consciously making choices that shape the entirety of human society. Any malintent, bias, or ignorance on the part of those in control could certainly bring about the doomsday that experts say is essentially impossible. It is very dangerous that the same experts are becoming part of the normalization process. This should be constantly countered by an equally powerful, and diverse, set of voices calling for caution. If the balance ever swayed too far toward normalization, it could mean complete control by a handful of unaccountable, potentially malicious, few.\n\nAccountability May Mean Life or Death\n\nA threat that is perpetuated by the potential ignorance or mistakes of the few has only one logical counterpart: mitigation by the many. Technologists do not like to talk about this because they often become too wrapped up in their own expertise to consider the opinions of those whose lives are most affected by their potential failings. They understandably imagine that any ordinary person would have such an ignorant opinion regarding decisions made about A.I. that they believe technologists alone have a mandate to shape the developments and usages of their systems.\n\nThis mindset is surely folly. The perspective of those whose lives are most changed by powerful technologies is essential to render any conversation even-sided. Nuclear proliferators surely would have a different opinion about the technology if their home had been utterly annihilated by a nuclear weapon. Executives at Facebook would likely have different thoughts about the effects of their greedy recommendation systems if they had found themselves unknowingly manipulated by the algorithms. Those who have the privilege of standing outside of the blast zone of these technologies often lack the perspective or empathy to imagine the disastrous effects applying to them. A.I. experts who dismiss domination by computer systems are right to dispel Terminator-fueled hysteria, but wrong to so completely dismiss the notion that our societies really could be controlled by computers without the requisite human understanding to turn back.\n\nThose who design artificial intelligence and machine learning systems must plan for enough degrees of control that any potentially disastrous effects could be easily mitigated. They must also commit to taking the view of the \u201ccommon person\u201d into account when making significant decisions. Just as the scandals surrounding Facebook and Twitter\u2019s use for political manipulation sparked public outrage, the only existing avenue to try to change how these systems affect your life is to become outraged.\n\nDue to the lack of popular representation in corporations who control much of the world, and the unwillingness of governments to regulate A.I., right now the burden of accountability falls on ordinary people. Recognizing the potential for gradual \u201cdoomsday\u201d to occur, and voicing our concerns in a loud way, is the best way right now to ensure the accountability of powerful technology actors. If technologists or potential regulators do not listen to the concerns of the many, due to ignorance or arrogance, their choices could mean life or death for many around the world.\n\nTo view machine learning technologies in anything other than this light is to look the other way in the face of deep troubles plaguing the world. Sure, machine learning or artificial intelligence will probably not create killer robots hellbent on controlling us through a sophisticated simulation. However, if we\u2019re not careful in our analysis of these systems, we may wake up in a world where our lives are dominated by machines that were created by a few, cannot be easily rolled back, and where we may not even know how much we\u2019re being controlled until it\u2019s too late.",

We\u2019d love to have you. Fill out this form for an invite!\n\nDear Better Marketing readers and writers,\n\nCreative, talented people with expertise in marketing are everywhere, but sometimes that community can be hard to access \u2014 especially if you work in a smaller organization or a more entrepreneurial endeavor, where you might not have a full marketing team to bounce ideas around with. I\u2019m drawing from personal experience here: I literally run a publication for marketers, but if I wanted some advice from folks who are really good at email marketing about how to make my newsletter better, I don\u2019t have a go-to place to find that.\n\nAnd if something doesn\u2019t exist, why not make it yourself? So, we\u2019re launching a Better Marketing Slack community.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve been writing for Better Marketing since we launched, or you\u2019ve just stumbled upon our publication. Maybe you\u2019ve been in marketing for decades, or you don\u2019t work in marketing at all and want to learn something new. Maybe you have new projects you\u2019re excited to share and collaborate on, or you\u2019re feeling stuck and looking for a way to re-ignite your creative energy. Wherever you are, come join us on Slack!\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a \u201cmarketer\u201d to join \u2014 if you work in writing, brand strategy, design, communications, digital storytelling, journalism, or other creative industries, you\u2019ll fit right in. Lifetime access to our Slack community is $10 USD (and free for all Better Marketing writers).\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what this will look like, but we have some ideas that we\u2019re excited about. Here\u2019s a few: writer AMAs; virtual talks or workshops on creative topics; something like pair programming sessions, but for marketing projects; job postings and marketing gigs; writing accountability clubs; peer edits and feedback circles for articles; random virtual coffee dates?\n\nI\u2019ve been lucky enough to be a part of different creative communities, and I am stoked to take what I\u2019ve learned and to try out new things with this one.\n\nJoin us! Here\u2019s how:\n\nRead the Better Marketing Slack Community guidelines below, and then Fill out this form for an invitation.\n\nWe hope to see you there!

        "title": "1 Popular Writing Tip I Completely Ignore Every Time",
        "text": "Why I Think \u201cTarget Audience\u201d Doesn\u2019t Always Matter So Much\n\nFirst, writing isn\u2019t a science.\n\nWhen you write a good story, almost anybody will read it. I really believe that. I think worrying about a \u201ctarget audience\u201d can make you too preoccupied with things that don\u2019t matter. You need to be thinking about emotion.\n\nEmotion plays no matter what audience you\u2019re writing for.\n\nSecond, the term \u201ctarget audience\u201d puts you in a box. If you say you\u2019re going to write blog posts for freelancers in their 20\u2019s, then every single blog post, to you, better be for freelancers in their 20's.\n\nWhat if you want to write about a relationship you once had, though?\n\nYou can\u2019t. You got to write to freelancers in their 20\u2019s. It gives you no freedom to dabble, and that can get really draining as a writer.\n\nThird, most folks only have three or four topics they really want to write about anyway. For me that\u2019s travel, writing, life lessons, and relationships. These are my four topics. You\u2019ll never read a cooking article from me. I don\u2019t care about that.\n\nIf you free yourself from boundaries as a writer, you\u2019ll arrive at your target audience organically. Who is my target audience? People like me, I suppose!\n\nFourth, too much emphasis on \u201ctarget audience\u201d can dehumanize you to your audience. What makes Shannon Ashley so endearing for me is the fact that she writes such personal sh*t.\n\nThat humanizes her. That makes me want to read her more, no matter what she decides to focus on, because I love her and want to support her.\n\nIf I just gave you more freelancing tips every blog post, that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m not anything more than a teacher to my audience. By writing more personal stuff, I become something much more. I become not only helpful, but relatable. I become less of a teacher and more of a friend.\n\nAnd who do you want to hang out with more? Your teacher or your friend?",

        "title": "I Work in a Nursing Home on Lockdown. There Is So Much Loneliness Here.",
        "text": "I Work in a Nursing Home on Lockdown. There Is So Much Loneliness Here.\n\nHow the coronavirus is affecting the day-to-day life of my residents \u2014 and my own mental health\n\nA resident at the Leonard Florence Center for Living in Boston. Photo: Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAfter the first case of the coronavirus was reported in our state of New York, day-to-day life at the nursing home where I work seemed to change overnight. As the medical director of our facility told the administrators, it\u2019s not a matter of if the virus hits our area \u2014 but when.\n\nThe elderly residents I work with are among the most at-risk groups for a global pandemic that\u2019s spreading faster than we can keep up. Many are now anxious for anything to occupy their time after state officials ruled that everyone except staff and medical personnel would be banned from entering the facility. Extreme circumstances warrant an exception, of course. But many of the 144 residents under our care are growing lonely and bored without their families.\n\n\u201cAre we going to have a movie this afternoon? Something, anything?\u201d one resident asked me as I walked by him the other day. He\u2019s been missing his son and their regular Dunkin\u2019 coffee and football game time.\n\nThere wouldn\u2019t be a movie playing that afternoon because the nursing staff needed the TV for a training session on how to deal with the coronavirus. Nursing homes and long-term care facilities have been under lockdown since the Covid-19 outbreak, which has seen a dramatic mortality rate among the elderly and chronically ill. In Washington state, as many as 35 coronavirus deaths have been linked back to a single nursing home.\n\nI primarily work in the activities department, where we are in charge of the day-to-day entertainment for our residents. We are involved with everything from cooking to putting on monthly birthday parties, luncheons with our volunteers, casino outings, and, of course, their favorites: bingo and live music. I hated to tell my resident that afternoon that not only was the previously scheduled music session now canceled, but his movie was as well. The most important thing is that first and foremost my residents are safe and currently healthy. But oh, are they lonely.\n\nThey miss their families. They miss the volunteers and the live music. They miss the priests, and the kind elderly man who comes in to say the rosary and buys candy bars for bingo prizes every week before he leaves. One of my favorite residents has dementia and is clearly missing her daughter, who would come to the nursing home twice a day to spend time with her and assist with her meals.\n\nAll three sections of the nursing home have been separated completely, and many of my residents are not only feeling the absence of their families, but their friends as well. We\u2019re proud of the sense of community we have built here, and we\u2019re doing our best to preserve that, but all of us have felt the effects of these changes. Not only are activities now separated, but so are the dining tables in order to keep as many of them as possible six feet apart. Smiling familiar faces and voices are now hidden and muffled behind masks at all times. While the residents know it is for their safety, my heart can\u2019t help but sympathize with the occasional resistance from those who wish they had more control over their circumstances.\n\nAs much as it\u2019s affecting the day-to-day lives of my residents, I have to admit I\u2019ve begun to notice it\u2019s affecting my mental health as well.\n\nIt\u2019s painful to know that my region is unprepared and ill-equipped to handle an outbreak.\n\nOftentimes, I am separated from co-workers who have become my family and help me get through the stresses of the day. I genuinely was not at all prepared to feel so distant from them, or to not always have them to fall back on and talk to when the day is getting a little too stressful. We are spread thin throughout the entire building, only seeing each other for brief 10-minute periods a couple of times a day unless we are specifically scheduled together for an activity that they know will require more help.\n\nIt becomes harder and harder to stay upbeat when your resident says she is going to postpone her chemo treatments because of the coronavirus; it gets even worse when you see news flash across her TV screen that a man on the nearby military base has tested positive. It\u2019s not easy to act like I\u2019m staying positive when I drive through the Main Street of my little town that\u2019s become a ghost of what it was just a month before, wondering how all these little businesses are going to get through this.\n\nUp until now, I never truly understood how much just scrolling through a social media feed is able to dictate my entire mood and outlook for the rest of the day. There have been more than a couple nights recently where I\u2019ve curled up in the corner of my couch, not even motivated enough to turn a light on while I struggle to take in everything that\u2019s happened just in the past 24 hours before I go to bed. I feel the profound sense of exhausted numbness that gets harder and harder to shake. At this point, I am drained in nearly every conceivable way.\n\nIt\u2019s painful to know that my region is both unprepared and ill-equipped to handle an outbreak. Every day going in to work, I am fully aware of the danger that this threat poses not so much to me as a young, healthy 25-year-old, but to the residents who I am trusted to care for. While I am all but guaranteed to make a full recovery if I get this sickness, that may not be the case for many of my residents. The burden is heavy, and the road ahead appears long. All I can do is attempt to hold my head high for my residents who need me more than ever, and stay healthy so they will.",

Given today\u2019s abundant wealth and advanced technologies, we need not have any hunger, pollution, energy needs, traffic deaths, political inefficiency, terrorism, or wars. If we better distributed and deployed the innovations and resources we have right now, these would all be things of the past. We\u2019ve mapped the human genome and are manipulating DNA, we\u2019re learning more ways to deploy nanotechnology, and we could colonize the moon, and probably Mars in five years if we had the will.

        "text": "Photo by Gemma Evans on Unsplash\n\nI used to cope fairly well with rejection, as it seemed part of the process of becoming a writer. But fifteen years into trying very seriously to learn the craft, an MFA, and multiple publications later, I\u2019m finding rejection harder and harder to deal with. It\u2019s hard because each piece is a regarded as a brand-new offering to the world no matter how much experience I have; it\u2019s hard because my identity is even more wrapped up in my success as a writer than it ever was because I\u2019ve been doing it so long; it\u2019s hard because I\u2019ve had some success, but my main goal is still out of reach; and it\u2019s hard because in writing it turns out there\u2019s no such thing as an expert, only older students. Slowly, I\u2019m re-learning that the success of the work is truly a separate thing from my creative practice, and that dealing with rejection is a matter of re-centering my values around my creative practice rather than the success of the work.\n\nSo here are some thoughts I\u2019m hoping I can come back to in those moments I feel despairing, and I hope they help some other people along the way, too.\n\nMy art is not actually me\n\nYes, it\u2019s an expression of me.

I write because I am always changing, always learning, and have new things to say and express, but my work is not even just a piece of me. It\u2019s something I made to represent that piece of me. My work is not me, and other people\u2019s rejection of my work is not a rejection of me as a person. And even if it was, not every other person is going to like me. That\u2019s impossible, and, frankly, unwanted. Who wants to be so palatable that literally everyone likes them, like water? I\u2019d be bland and invisible.\n\nAll a rejection is telling me is that this piece is not going to be published at this particular time with this particular publishing company. That\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not good. It doesn\u2019t even mean the editor didn\u2019t like it. I had one piece get rejected and then, years later, the (now former) editor e-mailed me out of nowhere saying he had never stopped thinking about it, here was a potential edit, and I should resubmit it to the magazine and the new editor. So I did that, and they took it. That circumstance let me get some time and distance from the story so that I could be more open to edits, and it was honestly more amazing to hear that someone had thought about my work for that long than it would have been to have gotten it published right away.\n\nSo remember that sometimes a rejection opens the door for a better situation later. If the piece is already published, it (usually) can\u2019t get published somewhere else with more readers. A rejection might be the reason for success later.\n\nAnd if the piece is really rejected, like I have 100 rejection letters in my hand and it really is time to throw in the towel, then I learned something. I can either rewrite or work on something new. But it is not a judgment of my ability or me as a human being. It\u2019s just a judgment of that piece.\n\nPublishing is not writing\n\nGetting work accepted by a publisher or magazine is a matter of skill, but on top of that it\u2019s a matter of timing and the opinions of other people, neither of which I can control in the least. Judging the quality of my work by the outcomes of things I can\u2019t control is an exercise in stupidity, much like judging my worth as a human being based on where the leaf I threw into the water lands on the shore. (I don\u2019t know why all my metaphors are water metaphors but here we are).\n\nOutput, however, I can control. Deliberate practice is something I can control. I want to measure my success by whether I produce, by my own judgment of what I produce, and whether or not I am deliberately pushing myself to overcome my personal weaknesses. One of my weaknesses is plot. So my metrics have become: did I write today? Did I analyze the plot of something I read or watched this week? Am I improving at my ability to create the plot bones of my work to hang my characters on?\n\nI need to keep my eye on what I can control, and measure my abilities by that. Not by whether the twenty-something intern at a publishing house fell asleep trying to read my memoir on the E train. (For all I know, she stayed up way too late last night and hates memoir and it has nothing to do with my work).\n\nDon\u2019t submit until there\u2019s a new work going\n\nThe same way Hemingway advised writers to stop work for the day only when they know what they\u2019re going to write tomorrow, I\u2019ve begun to submit my finished pieces for publishing only when I\u2019ve started a new piece. It eases my disappointment and anxiety about rejections of the old work to have a new work to be invested in, and then I\u2019m still meeting output goals for myself. Basically, it\u2019s a way to mitigate rejection and keep moving forward.\n\nJudge publishing success by personal effort, not outcomes\n\nThis year I made it my goal to get 100 rejections. (I got this idea from my friend Melissa Goodrich who is a fantastic writer and has two books out, go read her stuff). Really, this is a goal of 100 submissions, but it incorporates rejection into the fabric of the idea so that you\u2019re not secretly hoping for 100 acceptances.\n\nBut the key to why I think Goodrich\u2019s method is a good one is that it\u2019s a goal whose metric is the writer\u2019s effort, rather than the subjective decision of an editor or the timing within a zeitgeist. Aiming for 100 rejections means deliberately submitting, accepting rejection as a likely outcome, and committing to doing it long-term. It puts meeting the goal in the writer\u2019s hands and measures success by effort rather than outcomes. And measuring success by one\u2019s own efforts means that success is always possible, and it makes a writer so, so much less likely to give up.",

        "title": "3 Taboos You Must Integrate in Order to Sell Yourself Effectively",
        "text": "There\u2019s no way around it: selling is sleazy.\n\nIt immediately invokes power dynamics with unsavory images. Hunters stalking prey. Greasy, pressure-y men with bad teeth and bad breath, cornering you in a tacky office full of stale air. Malignant advertising think-tanks, plotting to perfectly twang on the heartstrings and manipulate your impulses.\n\nYes, selling is seen as so evil that the Devil Himself is a salesman, always looking to get the better end of the bargain.\n\nSelling is sleazy because it requires confronting some pervasive social taboos. To sell well, you have to be willing to do things that most people find uncomfortable. You must:\n\nface your animal nature;\n\nclearly ask for what you want; and,\n\nwithhold what you have from those who want it until they meet your demands.\n\nConfronting the need to sell is of absolute importance when stepping into the world of entrepreneurship, business, or any self-supporting endeavor. And yet, the Salesperson archetype is one of the most challenging: the urge to turn away from it and avoid it is strong.\n\nSo \u2014 what\u2019s a hungry girl to do?\n\nLet's confront the taboo realities of selling to shed some light on this shadowy, dimly-lit, hush-hush territory.\n\nYou Must Eat.\n\n\u201cNever get so attached to a poem you forget truth that lacks lyricism. Never draw so close to the heat that you forget that you must eat.\u201d \u2014 Joanna Newsom\n\nLet us begin by remembering the most terrible of facts: we are all animals. We are animals who must eat \u2014 and therefore destroy \u2014 other life-forms.\n\nMuch as we would like to avoid this fact, and are helped in this avoidance by modern civilization\u2019s extreme phobia of animal-ness, it remains true and incontrovertible.\n\nLet that sink in:\n\nIn order for you to continue to live, you must DAILY consume the life-force of other beings.\n\nSo very many of us are focused on the good we wish to do in the world \u2014 the poetic truths we hold dear, the ideals we champion \u2014 and so hyper-aware of the harm and greed caused daily on our behalf, that it is tempting to disassociate from the reality of yourself as a primal animal, in need of animal sustenances.\n\nDon\u2019t do that.\n\nStay with me.\n\nWe need to stay present with ourselves as animals-who-need-to-be-fed for two reasons:\n\nIf we forget this ourselves, we are liable to give overly-much without ensuring our own nourishment in the process. If we allow others to dull us into unawareness, we become dependent on others and easily frightened by our own bodies, and \u2014 interestingly \u2014 that much more susceptible to the sleaziest of sales tactics.\n\nSo \u2014 remember. You must eat.\n\nWe can be grateful that we are sheltered from the bloodiest truths of our animal nature by the clean and slick medium of money \u2014 and yet, we must never forget that we sell in order to live.\n\nLike a lean mama wolf out on a cold clear night, her senses sharp and alert, we bring home rabbits in order to keep the flame of life alive in ourselves and those we love.\n\nYou Must Ask.\n\nSo much of what we despise in the salesperson archetype is their bold willingness to ask for what they want.\n\nClear, concise communications of desire are, in many ways, taboo in our culture.\n\nWe are more used to manipulation, passive aggression, and indirect requests.\n\nMore to the point, we are often completely unsure of what we want. So unsure, that the thought of explicitly asking for it is unthinkable.\n\nWe feel frightened of salespeople because when we don\u2019t know what we want \u2014 when we are unsure of our own desire \u2014 the salesperson\u2019s desire, their offer, can feel like a manipulation or seductive irresistible stand-in for our own missing desire energy.\n\nThis has all kinds of sexual-archetypal implications and accounts for the greasy patina we often psychically feel around sales interactions.\n\nMost importantly, this discomfort with knowing our desire is the knot that must be unraveled in order to both sell effectively and be sold to without yucks.\n\nTo be an excellent salesperson, one must be able to ask with the confidence and respect of a lover fluent in the language of consent.\n\nClear requests and offers are made, objections are heard without reaction, negotiations are entered into until both parties are comfortable.\n\nThis is ideal. Open communication of desire between two people.\n\nVery sexy.\n\nYou Must Know Your Worth.\n\nThe final taboo that smears on layers of fetid trashy stink is a salesperson\u2019s willingness to represent their goods as valuable.\n\nHow audacious. So upsetting to narratives of smallness that many people have swallowed.\n\nEven more revolting, the salesperson withholds their excellent, desirable, much-needed product until they get what they want.\n\nThey violate the most basic kindergarten laws of kindness \u2014 they don\u2019t share, or bring enough for everyone (unless everyone can pay\u2026).\n\nAnd yet, given that the salesperson must eat \u2014 what other choice is there?\n\nThere will always be a tension of withholding until the score is settled.\n\nIt is here where the shadow of the buyer emerges most strongly in the archetype of the victim, or the beggar, or the down-on-his-luck, sure-could-use-a-hand type of guy who believes he deserves something for nothing.\n\nThe interplay between this beggar character (who secretly believes he deserves nothing) and the salesperson doesn\u2019t last long if the salesperson is experienced: they lose interest.\n\nHow can a salesperson sell to a person who believes they deserve nothing, and therefore desire nothing, and are willing to offer nothing of themselves?\n\nThe willingness to cut ties quickly with this type of situation, knowing that they have valuable things to offer, adds a calculating callousness to the greasy sleaze of the Salesperson Archetype.\n\nTo Win at Selling is to Reconcile the Taboo.\n\nIn order to sell effectively, you must find acceptance for these things in yourself.\n\nYou Must Eat : to ask a price, to exact payment, is embedded in the natural order. Don\u2019t feel bad about it, hide from it, or disguise it.\n\n: to ask a price, to exact payment, is embedded in the natural order. Don\u2019t feel bad about it, hide from it, or disguise it. You Must Ask : know what you want, know what you\u2019re offering, and know what you can and can\u2019t do to be flexible and close the deal. Clear communication is a blessing we need more of it.\n\n: know what you want, know what you\u2019re offering, and know what you can and can\u2019t do to be flexible and close the deal. Clear communication is a blessing we need more of it. You Must Know Your Worth: and own it. No one deserves to consume you without supporting you in return unless you decide to let them. Having boundaries is not taboo, it\u2019s hot.\n\nYou will know you have accepted these things in yourself when you encounter the Salesperson archetype in others, and instead of being skeezed out by the sleazy slime \u2014 you see a fellow artist of desire, working their magic.",

        "title": "Sleep-Deprived and Inactive People May Fare Badly Against Covid-19 (and Other Infections)",
        "text": "Sleep-Deprived and Inactive People May Fare Badly Against Covid-19 (and Other Infections)\n\nIt\u2019s not so often that such an obvious study is done.\n\nDesign vector created by freepik \u2014 www.freepik.com\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that healthy sleeping and exercise habits are important lifestyle factors that support the immune system and prevent diseases. It may be so obvious that coronavirus research thus far seldom considers confirming it. At least, I rarely see studies examining how lifestyle factors interact with Covid-19.\n\nOne such study was published last month in Nature and Science of Sleep, a reputable journal, titled \u201cReduced Sleep in the Week Prior to Diagnosis of COVID-19 is Associated with the Severity of COVID-19.\u201d The title alone is probably sufficient as a take-home message. But this piece will dissect the study further and provide more context.\n\nWhat the study did and found\n\nResearchers in China traced back health records of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 across multiple hospitals from three different China provinces. Then they called the patients to inquire about their personal information such as age, sex, weight, physical activity, and sleep. In sum, 164 people infected with Covid-19 (who were discharged from the hospital) and 188 uninfected responded.\n\nUsing both the health records and phone interview data, the study identified several independent risk factors of getting Covid-19 and severe Covid-19. (By independent, it means factors that are not influenced by other factors.) These include smoking history, medical comorbidities, irregular exercise, sedentary lifestyle, overexertion, and reduced sleep.\n\nSpecifically, those who did not exercise regularly (less than three times per week) had a 2.9-times increased risk of severe Covid-19. Interestingly, 91% of asymptomatic infections happened to those who exercised regularly, which means they didn\u2019t get sick despite contracting the coronavirus. Moderate intensity exercises provided the maximal benefit.\n\nEven animals intuitively sleep more when they are fighting infections. Sleep deprivation studies in humans or animals, in turn, always leads to worse health outcomes from, as well as increased risk of, infections.\n\nAbout sleep, 7\u20139 hours were defined as adequate. Notably, the sleep status was determined during the week before the Covid-19 diagnosis. Analyses revealed that the \u201crisk of severe infection increased with decreased sleep status, reaching [6.7-times] higher for potentially appropriate sleep and peaking at [8.6-times] higher for lack of sleep\u2026,\u201d the study authors wrote. Moreover, \u201cthe possibility of developing damage of external lung organs [as a result of Covid-19] decreased with increases in average daily sleep time.\u201d\n\nMore context on exercise\n\nA prior study in May 2020 utilizing the U.K. biobank data of 387,109 adults has also found physical inactivity as an independent risk factor for Covid-19 hospitalization\u2014 with a population attributable fraction (PAF) of 8.6%. This means 8.6% of Covid-19 hospitalizations could have been prevented if the factor was addressed. Fortunately, even less exercise (<150 minutes per week) also conferred benefits in lowering hospitalization risks. This study has also calculated the PAFs of other factors and how overall \u2018lifestyle score\u2019 affects hospitalization risks, as detailed here:\n\nMany other population studies \u2014 with sample sizes ranging from about 30,000 to 100,000 \u2014 have also supported regular exercise as a protective factor against risks of future infections, such as bloodstream infections (and sepsis), pneumonia, and overall bacterial- and viral-induced deaths.\n\nTo restate, moderate-intensity exercise was found to be the most beneficial in the study described above, compared to low-, high-, or no-intensity. Studies involving athletes also agree that moderate levels of physical activity are most optimal in attenuating the risks of respiratory infections.\n\nThis means 8.6% of Covid-19 hospitalizations could have been prevented if the factor was addressed. Fortunately, even less exercise (<150 minutes per week) also conferred benefits in lowering hospitalization risks.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that only one-fourth and one-fifth of American adults and high-schoolers, respectively, get enough exercise. Exercise is a primary protective factor against chronic diseases \u2014 e.g., diabetes, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, depression, anxiety, and others\u2014 which are \u201cthe major killers in the modern era.\u201d Advancing civilization has allowed \u201cmodern humans [to] engineer most physical activity out of daily life,\u201d Frank W. Booth, a nutrition and exercise physiology professor, and co-workers stated. \u201cHumans now have a choice not to be physically active.\u201d\n\nMore context on sleep\n\nIt\u2019s general advice to rest well to recover from infections, and that means more sleep. Even animals intuitively sleep more when they are fighting infections. Sleep deprivation studies in humans or animals, in turn, always leads to worse health outcomes from, as well as increased risk of, infections.\n\nFor example, in a study of 56,953 middle-aged nurses without major medical comorbidities, those who habitually sleep 5 hours or less or 9 hours or more were more likely to contract pneumonia. Similar findings were reported in another study of 22,726 American adults, where sleeping 5 hours or less doubled the risk of influenza, pneumonia, or an ear infection.\n\nAnother notable point is long-term sleep loss does the immune system more harm than short-term sleep loss. In fact, the latter might even enhance immunity, as shown in animal tests. \u201cEvolutionarily, this might be explained by the fact that the host defense system needs to be enhanced in a situation of acute total sleep loss (such as being hunted by a predator) but that without sleep, the immune system eventually fails,\u201d Nigel Curtis, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases, and co-workers stated.\n\nMore than one-third of American adults don\u2019t sleep enough. Shift work, pressured lifestyle, and other societal stressors may be to blame. \u201cBecause the immune system protects against both infection and [cancer], as well as enables immunization against disease, the concept that the behavior of modern society might compromise immunity has far-reaching public-health implications for both individuals and the population as a whole.\u201d\n\nShort abstract\n\nIt\u2019s common advice to exercise and sleep well, so the immune system can function as it should and ward off diseases. Indeed, a study in China has found that physical inactivity and sleep deprivation increase the risk of more severe Covid-19 by several folds. Similarly, a study in the U.K. has calculated that exercise could have prevented 8.6% of hospitalizations for Covid-19. These results are in line with many prior large, population-level studies showing that sufficient exercise and sleep prevent life-threatening infections. Yet, as a result of drastic societal changes, chronic sleep loss and lack of exercise have become the norm.",

I am going to use plasma. You can try different color palette such as \u2018viridis\u2019, \u2018plasma\u2019, \u2018inferno\u2019, \u2018magma\u2019, \u2018cividis\u2019. If you would like to use one color with different shades, you can pass \u2018Greys\u2019, \u2018Purples\u2019, \u2018Blues\u2019, \u2018Greens\u2019, \u2018Oranges\u2019, \u2018Reds\u2019 to palette parameter.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9,6))\n\nsns.barplot(x=\u2019Province_Code\u2019,y=\u2019Minimum_Wage\u2019,data=df,ci=95,ax=ax,\n\norder = df.sort_values(\u2018Minimum_Wage\u2019).Province_Code, palette = \u2018plasma\u2019)\n\nax.set_title(\u2018Minimum Wage Comparison across Canada\u2019)\n\nax.tick_params(labelsize=16,length=0)\n\nplt.box(False)\n\n3.5 Add grid lines\n\nAdding grid lines will help audience to pinpoint the height of each bar and have a better understanding of the numbers.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9,6))\n\nsns.barplot(x=\u2019Province_Code\u2019,y=\u2019Minimum_Wage\u2019,data=df,ci=95,ax=ax,\n\norder = df.sort_values(\u2018Minimum_Wage\u2019).Province_Code, palette = \u2018plasma\u2019)\n\nax.set_title(\u2018Minimum Wage Comparison across Canada\u2019) ax.tick_params(labelsize=16,length=0)\n\nplt.box(False)\n\n# add grid lines for y axis\n\nax.yaxis.grid(linewidth=0.5,color=\u2019black\u2019)\n\n# put the grid lines below bars\n\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\n\nBy default, the gridlines are solid lines. It can also be changed by pass variables to the parameter linestyle. You can check out more choices at the matplotlib page.\n\n3.6 Beautify title, labels and ticks\n\nIn this step, I am going to beautify the title by giving it a background color and changing the font size and font color. Also, I am going to change the ticks and axis labels.\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,8))\n\nsns.barplot(x=\u2019Province_Code\u2019,y=\u2019Minimum_Wage\u2019,data=df,ci=95,ax=ax,\n\norder = df.sort_values(\u2018Minimum_Wage\u2019).Province_Code, palette = \u2018plasma\u2019,alpha=0.8)\n\nax.set_title(\u2018Minimum Wage Comparison across Canada\u2019,backgroundcolor=\u2019#565656',\n\nfontsize=20, weight=\u2019bold\u2019,color=\u2019white\u2019,style=\u2019italic\u2019,loc=\u2019center\u2019,pad=30)\n\n\n\nax.tick_params(labelsize=16,length=0)\n\nplt.box(False)\n\nax.yaxis.grid(linewidth=0.5,color=\u2019grey\u2019,linestyle=\u2019-.\u2019)\n\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\u2018Province\u2019,weight=\u2019bold\u2019,size=15)\n\nax.set_ylabel(\u2018Minimum Wage\u2019,weight=\u2019bold\u2019,size=15) plt.yticks(np.arange(0, 18, 4)) #yticks starts from 0 and ends at 18, step is 4\n\nax.set_yticklabels([\u201c \u201c,\u201d$4\",\u201d$8\",\u2019$12',\u2019$16'],color=\u2019#565656')\n\nplt.xticks(rotation=30,color=\u2019#565656')\n\nplt.show()\n\nNow, you get a much more beautify bar chart.\n\nAt the very end, let us take a final look at the Before and After charts. The beautified chart is much more clear and and can help audience to read it more easily. Bars are in an ascending order. Labels and title are also informative. Grid lines is helpful in pinpointing the actual numbers of each bars.\n\nIf you are interested in making other types of beautiful charts, you may want to check out my other posts.",

        "text": "Have you had those few select moments or days where you realized your life took on a different path?\n\nMaybe when it happened \u2014 you couldn't see it, but now that the dust has settled, you know that that moment or those few hours were the pivot that would send you on a different life course.\n\nI know I've had my particular moment like that.\n\nIt was May of 2015.\n\nI had recently celebrated two years at the internet-based company I was working for. The celebration was felt with a somber note \u2014 at least internally for me. I didn't really care for what I was doing at the time. You see, I was a salesperson. I was calling auto dealerships and trying to sell our SaaS product to them.\n\nI knew I wasn't feeling fulfilled.\n\nI would show up at 9:06 am or 9:10 am because a few minutes being late didn't mean much\n\nI would open up my outlook calendar and roll my eyes at the pointless meetings I had with other teams (at least I thought they were pointless).\n\nI would make cups of coffee in the common area. The coffee was crap \u2014 I had no intention of even drinking it \u2014 I just wanted to get away from my desk for a minute or two.\n\nI would make fake calls to dealerships who I knew wouldn't pick up the phone \u2014 just so I could make my monthly call quota.\n\nI hated it.\n\nNear the end of that month, I was called into my boss's boss's office where I was put in front of a disciplinary tribunal.\n\nThey had me dead to rights.\n\nThey had printed out a quarter-inch stack of papers that tracked all of the fake calls I made.\n\nI was cornered.\n\nThey wanted to know what was up. They told me that if I signed a PIP plan (performance improvement plan) then after 30 days we could forget this ever happened and get back to \"normal.\"\n\nI'm no one's puppet.\n\nI flipped through the papers \u2014 trying to find extra time to come up with an excuse that would save my ass. I had nothing.\n\nI handed the packet back to them and said,\n\n\"I can't sign this \u2014 in 31 days we'll be having this same conversation again.\"\n\nNeedless to say \u2014 I was released from my position a few moments after that. They didn't even give me a two-week exit. I mean I got paid two weeks worth severance, but they wanted my toxic ass out the door.\n\nIn all attempts to not be clich\u00e9 \u2014 it was one of the most important moments of my life.\n\nIt made me realize that I couldn't work for at a job feeling unfulfilled, working for someone I didn't respect, and making wages I felt I was underpaid for.\n\nThat moment started the next 5-year journey that helped me get to the place I am now:\n\nI work for myself\n\nI write about and create things that bring me meaning\n\nI make a living I'm proud of\n\nIt all didn't come easy \u2014 in fact, there were days I wanted to pack everything up, curl into a ball cry and beg for my mommy. I'm not ashamed to admit that.\n\nWhat I'm going to write about is what I had to do in that journey in order to get where I am today. I want to share this story and offer these gifts of knowledge to anyone who understands these feelings and wants more for themselves.\n\nSo here goes\u2026",

For some it is a practical question: does reading this provide value to me? But for others the question is more fundamental: do I even belong here?\n\nSo who is Nightingale for? The easy answer is the dataviz community. But, in the 5 months since the launch of the Data Visualization Society and roughly 80 Medium stories later, a few things have become quite clear.\n\nThis community is expansive. We are designers who learned about data analysis and coding; we are scientists who learned about visual design and storytelling; we are computer programmers who learned about color theory and building visualizations. We all learned differently. Some of us have been doing this work for several decades \u2014 long before there were formalized programs \u2014 while others of us have never made visualizations professionally.\n\nAnd if the dataviz community is hard to summarize, summarizing our audience is an impossible challenge. The work we create is used across all fields, from public health, to history, to sports, to\u2026 Beyonc\u00e9. We have used our own hobbies to inform our visualizations, and incorporated visualization work into our most special days. We have used visualization as a tool to challenge the utility of everyday objects, and to measure small victories. Here at Nightingale we encourage people from all backgrounds to submit articles that continue to add new voices to this conversation.\n\nKnow someone who\u2019s unsure that Nightingale is for them? Share our homepage or one of the stories above and ask them to come explore.",

        "title": "Google, HuffPo, Greenpeace & the liberal progressive \u2018Resistance\u2019 are lying to you",
        "text": "Earlier in November, I got a press release about a new project launched by liberal media exemplar Huffington Post, in partnership with MIT\u2019s Presencing Institute, on \u201ctransforming capitalism\u201d. The project announced that HuffPo would provide a radical journalism hub exploring ways to redesign the economy, looking into concepts like \u201ccircular economy\u201d and other issues, while doing \u201conline to offline\u201d movement building to facilitate real action in relation to these solutions.\n\nIt sounded super-exciting.\n\nBut as I read on, I experienced a sinking feeling.\n\nThe new HuffPo-MIT project is headed up by Dr Otto Scharmer, senior lecturer at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management and co-founder of MIT\u2019s Presencing Institute. Dr. Scharmer is a management guru who has written extensively on theories and practice relating to organisational change and leadership.\n\nAnd despite some positives, Dr. Scharmer\u2019s grasp of the issues is confused, to say the least.\n\nSanitizing neoliberal deregulatory insanity\n\nScharmer rightly recognizes that there is a fundamental lack of joined up thinking in the approach to the multiple crises facing the planet. He calls for a more integrated response, and sets out his diagnosis of the problem in the destruction wrought by early phases of capitalism.\n\nHe commendably acknowledges the entrenched limits of conventional economic thinking, with its dependence on \u201ca very small number of economic theorists and frameworks.\u201d\n\nHe asks pointedly, \u201c\u2026 despite the millions of words devoted to [the economic crisis] by \u2018experts\u2019 on talk shows and in publications, what do we really know about its root causes?\u201d\n\nThis all sounds compelling, until his \u2018solution\u2019: a shift to what he calls \u2018Capitalism 3.0\u2019, which he defines magically as \u201ca shift of awareness that extends the natural self-interest of the players to the entire ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, Dr. Scharmer doesn\u2019t really offer a definition of capitalism that has anything remotely to do with economics, finance, relations of production or anything.\n\nCapitalism, he says, has already been \u2018evolving\u2019 \u2014 and improving \u2014 from being solely ego-centric and growth oriented, resulting in massive social and environmental costs, toward a more stakeholder-oriented system.\n\nScharmer conceives of this \u2018evolution\u2019 as being \u201cbased on a different state of awareness among its players\u201d \u2014 consciousness evolution, he believes, is driving capitalism\u2019s evolution.\n\nToday\u2019s capitalism, Capitalism 2.0, he writes \u2014 seemingly with a straight face \u2014 is \u201cmore regulated\u201d than before. It has wondrous new social security systems, labour unions, environmental standards, much of which are supported by the activities of hundreds of thousands of NGOs. As such, he declares that \u201cthe main focus of capitalism 2.0 is on redistribution in order to sustain society as a whole.\u201d\n\nThis, supposedly, is the defining nature of the current age of capitalism.\n\nReally?\n\nIn one fell swoop, Scharmer manages to obscure what is really going on.\n\nIt\u2019s widely recognized that the defining feature of today\u2019s extreme form of neoliberal capitalism is all about imposing grand-scale financial market deregulation, designed to shift power over economic policy from the public to the private sector, from the government to an unaccountable financial elite. This is the same ideology which has exponentially accelerated the debt and financial volatility we now see in the global economy.\n\nAnd it is precisely this rampaging expansion of unregulated neoliberal globalization, which has led to the steady dismantlement of state-led regulatory apparatuses established between the 1940s and 70s. That, in turn, has generated an army of largely impotent NGOs campaigning desperately, usually on deaf ears, to restrain this increasingly predatory financial system.\n\nThose civil society movements, then, emerged not as a benevolent outpouring of the existing capitalist system \u2014 representing an expansion of its overall consciousness \u2014 but out of conflict with the prevailing system: struggle between those who monopolize access to resources, and those dispossessed from that access.\n\nThis was not some sort of teleological process of \u2018consciousness\u2019 evolution.\n\nAnd yet, Scharmer himself concedes that the friendlier \u2018capitalism 2.0\u2019 \u201cdoes not appear to be working to mitigate the current global externalities\u201d. Within his logic, the actual reasons for this appear unfathomable.\n\nThat is why, under Scharmer\u2019s \u2018capitalism 2.0\u2019, global inequalities have widened, and the number of people living under $5 a day \u2014 a more realistic poverty line than the World Bank\u2019s $1.90 \u2014 has dramatically increased. Today, 4.3 billion people, nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, live on less than $5 a day.\n\nThat is why, what is actually happening is that state-failures, extremist nationalism, Islamist terrorism and other phenomena are being driven by a convergence of economic and ecological crises, which are intensifying within a broken economic model that is hell-bent on accelerating extraction at any human, social or environmental cost.\n\nWork on your ego, and the corporate world will obediently follow\n\nPerusing Scharmer\u2019s work, it becomes painfully clear that he is ill-equipped to engage with the interconnected complexity of this systemic crisis.\n\nScharmer\u2019s basic limitation is his starting point: organizational change theory. He remarks that it is standard practice for leadership teams in global companies to do \u2018inner change work\u2019 to help shift an individual\u2019s awareness \u201cfrom an ego-system to an extended stakeholder situation or, in some cases, to the larger ecosystem\u201d.\n\nNeoclassical economists, he says, do not acknowledge how changes in \u201chuman awareness and consciousness\u201d can \u201cinfluence human behaviour\u201d. And so he concludes that \u201cthe biggest blind spot in economic theory today [is] consciousness \u2014 that is, the structure of human awareness and attention that a community of actors develops when they go on a journey of transformational change.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? Don\u2019t worry about the economics: let\u2019s have Scharmer and his crack team lead the employees of all the giant corporates currently extracting from the planet at break-neck pace, and have them go through mind-expanding \u201cjourneys of transformational change\u201d \u2014 this will change their behaviour, and the behaviour of their companies, and transform capitalism into a juggernaut of collective, orgasmic altruism.\n\nThis, basically, is what\u2019s going on at the MIT Presencing Institute.\n\nCan we get real here, please? The stark truth is that Scharmer is casting a net of beauty on a far more mundane process of corporate cultural institutional conditioning: improving the productivity of workers.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter what company employees think they are experiencing. For the most part, their \u201ctransformational change\u201d is designed to condition the individual to \u201cembrace the larger forces of change\u201d that constitute the narrow profit-maximizing imperatives of the company itself. The end result is not a transformation of how these companies operate in the world, but instead, the cultural conditioning of employees into the belief that submerging themselves in the corporate values and vision of their employers is, indeed, part of a \u2018transformative\u2019 process.\n\nInside the wondrous \u2018ego-to-eco\u2019 transformation of Google\n\nA quick glance at some of the corporations that Scharmer has run leadership and innovation programs for illustrates the problem: firms like Alibaba, Daimler, Fujitsu, Google, and PriceWaterhouse. Yet these companies do not exhibit meaningful processes of transformational change \u2014 in fact, we see the opposite.\n\nLet\u2019s take Google, one of Otto Scharmer\u2019s transformational change clients.\n\nWhat has Scharmer\u2019s innovation and leadership program done to transform Google\u2019s structural entanglement with the US military-industrial complex? What has it done, for that matter, to transform anything meaningfully at Google?\n\nWe might refer to Google\u2019s oft-stated declarations of reducing its carbon footprint to zero while transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2018.\n\nYet according to Lux Research, Google uses an obsolete tool to calculate its data center emissions from purchasing electricity from the power grid. Consequently, in four out of seven data centers, Google underestimates its dependence on coal by 30 percent or more.\n\nAnd then there is Google\u2019s primary technique for reducing its footprint to zero: buying carbon offsets \u2014 that is, investing in outsider green energy projects, allowing Google to claim the equivalent in \u2018emissions reductions\u2019 on its own books. Although their actual real-world emissions have not reduced at all.\n\nWhile Google has been trumpeting its zero carbon trajectory \u2014 receiving accolades from Greenpeace along the way \u2014 its gross carbon emissions have actually increased.\n\nOver the last half decade alone, Google\u2019s gross carbon emissions have more than doubled.\n\nIn 2011, Google recorded its gross CO2 emissions at 1,677,423 metric tons.\n\nIn 2012, the company reported a 9% drop in its gross emissions to 1.5 metric tons. Yet even here, the drop was achieved not by a real material drop in emissions, but by factoring in deductions from Google\u2019s power purchase agreements (PPA). So the real gross emissions figure for that year, calculated in the same way the 2011 figures were calculated, was 2,024,444 metric tons.\n\nBy 2016, Google\u2019s gross carbon emissions had grown to 2.9 million metric tons according to the company\u2019s 2017 progress report.\n\nThe net result?\n\nGoogle\u2019s actual carbon footprint is growing exponentially. Yet environmental certifications, such as that produced by Greenpeace, are being used to sanitize and legitimize this growth.\n\nGoogle now claims that \u201cbecause of our renewable energy and carbon offset programs, our net operational carbon emissions were zero. Because of our emissions-reduction efforts, our carbon intensity has steadily decreased even as our company has grown and our energy use has correspondingly increased.\u201d\n\nAll this is true, but it is ultimately a clever carbon accounting trick that allows Google\u2019s real-world carbon emissions to continue accelerating. Which is why, despite all this self-congratulatory nonsense about the \u2018greening\u2019 of the internet, our current global emissions trajectory is so bad it could end up heading to an uninhabitable 8C planet by end of century.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that Google is simultaneously funding climate deniers. Google hosted a fundraiser for notorious climate-denying Senator James Inhofe; donated $50,000 for a fundraising dinner for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an ultra-conservative outfit that attempts to sue climate scientists for fraud; and is a member of the US Chamber of Commerce, which consistently lobbies to block action on climate change and promotes fossil fuels.\n\nBut it\u2019s all okay, because Google got an \u2018A\u2019 certification from Greenpeace.\n\nIn other words, such sustainability metrics might be good for business; but for the planet, they are meaningless.\n\nTheir application isn\u2019t slowing the pace of fossil fuel extraction \u2014 they are accelerating extraction under the cover of saving the climate.\n\nStenographic liberal \u2018journalism\u2019\n\nAnd thus, with the help of misleading number crunching, an exponentially increasing carbon footprint is misreported as a decreasing carbon footprint.\n\nUnfortunately, you won\u2019t find any dissecting of Google\u2019s grand claims from the mainstream liberal press. Instead, Huffington Post \u2014 Otto Scharmer\u2019s media partner of choice to \u2018transform capitalism\u2019 \u2014 bravely reported Google\u2019s acclaimed clean carbon footprint trajectory without any investigation of the facts.\n\nThus, HuffPo \u2014 along with a host of liberal media outlets like The Guardian whose stenographic reporting conveniently erases the reality of Google\u2019s increasing carbon emissions \u2014 obfuscates the real systemic causes of the Crisis of Civilization.\n\nStultifying liberal \u2018philanthropy\u2019\n\nThe main funders for the HuffPo-MIT project are a Geneva-based foundation, Partners for a New Economy, and an Atlanta-based foundation, the Kendeda Fund.\n\nBoth foundations are important players on the spectrum of liberal philanthropy. They are part of a whole network of such foundations.\n\nIn March 2017, for instance, I\u2019d been invited to Boston by the director of Partners for a New Economy to do a keynote speech on the future of philanthropy for the Biodiversity Funders Group (formerly, the Consultative Group on Biological Diversity).\n\nThis is the premier forum of philanthropic foundations focused on environmental issues, comprising 67 organisations including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and many others.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that these philanthropic foundations have no real idea what\u2019s actually wrong with the existing system, and therefore no clue as to what they should be funding. So they end up funding self-soothing, self-serving ideological nonsense that merely distracts from real solutions.\n\nLayer upon layer of self-soothing delusion\n\nAnd so we come full circle.\n\nThis is the interlocking network of liberal progressive do-gooding that is continuing to escalate the destruction of the planet.\n\nAll these years I\u2019d been exposing and investigating the system of extraction in its various manifestations \u2014 mass surveillance, covert operations, military invasions, fossil fuel extraction, rampant debt-acceleration.\n\nAnd yet I have begun to see that the real enemy, the real forces preventing us from actually responding to this system meaningfully, was something entirely different. The real enemy to transformation is among the harbingers of change themselves.\n\nThe real enemy is amongst ourselves.\n\nIn this liberal progressive world of philanthropists, foundations, trusts, charities, NGOs, platforms, outlets and beyond, a great deal of activity, though dressed up in the language of \u2018change\u2019, is not authentic. This language conveniently disguises the fact that actors in this space are still playing the extraction game. They appropriate the discourse of \u2018systemic transformation\u2019, and use it to sanitize and legitimize the very system of extraction that they are professing to transform. And they believe that their way is the only way.\n\nLayer upon layer of self-soothing delusion serves to mask and intensify what are in fact behaviors that support extraction. They appear benign, and there are all sorts of rationalizations, excuses and explanations for their behavior: ideological indoctrination, structural constraints, social conditioning, psychological ailments, or simple incompetence.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter. Because the current configuration of liberal progressive myopia constitutes the most dangerous obstacle to saving people and planet that currently exists. It is standing in the way of real alternatives, real solutions. It is co-opting the emergence of genuine possibilities, ideas, movements and ventures with transformative potential, and absorbing them within the framework of accelerated extraction.\n\nThe central insight here is that liberal progressive discourse, right now, is precisely the ideology by which the system of extraction is accelerating and consolidating. By positioning themselves as transformers of the system, the liberal progressive mirage is in fact legitimizing and extending the system through the language of \u2018change\u2019.",

        "title": "Does Your Pain Stem from Trapped Emotion?",
        "text": "Before I put pen to paper, my thoughts were about researching and offering quotes from eminent free-thinking experts and authors.\n\nI examined information available in books and online, only to discover many so-called specialists disagree about pain stored in the body via anxiety.\n\nMostly, they fall out over how to release tension and cure physical angst. They all agree, nonetheless, emotions affect physical health.\n\nI was perplexed, then I realized I have plenty of real-life data to share. In my former days as a counselor, and simply as someone interested in health and the way feelings influence well-being, I have learned a great deal.\n\nHere\u2019s what I know for certain. (Backed by science and experience rather than New Age theories about which people can\u2019t agree).\n\nEvery time you experience an emotion you have a physical response.\n\nWhen you are stressed, your blood flow changes. Anger, for instance, increases blood flow in the brain.\n\nDr. Michael Roizen, MD states blood flow is also reduced in certain areas. \u201cWork published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that stress was linked to reduced blood flow to the heart (myocardial ischemia) and other vital organs. People who had a lot of stress also had more periods of inadequate blood flow to the heart, leading to a correspondingly higher risk of heart attacks and abnormal heart rhythms.\u201d\n\nSo anxiety alters the flow of blood in your body, presumably preparing you for fight, freeze, or flight.\n\nWhat about long-term stress?\n\nYou\u2019re not built to sustain chronic stress well. Life-threatening events that cause severe anxiety are meant to be over quickly.\n\nHence, in the past humans might be terrified by a vicious, hungry creature who wanted them for breakfast, but they would be killed fast or run away to safety. It would all be over in a short while either way.\n\nThese days, you\u2019re likely to encounter stress that isn\u2019t as horrific but lasts for days, weeks, months, or even years. With the knowledge stress changes optimal functioning (restricting blood to the heart and other organs and increasing it elsewhere) you understand there\u2019s a problem. Stress can kill when chronic if not addressed.\n\nAll emotion influences your body\n\nIf it were just blood flow that alters when you\u2019re stressed, although a huge issue, that would be one thing. It\u2019s not though.\n\nEach emotion also impacts the rest of your body. The results might not kill you, but they can lead to serious health issues. Mostly, they result in debilitating aches and pains.\n\nIf you don\u2019t recognize what causes such ailments, you will take medication to mask painful symptoms. Although, of course, not all illnesses stem from emotions, those that are stress-related need to be acknowledged. They are pleas for help registered physically so you can see and feel them and take note.\n\nCase study\n\nI once counseled a woman who was brought up to believe expressing anger was unforgivable. She came to me when her marriage was in tatters and her husband was abusive.\n\nWhat she couldn\u2019t express, anger, played out for her to see big time in her husband\u2019s actions. She herself was furious, as well as afraid, but channeled rage into her jaw.\n\nI didn\u2019t look for a connection between her physical ailments and what was happening. I was a rookie at the time, new to practicing, and intent on following the guidelines I\u2019d been taught rather than anything else.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but note, though, my client\u2019s physical distress \u2014 terrible toothache and jaw pain \u2014 always coincided with what she called \u201cbad patches\u201d in her marriage.\n\nWhen her private life was calm, her pain left. When it raged like a storm so did her physical pain. Conventional medical treatment didn\u2019t help her.\n\nIt numbed the pain, but didn\u2019t cure the problem because it couldn\u2019t. Her symptoms were a build-up of emotional tension. They expressed her psyche\u2019s need for change and her need to express her feelings promptly rather than squash it into her jaw.\n\nI found out later anger often resides in the jaw and influences oral health too. Not only do some people grind their teeth at night due to anger, but rage makes them tighten their jaw at the moment it\u2019s experienced.\n\nImagine, for a moment, holding tension in your hand on and off all day long and doing so again day after day. What would your hand feel like? What would be its condition?\n\nSurely, it would become sore and you might develop a problem. The same is true for any part of your body where tension is held regularly.\n\nThe cure, in my client\u2019s case, was to instigate and embrace positive change and learn to express her emotions when she felt them. I also taught her how to use her emotions to have a positive influence on her body. Acknowledgment, however, is step one in the process.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nYou can\u2019t change something you don\u2019t recognize exists. Thus, there\u2019s a need to identify the pain in your neck occurs when someone you\u2019d rather not deal with is literally a pain in the neck.\n\nOr, the situation you face at work is a nightmare (so you\u2019re having nightmares).\n\nOr you\u2019ve become mentally inflexible (so your back feels like it\u2019s made of stiff material and aches).\n\nOr a wound isn\u2019t healing as fast as it should because something\u2019s eating away at you.\n\nOr your heart problem erupts when stressful events occur in your life.\n\nOr the cancer you thought you\u2019d kicked to the curb returns when you have a huge family argument/you are bereaved/you lose your job.\n\nNot all physical ailments and disease are caused by emotional withholding, but many are, and even more get worse due to stress even when they have genetic origins.\n\nIf you experience an ongoing ailment medication can\u2019t fix, or no one can explain, could it be a symptom of emotions expressed by your body? Acknowledge the possibility, even if you are uncertain. Stay open-minded.\n\nThe next step\n\nLike my client, after noting the problem and why it might occur, the next thing to do is instigate positive change. (If you can).\n\nNow and then, people go through difficult times and must endure them for various reasons. Maybe the timing\u2019s off, or finances and support make a difference. If you must live with a chronic difficulty, you can still improve your physical and mental condition in the ways that follow.\n\nExpress your emotions as they happen\n\nWhether you express emotions at once or not, they will create a physical reaction. (It\u2019s an inbuilt survival mechanism).\n\nPainful emotions won\u2019t get stuck, however, if you do something with them rather than push them away.\n\nExpression doesn\u2019t mean you must shout and scream at someone who upsets you to release tension. You might aim to improve communication, though, write your feelings in a journal, talk to a trusted friend or relative, and let tension go in other ways. Physical exertion or relaxation helps too.\n\nIf you\u2019re angry on Monday, however, don\u2019t wait until your dance class on Friday to let off steam. By then, your emotions might have taken residence in your muscles, shoulders, neck, back, or jaw. Engage in helpful behaviors as soon as possible.\n\nMake positive emotions work for you\n\nI don\u2019t really like using the terms positive and negative emotions, but I will since we know what we mean.\n\n(All emotions are positive as they exist for a good reason; to help us in some way. What we do with them makes all the difference.)\n\nPositive emotions stemming from a sense of peace and relaxation, joy, love, or gratitude impact you physically. They can also help heal tension and act as release mechanisms.\n\nBoost loving feelings\n\nConnect love with joy. Think of someone you love (or a beloved pet) with whom you associate no anxiety. So, you might still love your ex, but focus on someone else.\n\nSomeone who fills your heart with joy instead of breaks it or makes you want to dance rather than drop your shoulders and cast down your gaze.\n\nTake deep, slow breaths, and place one hand over your heart. Imagine you are breathing into your heart as you think of the person or pet you love. Continue for a few minutes and you\u2019ll create heart resonance.\n\nHere\u2019s the exercise mentioned provided by nurse educator Jackie Kakuska, Ms. Rn. Join in when you want to increase positive emotions and release stress.\n\nHere\u2019s another great, simple video to help you breathe in a healing way for ten minutes.\n\nThis is what the makers of the video above say about resonant breathing.\n\n\u201cResearch has demonstrated that if you were to engage in resonant breathing for 10 minutes/day every day for 8 weeks, you would literally retrain (reprogram) your autonomic nervous system for increased Heart Rate Variability \u2014 a measure of good health. The benefits are many: reduced blood pressure, lowered anxiety and depression, improvement in asthma, COPD, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel, and more.\u201d\n\nEngage in resonant breathing, particularly the HeartMath way as described by the nurse in the first video provided, and according to science (and my experience) your stress-related ailments will fade and you\u2019ll gain a sense of calm. Your thinking will become clearer and you\u2019ll handle stress well. At the same time, illness not caused by stress, but which stress worsens will improve.\n\nStress isn\u2019t supposed to make you ill. It\u2019s a reaction to what\u2019s happening in your environment and negative self-talk. Listen to its message and change unhappy conditions when you can. Increase positive emotions and reduce those that damage you with the suggestions above and your well-being will grow.",

        "title": "Want To Write Like Aaron Sorkin? Start By Being Bored",
        "text": "Image Credit: David Torcivia on Flickr\n\nAaron Sorkin never wrote for fun until after college. Which is insane. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with his work he is responsible for A Few Good Men, The American President, The West Wing, The Social Network, The Newsroom, and a long list of other movies and TV shows. He is screenwriting royalty, and he got there because he was bored.\n\nOn the Bill Simmons podcast, Aaron Sorkin talks about the first time he ever wrote for fun.\n\nThe year is 1985. There is no Tinder, Snapchat, or Netflix. Smartphones and the internet don\u2019t even exist yet. Aaron Sorkin was sharing a studio apartment. His friends were all out of town or at a party he wasn\u2019t invited too. He had $3 in his pocket; the tv and stereo were broken. It was pure boredom. The only thing in the apartment was a semi-automatic typewriter and blank pieces of paper.\n\nSorkin talks about how the first time he wrote for fun was writing dialogue. He said,\n\n\u201cI loved it, I stayed up all night writing and I feel like that night has never ended.\u201d\n\nThink about that. We could have been robbed of Moneyball, Charlie Wilson\u2019s War, and Sports Night had it not been for boredom.\n\nSorkin goes on to say, \u201cThere are too many easy boredom killers.\u201d and it\u2019s easy to see what he is talking about. We live in a time where everything is competing for our time. Companies spend billions of dollars to steal more of your time. They feed off your boredom, but it might be time to start using your boredom to feed your creative self.\n\nPeople put off starting things. That article, book, or screenplay they want to write is put on the shelf until they have the time to do it. In the meantime, their distractions get in the way, and they never feel like they have the time because they are continually keeping themselves from being bored.\n\nOur culture doesn\u2019t make it any easier on us. Sorkin says, \u201cPeople are curating there lives now,\u201d and it is easy to see what he is talking about. Now there is a pressure not to be bored. To continually be engaged, and with the social pressure to be \u201cliving your best life,\u201d the idea of being bored for a lot of people is terrifying.\n\nBeing bored gives you the opportunity to delve creativity. To sit alone with your thoughts and challenge us to expand our creative expressions. Be bored, reach for that blank piece of paper instead of your phone. Find the stories that are hiding inside of you, instead of the distractions that are always waiting for you.\n\nA working TV or stereo could have robbed us of some of the most exceptional dialogue in television and movie history, and I can\u2019t help but wonder what kind of works of art are we missing out on because people refuse to let themselves be bored.",

        "title": "Debunking the Viral Talking Dog of Tik Tok",
        "text": "As a pet owner, there\u2019s nothing more than I would love if my cats could talk to us. When our cats Maya and Wyatt are acting irrationally, I often tell my beautiful girlfriend, Tristin, that I wish they could talk. I also wonder what they would say if they could talk. Our cat Maya seems to have the most random mood swings where she\u2019s purring and cuddling you one minute, and the next minute she\u2019s scratching you. Meanwhile, Wyatt just seems like a grumpy old man, and I think, \u201cIf this cat could talk for a day, what would he say? Would he have a conversation with us or just demand for us to give him more food?\u201d\n\nWell, if you\u2019re like me and dream of a day where animals can talk to me, you may be inclined to believe the videos of this viral Tik Tok dog are real. Alexis Devine is the owner Bunny, a dog who uses buttons to communicate with Alexis. Although I wish this were real, today, we\u2019re going to debunk Bunny.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, dogs are extremely smart creatures. In fact, many animals are. As a big fan of the psychologist BF Skinner, I know that behaviorism is extremely effective. With the right incentives, we can train animals to just about anything, but unfortunately, talking isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nWhile there are some skeptics who think Alexis simply showcases the best takes of Bunny using these buttons, based on the research, I think there\u2019s more of a psychological explanation. We\u2019re going to discuss the ideomotor effect and how it can make animals appear to be smarter than they are, but first, we need to understand the human tendency of anamorphism.\n\nIn their book The Mind Club: Who Thinks, What Feels, and Why It Matters, Daniel Wegner and Kurt Gray dedicate an entire chapter to why we attribute minds to certain animals but not to others. This is a fascinating chapter, but for the purpose of this video, we\u2019re going to focus on anamorphism. Anamorphism is a distorted projection or perspective; especially an image distorted in such a way that it becomes visible only when viewed in a special manner.\n\nAnamorphism is the reason why people like Alexis can easily make us believe that Bunny can talk with these buttons, and Alexis probably believes it as well. When we understand the history of talking animals, we can get a little closer to the truth, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to discuss the story of the math-solving horse named Clever Hans.\n\nIf you prefer the video, I did a video essay version on my YouTube channel\n\nDebunking Clever Hans\n\nOver 100 years prior to Alexis and her talking dog Bunny was a math-solving horse by the name of Clever Hans. In the early 1900s, a man by the name of Herr Wilhelm Von Osten owned a horse named Hans who could apparently solve complex math equations. A horse that can solve complex math is quite the sight, so Von Osten made quite a bit of money touring with Hans and doing shows.\n\nVon Osten taught Hans to not only add and subtract, but Hans could multiply, divide, and work with fractions. Unlike Bunny, Hans didn\u2019t have buttons to press, so he would count out the answers by tapping his hoof. If you asked Hans \u201cWhat\u2019s 12 plus 12?\u201d, he would tap his hoof 24 times. \u201cWhat\u2019s 10 divided by 2?\u201d Hans would tap 5 times. Much like Bunny, it was incredible. Back then, they didn\u2019t have TikTok or viral sites like Mashable, so Hans mainly received his clout from newspapers and word of mouth.\n\nBut, even though people were more likely to believe in the unbelievable back then, there were still skeptics and critical thinkers. Some of these critical thinkers were psychologists, and they believed that there was a better explanation for Clever Hans than a horse being able to do math.\n\nThis psychologist was a man by the name of Carl Stumpf, and his work is referenced in some of my favorite books on supernatural psychology like Supersense by Bruce Hood and Paranormality by Richard Wiseman. I actually first learned of Carl Stumpf in The Skeptic\u2019s Guide to the Universe by Dr. Steven Novella. Stumpf\u2019s work is so popular because, during a time when people believed much more in the supernatural, he was brave enough to go against the group and try to discover the truth.\n\nStumpf was able to get Von Osten to agree to let a team research Clever Hans to see if the horse really had these abilities or if it was something else. In order to do this, they had to set up a series of experiments, and the first variable they wanted to factor out was Von Osten. To ensure Von Osten wasn\u2019t somehow giving Hans the answers or saying some type of code with his wording, they had other people ask Hans the questions. Surprisingly, Hans was still able to answer correctly.\n\nScore 1 for Clever Hans and Von Osten\n\nBut then, Stumpf started to wonder if Hans was clever but just in a different way. If Hans wasn\u2019t getting the answer through language, maybe it was through sight. So, Stumpf and his team hid Von Osten from Hans\u2019 view with a sheet, and Von Osten would ask the questions. Low and behold, Hans couldn\u2019t get any of the answers right. Then, they duplicated Hans\u2019 inaccuracies with other people.\n\nSo, what was going on?\n\nWhile many people would assume that Von Osten somehow figured out signals to give to Hans intentionally, the consensus is that Von Osten was just as clueless as everyone else. This is when Stumpf and his colleagues discovered that we often make unconscious movements without even realizing it, which was later called the ideomotor effect. If you remember my previous video on ouija boards for the supernatural psychology series, this explains why we believe ouija boards are actually being moved by spirits beyond the grave.\n\nMuch like other animals, Clever Hans was extremely intelligent, but in a different way. Hans didn\u2019t know how to do complex math, but he did know how to read the slightest body movements when he would tap and reach the right answer. These subtle movements were his signal to stop tapping, which gave the appearance of him knowing the answer.\n\nSo, now that we know the story of Clever Hans and the ideomotor effect, what\u2019s up with Alexis and her dog Bunny?\n\nSo, What\u2019s Up with Bunny?\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure some of you reading are upset and defending Bunny. You\u2019re looking for explanations that explain how Bunny is the real deal, and I get it. Some of you may even be pointing to gorillas who use sign language as proof that animals can speak. Yes, it\u2019s true that some primates can use sign language, but we often neglect to realize that the brain of a gorilla and the brain of a dog are completely different.\n\nAs humans, we make the mistake of lumping many animals together, but the reality is that they all have different capabilities based on the nuances of their evolution. We need to remember that the brain of a gorilla is much closer to the brain of a human than a dog\u2019s brain is to a gorilla.\n\nSo, is Alexis lying to us? Is this all a setup to go viral?\n\nPersonally, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, so I don\u2019t think Alexis is playing an elaborate hoax on all of us. I choose to believe that much like Clever Hans and Von Osten, Alexis may not realize that she\u2019s giving Bunny cues that give the appearance that Bunny can talk.\n\nWithout doing a proper experiment, it\u2019d be hard to prove my theory, so, I thought we could just discuss what a proper experiment would look like.\n\nMuch like with the story of Clever Hans, we\u2019d have to run an experiment with multiple variables. First, we\u2019d need to see if Bunny would answer when someone else asks the questions, and we\u2019d also need to see if Bunny could answer without seeing the person. Bunny might be extremely smart, but like Hans, she\u2019s most likely reading other cues.\n\nAnother theory I have is that Bunny notices the happy tone in Alexis\u2019 voice when she presses buttons that are coherent. This type of conditioning can train Bunny to press certain sequences.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that we would need an experiment to verify that Bunny wanted what she said. For example, if Bunny used the buttons saying she was hungry but didn\u2019t eat, that would disconfirm Bunny\u2019s understanding of language. Or, what if Bunny said she needed to go outside to use the bathroom but didn\u2019t go? Remember, a good scientist always tries to debunk themselves to find alternative explanations for events.\n\nFinally, as a skeptic, I think it\u2019s important to point out how we attribute meanings to the meaningless. As we\u2019ve discussed in other articles, our brains are constantly trying to make connections. This is why we believe in superstitions, but it\u2019s also why we think our pets are trying to communicate. At the 2:34 mark of the Mashable video, Alexis repeats what Bunny\u2019s buttons pressed, \u201cLove you. No.\u201d And this is just another example of anamorphism.\n\nI\u2019d be willing to bet that if you monitored Bunny for an entire day, you\u2019d see her pressing a bunch of random buttons that we could somehow find meaning in some of the gibberish. Like the infinite monkey theorem states: a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text.",

        "title": "How Writing to the Dead Saved My Life",
        "text": "I was never 100% convinced I deserved to die, until recently.\n\nI knew this wave of depression was going to be harder to survive because I started to burn the most important of bridges. I quit my job, I got into arguments about the smallest things and took conscious steps to make my family hate me. I\u2019m bipolar with rapid cycling. Fresh diagnosis, but I knew for a long time.\n\nI\u2019ve been suicidal before in my life, during the depressive and mixed states, but never had the \u2018guts\u2019 to go through with it. I\u2019m painfully aware of the statistics surrounding suicidality and bipolar disorder, with apparently a third of us attempting suicide at least once. Apparently, these increase with comorbidity (other \u201cdisorders\u201d also present).\n\nI considered myself lucky and grateful, because there were people who were worse off than me. Quite shitty, I know. It wore off pretty quickly for the same reason. There were people who were struggling more than I was. This thought took up a lot of my time. It still didn\u2019t let me put my life into a wider context and get out of what I saw as a cycle of inability to problem solve and falling into bad coping mechanisms, that I should have control over.\n\nI\u2019m clearly writing now, I\u2019m alive. Spoiler. I asked for help, it was a process.\n\nWithout beating around the bush \u2014 I really thought I had it all figured out. All evidence was telling me I was an imposter with unrealistic and pretentious dreams; a fake, unsuccessful creative who hasn\u2019t created anything of worth in well over a year. My perspective was tainted with years of self-pity, laziness and addiction. Less than a month after graduating with a master\u2019s degree, I finally decided that everything I did was defective. That I was inherently defective.\n\nPeople have all sorts of reactions to success. I don\u2019t know whether my mood worsened because of burn out or fearing of not being able to excel in the job market as much as I did in education. My family moved to another country, sacrificing everything including our emotional stability and sense of self-worth, for exactly that reason. Like many, I grew up in a household that valued productivity, success and hard work. My parents are smart, resourceful and resilient people. Whilst they inspired me, people talked about my achievements and potential. I felt unable to deliver.\n\nAnyway, I was sticking around. I was hurting myself as damage control. I was hurting myself during episodes where I felt like I wasn\u2019t present in my body. It sometimes felt like the sentence could be carried out at any time. The compulsion to wait just a little longer really confused me. I already saw myself as unable to live a stable, dignified life.\n\nWhen I could, in the past, I explored my feelings, thoughts and purpose through writing. I\u2019ve practiced freewriting/journaling for many years now, exactly for that reason. At the time, my ability to write was seriously impaired though. I struggled with the physical aspect and I began to fear the psychological side of it. I felt too embarrassed to write, because over time, I gave this simple activity a lot of weight and significance. I was so used to being marked or paid for it. For the first time ever, I didn\u2019t know what or who I was writing for. I just knew I needed to. I needed that final confirmation that my inner dialogue was exhausted. Settled. But most of all, I think I needed an answer different to the deadly conclusions I kept methodically coming to.\n\nIt had to be completely private. My writing definitely couldn\u2019t be addressed to anyone, just in case.\n\nI needed a safe space to explore my thoughts and feelings about life and death. I always thought talking to experts was most efficient and there is no better expert in life and death than a dead person. Right? So, without much thought, I chose the first dead person that popped into my head. There was the obvious advantage of not causing anybody any real harm; no risk of subconsciously damaging or straining any relationship; nobody to judge me.\n\nI rejected Catholicism since I remember. I don\u2019t have a clue about what happens after death. I just want to make that clear because talking to the dead was something, I only thought religious people did.\n\nI started scribbling a formal \u201cDear Babcia Marysia.\u201d She didn\u2019t know a word of English, it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 she\u2019s been dead for about two years and a half.\n\nHonestly, at first it still felt a bit embarrassing. Very awkward. Like that phone call with a relative you were supposed to have a long time ago. My first thought was that I didn\u2019t ring her enough before she died. I felt obliged to apologise. So, I apologised.\n\nThe truth is I literally never actually rang my now dead grandma. She never let me realise this though, until now. I felt ashamed but quietly grateful for how loving this simple act was. This shame was just not as soul-destroying.\n\nI spent a lot of time writing to her, trying to explain my life away to make myself feel like a better human being. Explaining that that we grew apart because of distance and because life just never seemed to stop for us. That there were always problems, conflicts and my way of dealing was moving away halfway across the country; that I pretty much lost touch with my parents too, until recently.\n\nI wrote in all states, about everything including things I\u2019ll probably never discuss again. It took weeks of stopping mid-sentence and coming back with \u201cI\u2019m back, I just felt so pathetic and couldn\u2019t subject you to any more of this.\u201d Just to spill out a little bit more.\n\nWriting to a dead relative like my grandma, stimulated a conversation with the memory of someone whose past love towards you, you have no control over. And even if shame comes up, it\u2019s towards a dead person. You can\u2019t make things better there, they are dead. You have to let it go. I promised us both that I would try my best to not treat another human this way. I began focusing on the living. What I could do.\n\nThrough exploring death by writing to somebody dead, I became instinctively drawn to aspects of life that the living have control over. I\u2019m still a little mind-blown about this whole process, but I feel like it\u2019s the purest proof that your body and mind\u2019s primary function is to keep you alive. I think connection plays a significant part in keeping you alive. It nourishes us and we all need nourishment. This was true for me.\n\nI started to carry my rosary on me. My mum gave me a few over the years and they always reminded me of my grandma since she prayed for everybody, all of her life. I don\u2019t use them to pray, I use them to remember, which I guess could be seen as the same thing.\n\nThis whole process provided me with a safe space to frame my own life in a wider context of family and forces that were at play long before I was born. War. Generational trauma and patterns that I could suddenly see everywhere (I\u2019ll share this research later). We\u2019ve had alcoholics, life-long drug users, gamblers, criminals, suicides. I fell into a club, I wasn\u2019t alone. I began relating. I began feeling normal. My narrative started shifting, it became intertwined with others. I kept writing through it and that created an urge to talk to those who were a part of my story, our pain. Mostly hoping, that they would remind me if a violent change in mental state made me forget, again.\n\nTo put it simply: The act of writing itself kept me physically and mentally busy. It gave me more time. It became a way of building a bridge, back to my loved ones and importantly, myself.\n\nIt\u2019s so much easier to climb back up with the support of others, with the weight shared.\n\nDo reach out.",

        "text": "Why Trustworthiness Matters in Building Global Futures\n\nNo matter how compelling our technologies are, they are only as good as the trust people have in the organizations that develop and govern them.\n\nTIGTech \u2014 Seven Drivers of Trust\n\nWe\u2019re standing at a pivotal point in our collective response to the coronavirus pandemic. The first vaccine against the virus is beginning to be rolled out, with others hot on its heels, and we can begin to imagine a post-COVID future albeit tentatively.\n\nYet despite the incredible strides being made, hope is being tempered by hesitancy-and sometimes downright distrust-as a growing number of people question the safety of the vaccine, and even the motives behind it.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss this resistance to the COVID vaccine as irrational thinking, a rejection of science, and an unquestioning acceptance of misinformation and disinformation. Yet it points to a bigger issue of trust: Trust in how science and technology are governed, and more specifically, how organizations earn trust through being trustworthy.\n\nTo Earn Trust, Organizations Need to be Trustworthy\n\nEarning trust is a challenge that goes far beyond the current pandemic, and touches on pretty much every aspect of our connections with the future. No matter how compelling our science is, how transformative our technologies are, or how important our ideas of the future might be, they are only as good as the trust that people place in the organizations that develop and use them.\n\nBut how is trust developed and maintained as we strive to build a better future together?\n\nFor the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been a member of the advisory Panel for TIGTech, an initiative supported by the World Economic Forum and Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research that\u2019s focused on trust, governance and technology innovation.\n\nTIGTech was established to explore and provide guidance on what it means for governance approaches to new technologies to be trustworthy, and how trust is earned. The focus of the work has been on emerging technologies and large institutions. Yet the findings and recommendations are relevant to anyone trying to build a better future within today\u2019s highly complex and deeply interconnected world.\n\nTowards a more Engaged, Collaborative and Communicative Approach to Trust & Tech Governance\n\nLast Friday, the first major report from TIGTech was released, and it highlights the need for developing more engaged, collaborative, communicative approaches to trustworthy and trusted technology governance. It als provides practical steps toward achieving this.\n\nTIGTech \u2014 Towards a more engaged, collaborative, communicative approach\n\nThe report is, I am very pleased to say, written for real people grappling with real challenges, and is not in the slightest academic-although the underlying foundations are academically sound. I would go so far as to say that it should be required reading for anyone who is either studying global futures, or is involved in the process of helping to build a better future.\n\nThe report eloquently focuses on clear and concise nuggets of relevant information for readers- three key findings, five things to know about trust, seven drivers of trust, and three competencies for trusted governance.\n\nThis approach makes it highly accessible. It also makes the insights relevant and actionable to a wide range of individuals and organizations. Plus, it\u2019s deeply refreshing to have such an important document written in plain language that is easy to make sense of!\n\nMany of the points that are made feel like common sense when you read them-yet paradoxically they can\u2019t be, otherwise they would be more commonly found in practice.\n\nFor instance, the three key findings are:\n\nBe more engaged, more visible \u2014 show your impact.\n\nDetach governance from hype and ideology \u2014 focus on the public interest.\n\nGet comfortable with navigating ethics and values.\n\nAnd the seven drivers of trust are:\n\nIntent \u2014 Public Interest (upheld through purpose, process, delivery and outcomes).\n\n(upheld through purpose, process, delivery and outcomes). Competence (delivering against expectation effectively, reliably, consistently, responsively).\n\n(delivering against expectation effectively, reliably, consistently, responsively). Openness (being transparent and accessible in processes, communications, explanations and interactions).\n\n(being transparent and accessible in processes, communications, explanations and interactions). Respect (seeing others as equals; listening to and taking seriously their concerns, views and rights. Considering the potential impact of words & deeds on others).\n\n(seeing others as equals; listening to and taking seriously their concerns, views and rights. Considering the potential impact of words & deeds on others). Integrity (operating honestly, being accountable, impartial and independent of vested interests).\n\n(operating honestly, being accountable, impartial and independent of vested interests). Fairness (enshrining justice and equality in governance processes, application, enforcement, and outcomes). And\n\n(enshrining justice and equality in governance processes, application, enforcement, and outcomes). And Inclusion (being collaborative, inclusive, involving others).\n\nThese are all critically important, and should be part of any future-builders credo. But they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to earning trust. And underpinning them is a nuanced and sophisticated understanding of trust that is essential to developing and using new technologies in the public interest.\n\nTrustworthiness is Foundational to Global Futures Building\n\nBeyond the immediate relevance of the report to technology development and use in the public interest, reading through it, I found myself connecting the ideas it lays out to almost every situation within today\u2019s society where trust is paramount, from communicating and engaging around science, to building a new initiative around global futures, to taking justice, equity, diversity and inclusion seriously, to being a trusted research and education establishment.\n\nHere, I was particularly taken by the report\u2019s exploration of \u201c five more things to know about trust \u201c-these should be essential reading for anyone who\u2019s work involves demonstrating trustworthiness and earning trust.\n\nThese insights include acknowledging that trust is an outcome that\u2019s best-achieved by focusing on others, and that it signals a hope that an organization will fulfill the expectations we have of them. They also emphasize what should be self-evident, but rarely is-that trusting people first makes them more likely to be trustworthy and to trust you back, and that trust is a spectrum, and not an either/or judgement.\n\nAnd importantly, they make it clear that trust is dynamic, messy, personal, and a two-way process.\n\nIn other words, while trust and trustworthiness are critically important for building a better future, the process of earning and demonstrating them is not one if simply follow rules and procedures, or checking boxes. It takes awareness, empathy and humility, and a willingness to embrace the messiness of being human within a complex society as we strive to put others first.\n\nThis is sage advice as we stand at this pivotal point in the fight against COVID. But it\u2019s also important as we look beyond COVID and work together to build a future that is just, equitable, and sustainable, and one which is threaded through with hope and possibility.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019d recommend anyone with an interest in building a better future check out TIGTech, and read the initiative\u2019s recent report on trust and tech governance.",

        "title": "Adaptation as Innovation: Making Content Meaningful",
        "text": "Me in front of my laptop and monitor \u2014 always with multiple windows open :-)\n\nI\u2019ve worked remotely for almost seven years now. This means that I can be in front of my computer during calls without being viewed as inattentive or rude. I simultaneously amaze and annoy my coworkers with my responsiveness to email requests, because I am able to quickly search for information as we discuss things. My work style has unearthed my talents as a sleuth \u2014 always looking to see what others already know or have published on a particular topic of interest. As a result, when we begin new projects, I\u2019m often quick to discover similar projects that have already been completed in our field and to suggest that we build on these efforts instead of recreating them.\n\nI used to fear that this meant that I was lazy or not all that creative. But my colleague, Simone Parrish helped me understand that what I am doing is actually innovating by adapting what already exists for one particular audience or setting to another. This is an important skill, especially in public health, where so many great resources and tools are developed for the public good and are available free of charge.\n\nAdaptation takes content proven in one context and applies it in another. This is both evidence-based and innovative.\n\nEducators, trainers, content providers, and even technologists must be able to identify knowledge needs and adapt evidence-based content to address these needs.\n\nFor the past few years, I\u2019ve been working on developing, managing, and monitoring online learning programs for the Knowledge for Health (K4Health) Project. I can tell you firsthand that a lot of work goes into adapting and synthesizing information so that it can be easily digested online.\n\nFor example, it often takes at least nine months (often more than a year) to develop a course on the Global Health eLearning Center (GHeL). The rigorous review process of GHeL courses ensures that they are reputable resources for the latest technical and programmatic guidance on a wide range of health and development topics. However, as a global resource, courses are developed for a broad audience of stakeholders \u2014 mostly health program managers, service providers, and policy makers.\n\nWhen we asked learners if course content should be adapted to fit local contexts, we received mixed responses. Those who work for the government (U.S. or other countries) often prefer the global perspective. In contrast, people who work at non-governmental organizations (NGOs) at the country or regional level tell us that it would be helpful if the content could be adapted to fit their contexts. This might include translation into local languages and the addition of country-specific case studies.\n\nOne GHeL user wondered:\n\n\u201c\u2026if it is possible to use the local dialect (Filipino) so that it can be used and be easily understood by health care providers who do not have a good command of the English language or competency to cascade the learning into the local dialect. [Rural health care providers] will be able to impart the correct information to their target clients who may belong to the marginalized and uneducated. The essence of the information and knowledge might be lost if they translate information by themselves\u201d \u2014 Tuberculosis Basics course learner, the Philippines.\n\nChampions of adaptation believe that it is key to implementation, community development, program improvement and performance, and knowledge enhancement. Target audiences for localized course content include individuals who may not have a good grasp of the English language and who work directly with the community, such as rural health workers, community health workers, social workers, counselors, community government officials, volunteers, health surveillance assistants, and nurses.\n\nK4Health responded to calls to adapt our global content for local contexts by working with partners in the field and documenting adaptation processes that are efficient, effective, and result in content that is easy to understand and simple to use. Based on our experiences, we recently published an adaptation guide, Making Content Meaningful (also available in French).\n\nIn the guide, we identify three types of adaptation and acknowledge that content adaptation often involves a combination of these approaches:\n\nMaking content appropriate to a specific local and cultural context\n\nTranslating content into a local language\n\nMaking it available through a different delivery method or technology appropriate for a specific local context\n\nWe outline a framework with key steps and questions, accompanied by activity sheets and illustrative examples to guide users in making informed decisions throughout the content adaptation process. The framework is divided into three phases:",

        "title": "How Much Should You \u2018Expose\u2019 Yourself During This Pandemic",
        "text": "How Much Should You \u2018Expose\u2019 Yourself During This Pandemic\n\nStriking the delicate balance between staying-at-home and basking in the outdoors\n\nPhoto by Sara Bertoni\n\nWe are just a couple months shy of the 1-year mark since the first case of Covid-19 was reported. During these past months, human understanding of the disease and how the virus operates has changed dramatically, but much of research is still inconclusive \u2014 owing partly to the fact that it\u2019s nearly impossible for science to prove anything in such a short period of time \u2014 leaving us with a laundry list of \u201cexpert\u201d advice and protocol, most of which is leading to massive public confusion, some even contradictory in nature.\n\nOne of the hottest areas of debate of late is on the argument of how much \u201cexposure\u201d can be considered safe. I say the word \u201cexposure\u201d blatantly because truth be told, everyone lives their lives everyday with a certain level of exposure risk depending on how they operate. There is no such thing as one hundred percent protection, even if you wash your house down with antiseptic and wear hazmat suits to commute \u2014 the odd chance of coming into contact with viral particles looms wherever you go. Exposure is all around us and therefore an inevitable part of pandemic life. Each exposure strata comes with their own unintended consequences, as we\u2019ll explore in the following paragraphs.\n\nThis sizzling discourse on the topic of \u201cexposure\u201d is based on the understanding that the world\u2019s economy rotates around the pre-pandemic lifestyle, where humans bustle down crowded theme parks, commute like sardines in a can, and crowd nightclubs and bars like elephant seals during the winter. Returning to what we considered normal would dramatically improve the world\u2019s economy and quality of life, especially in low-income nations and poverty-stricken communities, where recession is synonymous to the idea of doomsday. The obvious downside to this is seeing the risk of exposure skyrocket, taking the number of cases up with it.\n\nOn the flip side, relinquishing the pre-pandemic lifestyle (i.e working from home) would certainly slow down the turning of our global economy\u2019s wheels \u2014 at least until we figure out a way to get around this quandary \u2014 but it would also significantly reduce the risk of exposure and hence curb the spread of SARS-CoV2.\n\nMost people tend to resonate with the latter, since it buys time for researchers to push more effort for prevention methods (i.e vaccinations), but there is a growing herd of desperate radicals willing to surrender safety and give option 1 a trial run. They argue that if herd immunity is what humanity is aiming for, shouldn\u2019t they just get it over with quickly and expose themselves to the virus now \u2014 like parents traditionally would with chickenpox parties?\n\nWhile some healthcare experts agree in the basic logic and potential appeal of the idea, based on the disease pattern that we have observed within the year, it\u2019s a bad idea for two main reasons, you could kill yourself or your loved ones, and you could overwhelm the healthcare system.\n\nFellow physician Dr. Keith Armitage, who specialises in infectious diseases, said the number of deaths in the US would be exponentially higher if more people took this approach. It\u2019s true that the percentage of people who die would be comparatively low (~1%), but the United States has nearly 330 million people. One percent of 330 million is 3.3 million. \u201cI think to get to 80 percent herd immunity could lead to more than a million deaths in the United States,\u201d Armitage said.\n\nTo further supplement the counterargument for this viewpoint is that scientists are still not sure how long the antibodies acquired through infection will last. There has been a body of largely contradicting evidence on this, after following patients who were exposed to SARS-CoV2 and have recovered, checking in regularly to test for the antibody levels in their system. An early study showed that immunoglobulin levels declined rapidly after weeks, another one demonstrated the decline later at 3\u20134 months. These findings show that reinfection after contracting Covid-19 is possible, even though other experts argue however that the mechanism behind antibody preservation may be more complex than that, reflecting a less dire reality.\n\nPaediatrician Dr. Amy Edwards says that efforts to manage the pandemic has never been about stopping Coronavirus. It\u2019s a wave we will all eventually ride out. \u201cThis was never about stopping coronavirus\u201d, she says, \u201cwhat this was about was making sure we had enough hospital capacity to keep coronavirus from overwhelming us.\u201d\n\nAnd this premise led to the birth of potentially harmful advice that if practiced under misguided interpretation, can lead to damaging repercussions. 3 words: Stay. At. Home.\n\nStaying at home is not bad advice, in fact, it\u2019s necessary to curb infection rates. It is, however, riddled with associations \u2014 such as long days in bed or in front of screens \u2014 that can actually prove detrimental to health.\n\nHouses with poor ventilation can actually serve as fertile breeding grounds for respiratory infections, if not those caused by the novel Coronavirus, then by other offending pathogens such as bacteria and fungi \u2014 pathogens we know are easily killed under sunlight and adequate ventilation. The worst-case scenario is having a Covid-19 infection on top of a bacterial focus already brewing in your lungs \u2014 something called a superinfection \u2014 which can dramatically decrease your survival odds.\n\nStaying at home does not always mean staying indoors, but that\u2019s how I think the general public mostly perceives it. This is particularly true for apartment and flat residents, who find it a constant challenge to place themselves in an open area sans the fear of bumping into someone else. Sunlight exposure is absolutely vital in our fight against the Coronavirus. A handful of journals and research papers, including those published before the advent of Covid-19 have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory potential of sun-acquired vitamin D.\n\nVitamin D can be fortified in food sources or be activated in our body with the aid of UV light from the sun and works in a myriad of ways within the human body. Vitamin D helps regulate multiple organ functions on a cellular level, such as maintaining bone health, supplementing macronutrient absorption, and modulating the immune system.\n\nA 2012 paper demonstrated that vitamin D can modulate the innate and adaptive immune response by synthesizing active metabolites that can aid in cellular signaling function after researchers discovered vitamin D receptors being expressed on the surface of immune cells.\n\nIn addition to immune system modulation, deficiency in vitamin D has also been observed in patients with depression. Scientists have yet to pinpoint the exact causality, but it is thought to be a combination of vitamin D\u2019s direct effects, sunlight exposure, age, and a well-balanced diet \u2014 all of which can alter the levels of vitamin D in our body and affect mood as well. But behind all the uncertainty, Medscape argues that vitamin D may be low-hanging fruit in managing this pandemic. While you shouldn\u2019t mindlessly load up with vitamin D, 10\u201330 minutes of morning sunlight exposure and a good diet is generally a good practice to ensure adequate levels in your body.\n\nStaying at home can also encourage a sedentary lifestyle, which isn\u2019t good for you on so many levels. Mindful exercise does not only lead to improved immune system functioning, it also regulates the cardiovascular system and prevents dangerous clots from clogging up your arteries, especially if you have a pre-existing health condition such as hypertension. It is therefore just as crucial for you to pay attention to your physical activity during the pandemic.\n\nResearch has proven time and time again that regular exercise improves general health (including your immune system) and mood. It\u2019s important to stay active during times like these, and unless you\u2019re one of those folks living in a mansion with an indoor gym, it\u2019s difficult to consistently get a good workout in at home. WHO recommends exercising outside to rake in the additional benefits from sunlight and fresh air, and even advocates a no-mask policy during outdoor exercise so long as physical distancing is practiced.\n\nStaying at home can also indirectly encourage longer screen times, which can be detrimental for long-term eye health, especially in children. Optometrist Jonathan Andrews says that \u201cprolonged near work and decreased outdoor activities can increase myopic progression in children.\u201d\n\nFellow optometrist Glenn Steele sustains a similar opinion. \u201cFor an adult with eye strain, we will most of the time get up and move around. Children will push on through that,\u201d Steele said. \u201cNow with the pandemic, all kids have for communication is through screens. I think there are things beyond eye strain that we have to watch out for, one of which is helping kids regulate when do they take breaks. It\u2019s important for parents to help kids learn to take breaks for the future of their vision.\u201d\n\nBut added screen time does not just pose risks against eye strain and myopia, blue and violet light emitted from most modern gadgets can alter Circadian rhythms and disrupt sleep, which is when our body recuperates and does the lion\u2019s share of cellular and tissue repair.\n\nSteele advices taking frequent breaks when viewing screens (20 seconds for every 20 minutes), ensure appropriate distancing (1 feet for mobile devices, 2 feet for laptops, and 10 feet for TVs), designating curfew for screen use, and encouraging physical activity and time spent outdoors.\n\nSpending a portion of your day outside of the home can actually provide benefits that bound better than staying within the confines of your living room \u2014 a message I\u2019m hoping to deliver to the most radical and hardcore stay-at-home advocates.

        "title": "Is 2019 the year of the inventor?",
        "text": "In 2019, it\u2019s tempting to think that civilisation\u2019s ability to create something new has long since peaked. From aeroplanes to the World Wide Web, electric cars to chess-playing AI, the once unimaginable is now taken for granted.\n\nIsaac Newton said that his discoveries were only made possible because he was \u201cstanding on the shoulders of giants\u201d. It is easy to think that the great minds of the Enlightenment and Victorian eras, who gave the world electric motors, lightbulbs, and antibiotics, really did invent everything.\n\nHow much inventing is there really left to do? The answer is: lots \u2014 according to the data.\n\nInventor Thomas Edison, who lived from 1847\u20131931, is famous for holding over a thousand utility patents filed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). But, in 2015, Lowell Wood, a relatively unknown American inventor surpassed Edison\u2019s achievement when he personally filed 1,085 patents, and Wood\u2019s list of inventions is still growing fast.\n\nThe total percentage of granted patents over time | Infographic by Catalogtree\n\nJust looking at the overall number of patented inventions \u2014 the past actually generated far fewer than we might assume. Records reveal that between 1852 and 1915, the UK\u2019s Intellectual Property Office granted approximately 486,000 patents, averaging about 7,700 per year. Between 1916 and 2013, however, the agency granted 2 million patents \u2014 roughly 21,000 per year. As this number has grown still further, 2018 might be the best time to be an inventor, anywhere, ever.\n\nData collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows that just two years ago, inventors around the globe filed a record-breaking 3.1 million patent applications, up 8.3% from the year prior. And more patents are passing the grade than ever before, too. In 2016, 1.35 million patents were granted, compared to 755,200 a decade earlier.\n\nWhile men continue to design the majority of most of the objects and technologies that become patents, WIPO reports that female inventors are on the rise. In 2017, for example, women were listed on nearly one in three international patent applications. Ten years prior, that rate was less than one in four.\n\nThe breakdown of IP applications by category | Infographic by Catalogtree\n\nAnd then there\u2019s social media. If you have an idea today, showing it to your potential customers has never been easier. At present, 2.2 billion people visit Facebook each month, while one billion hours of video are viewed on YouTube every day. Furthermore, in less than a decade, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter has raised $3.9 billion for various ideas and plans. In the same timeframe, contributors have successfully funded more than 7,000 technology campaigns and over 12,151 design projects.\n\nFinally, in an attempt to boost productivity and spur the economy, an increasing number of governments are offering tax incentives to companies willing to invest in research and development. In the UK, for instance, HM Revenue & Customs statistics show that the amount of funds given to businesses both big and small has increased virtually every year since they launched their R&D tax credit program in 2000\u201301. In total, companies have made over 240,000 claims, amounting to \u00a321.4 billion in tax relief.\n\nIn short, if you want to invent something new, there\u2019s never been a better time than now.",

        "text": "The Best Asset Your Startup Can Invest In Right Now\n\nWhere should you be putting your time and money to see 10x+ ROI?\n\nPhoto by Jed Villejo\n\nAs startup founders, we juggle with a lot of different ideas when it comes to determining which investment is best for the business. Is it a software? A hire? A strategy play?\n\nWhat kind of investment can you make now that will slowly compound into long-lasting benefits later on?\n\nIf you\u2019re a budding startup, the best investment your business can make right now isn\u2019t a Chief Marketing Officer or an expensive digital advertising campaign. It isn\u2019t a new storefront or a nicer website either.\n\nYour Startup\u2019s Best Asset\n\nThere\u2019s an asset out there that will:\n\nProtect your business from major losses during economic downturns.\n\nCreate a consistent, steady stream of income for your business.\n\nCompound in effectiveness and size over time.\n\nHelp you save money in marketing and sales costs over the long-term.\n\nThis asset doesn\u2019t need to have a price tag on it and can be acquired in exchange for time. It isn\u2019t something that requires fancy tools or an expert hire, just consistency and commitment.\n\nThis asset is community.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about superficial numbers in your email list or your Twitter followers, I\u2019m talking about real community where you talk with your audience and they talk with each other.\n\nA community that has a shared purpose of helping womxn entrepreneurs overcome their biggest challenges, or shared values like only buying eco-conscious beauty products.\n\nShared purpose and values help people find a go-to place, a home that they can continuously visit to activate their deepest desires. If you can create that home for your audience, you\u2019ve figured out how to anchor people to your business.\n\nThis anchoring creates a magnetism to your business that\u2019s effortless. Through this magnetism, you\u2019ll be able to naturally build a fan base that\u2019ll buy whatever you release and you\u2019ll benefit from a steady stream of income because you have a community that\u2019s constantly talking about you.\n\nCommunity is kind of like having your own QVC show that\u2019s streaming 24/7 \u2014 even though the hosts are talking about random things here and there, they\u2019re still socializing in your home and always bringing the attention back to you and what you\u2019ve got to sell.\n\nOver time, your community\u2019s commitment to your brand will result in marketing and sales cost savings for your business (because you now no longer have to spend money on aggressive lead generation). You\u2019ll start reaping the benefits of organic growth (aka $0 marketing) through referrals via your most loyal customers who have nothing but great things to say about you.\n\nBuilding A Community 101\n\nCommunity is the best investment any small business owner can make in their business right now, and it\u2019s easy to get started. Here are three starting steps to embark on your build.\n\n1. Mission with an excitable response\n\nTo start building a community for your business, start off with a shared purpose or value system, and make sure it\u2019s potent. The test of a potent purpose or value system is by measuring how many people it moves \u2014 when presented to your people, your mission should get an excitable response.\n\nMissions that provoke excitable responses are very seldom neutral, they\u2019re usually very opinionated and divisive.\n\n2. Build a home\n\nFind a place that your community can call home. Is it on your Instagram page? A Facebook page? A community space you\u2019ve created outside of a social platform?\n\nWherever this home is, consistently show up in this space and make it known that this is where you share your deepest, richest conversations and where your community can do the same.\n\nThis home shouldn\u2019t be a place for surface-level conversations that anyone can find on the first page of a Google search result \u2014 this space should be where you\u2019re able to express opinions that feel uniquely yours, and not like copy written by a marketing consultant.\n\n3. Stoke the fire\n\nWithin this home, you have to spend time stoking the fire, especially in the beginning. Ask prompt questions, and always start deeper conversations with those who comment on your posts. You have to act like that person at the party who\u2019s always starting a conversation and bringing life to it.\n\nStoking the fire requires thoughtful responses \u2014 no emojis or one-word responses. A one-word response would be awkward if you were to drop them during a conversation, you should feel the same way when interacting with your community online.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got the swing of things, you\u2019ll be stoking the fire for a while before you see other people in your community stoking the fire with you. You\u2019ll start to see other people in your community coming in hot with conversation-starters and fostering connection once the community has truly taken off.\n\nOnce your community hits this traction, this is when you\u2019ll start seeing payouts from the asset you\u2019ve built. You\u2019ll see the payout in the form of solid numbers \u2014 sales, audience size, conversion %s, all of it.",

        "text": "The internet is the hive mind that can make a better society happen if we unite in pushing back against the diktat of greed that keeps churning out overwrought pathos for clicks and bucks. But until thinking out loud in print gains critical mass, we have to accept it will take a while for our intellectual labor to yield results, be they financial or otherwise.\n\nFor now, we are sowing the seeds for a new ecosystem instead of depleting the current one for our own personal gain. Trust that the present we are writing up now will be the future; greed will eventually become obsolete when it realizes it may have amassed financial wealth but credibility, respect, or usefulness remain beyond its reach.\n\nWe are laying down the blueprints for a better humanity by gently waking one another up from egocentric darkness. And the sooner we do, the better for everyone; we are learning how to be better, together. When we approach writing as service, we break down barriers, torpedo taboos, and slay stigma but doing so takes time and it is a team effort. If bringing us together is what the internet excels at, it only happens when we share our personal narratives with integrity, humility, and most of all accountability.\n\nPeddling shockers to line our pockets with the proceeds of sensationalism by parlaying outrage, shock, or disgust into cash as we settle old scores is a zero-sum game, no matter how much it pays: it offers no societal value so it achieves nothing beyond temporary personal enrichment.\n\nSurprisingly perhaps in such an individualistic culture as ours, it is by putting others first that we lead change. Those who get to carry the torch have first dibs on what the future looks like and that is priceless: This is how writing online can change our lives, from journalism to social media.\n\nWe get to shape the world we want to live in through the strength of our words.\n\nThink about it, isn\u2019t this extraordinary?",

        "title": "Substack vs Medium",
        "text": "Substack vs. Medium In Depth Comparison\n\nWhile the infographic above helps quickly differentiate between the two platforms, it does not discuss the various subtleties and nuances which writers may be interested in when committing significant time and resources to a single platform. The content below offers an in depth comparison of the two platforms.\n\nPlatform Purpose and Intended Function\n\nMedium:\n\nMedium was created by Ev Williams, previously co-founder of Blogger and Twitter. He initially developed Medium as a way to publish writings and documents longer than Twitter\u2019s 140-character (now 280-character) maximum. Basically a long-form version of Twitter that would encourage more substantive discourse. In 2017, Medium introduced its Partner Program which was implemented to help persuade writers to put their content behind Medium\u2019s metered paywall. All of this is part of a larger attempt to make Medium a central hub of content, regardless if it is written by little known writers or by staff at one of Medium's in house publications.\n\nSubstack:\n\nA Substack publication is an email newsletter that you can charge money for. You write it, readers pay you. Substack\u2019s focus is on helping Substack writers maximize their earning potential under this model.\n\nTo help writers, Substack offers the following tools (for free) to all accounts:\n\nA content management system that has been purpose-built for publishing paid newsletters.\n\nConnection to a Stripe account to manage payments and receive money in your bank account.\n\nA website built with mobile in mind that looks great and loads fast on any device and in any browser.\n\nAnalytics that show your email open rates, website pageviews, and subscriber counts.\n\nAccess to a growing knowledge database of best practices for running a paid newsletter business.\n\nPlatform Business Model\n\nMedium:\n\nMedium makes money by charging readers $5 per month (or $50 per year) to access its content, which is hosted behind a metered paywall. In the past, Medium had attempted to monetize content by allowing publications to charge subscriptions (similar to the current Substack model) but it has since pivoted away from this model.\n\nMedium\u2019s paywall is unique in that it is metered and not a firm paywall. Readers can read 3 articles per month, even if they are not paying subscribers. This is an important part of the Medium marketing strategy, as it entices regular readers to become subscribers.\n\nThis method is successfully used by Medium, but not many other digital media companies, because Medium has amassed a tremendous audience and they continue to build this audience through their high domain authority.\n\nFor example, if I Google:\n\nguerilla marketing tactics\n\nThe first result (which is actually a Google featured snippet), is an article I published on Medium, 10 Creative Guerilla Marketing Tactics to Boost Your Brand, Company, or Cause.\n\nHad I posted this on my own blog or any other site with lower Domain Authority, this article would have likely been buried 5+ pages deep in the Google search results.\n\nThis obviously encourages me to use Medium, but it also serves as a gateway for people who have never heard of Medium, to look into the platform. This is essential to Medium building their subscriber base.\n\nSubstack:\n\nPublishing on Substack is completely free, if you choose to not charge for your content. Once you start charging, they take a 10% fee on top of credit card fees, from all of your paid subscriptions.\n\nOn one hand this is a good model because it aligns incentives for both publishers and writers \u2014 Substack writers must succeed in order for Substack the company to succeed.\n\nThat said, Substack\u2019s fees do add up and are something worth considering if you have a large and engaged fan base.\n\nIf you are able to set up your own email marketing funnel and promote your content effectively, you may be able to earn more on Medium.\n\nSubstack\u2019s business model relies partially upon writers utilizing the WYSIWYG tools effectively, to reach new readers, and develop a fanbase.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Substack gives you direct access to customer subscription info (emails), meaning you could theoretically walk away from the platform at some point in the future. On Medium, you do not receive reader contact info, establishing a heavier dependence on the platform and some loss of autonomy.\n\nSuccessful User Profile\n\nMedium:\n\nIt is hard to define the \u201cprofile\u201d of the typical successful Medium writer because Medium only releases very limited earnings information.\n\nBut based on my research into top writers, generally speaking, are those who can create semi-viral content. This is largely due to the Medium writer compensation system which rewards writers financially, only for the engagement of paying readers. So in order to make significant money on Medium you must be able to draw in readers who are a part of the Medium platform itself.\n\nThere are definitely exceptions to this, but the above characterization cover probably 85%+ of top earning Medium writers.\n\nTop Medium writers (much like Substack), do generally need to develop a niche, but the niche needs to be a semi popular niche that exists on Medium. Some examples of these niches are:\n\nPersonal development\n\nTechnology\n\nProgramming\n\nMarketing\n\nGender and Social Issues\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nSelf-Help\n\nProductivity\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nNotice that while these are considered \u201cniches\u201d within the Medium platform, these categories are still fairly broad and would not necessarily constitute a \u201cniche\u201d when writing on Substack.\n\nSubstack:\n\nSuccessful Substack writers typically write about a very specific niche and are sometimes quasi-subject matter experts on a topic.\n\nTake Bill Bishop. One of Substack\u2019s most successful newsletters is Sinocism. The Sinocism China Newsletter is an email newsletter written by Bill Bishop that helps readers better understand China.\n\nSinocism offers content promising to \u201cmake you smarter about China.\u201d The newsletter is considered a must read by diplomats, policymakers, investors, executives, journalists, and academics who want to better understand China and get regular commentary on Chinese and English language news.\n\nBefore writing Sinocism, Bill Bishop was a media executive with more than a decade\u2019s experience living in and decoding China. He previously wrote the Axios China weekly newsletter and the China Insider column for the New York Times Dealbook.\n\nWhile you do not need to be an industry veteran to publish a newsletter on a topic, obviously it goes a long way toward establishing credibility on a certain subject.\n\nSubstack publications can consist of an even smaller niche. JoeBlogs is a popular blog focusing on baseball.\n\nThis type of publication works well on Substack because it unites true baseball fans around a hyper specific topic.\n\nIn contrast, it would be hard to run a successful sports publication on Medium, covering many sports. A baseball specific publication on Medium might generate some traffic due to Medium's high Domain authority but unless their is a mass appeal to Medium's paying readers, it is unlikely to generate many views from the readers whose views actually count toward Partner Program earnings (paying readers).\n\nWriter Monetization Methods\n\nNote: both platforms rely upon Stripe for writer payments, meaning that from a global perspective, if you are not in a country supported by stripe, neither of these are currently an option. Both seem to have formed exclusive relationships with Stripe:\n\nMedium:\n\nSubstack:\n\nMedium:\n\nMedium has a clear monetization method, that can be easily used by any writer \u2014 The Medium Partner Program.\n\nThe Medium Partner Program is Medium\u2019s program that allows writers to earn money from articles they submit.\n\nThe Medium Partner Program is open to anyone, and it even allows the re-posting of content first posted on other platforms (such as a blog post on your self-hosted blog).\n\nMedium pays writers based on Member Reading Time \u2014 which is a measure of the total time paying subscribers spend reading your articles.\n\nAs Medium described in their post on the earnings update:\n\nAs a user reads, we measure their scrolls and take care to differentiate between short pauses (like lingering over a particularly great passage) and longer breaks (like stepping away to grab a cup of coffee). Reading time incorporates signal from your readers without hurdles. You don\u2019t need to ask your readers to remember to clap, or click, or do anything other than read.\n\nThis process can feel a bit opaque because Medium is (theoretically) dividing up some pot of money based on subscriptions and distributing it to writers based on several propriety factors.\n\nBut the Medium Partner Program has proven itself to be a reliable stream of income for thousands of writers (myself included).\n\nWhile many successful Medium writers promote their stories on social media or through their mailing lists, many focus their attention on writing and rely upon Medium\u2019s large built in audience and the platform\u2019s content discovery tools to drive traffic.\n\nThis combination has made Medium a popular choice among writers who want exposure while still being compensated for their effort.\n\nMedium is 100% free for writers.\n\nSubstack:\n\nSubstack is similar to Medium in that anyone can set up a subscription newsletter easily using Substack\u2019s free tools.\n\nHowever, it is different in several ways, when it comes to how writer\u2019s are compensated.\n\nSubstack offers little in the way of content discovery or assistance driving traffic. Rather, they focus on providing a more complex suite of tools then Medium, but then the writer is responsible for driving traffic/subscribers to their newsletter.\n\nSubstack gives writers:\n\nA free Substack domain/website\n\nA landing page, which can collect emails of potential subscribers or process the payments of readers ready to subscribe\n\nAn email marketing system which allows writer to simultaneously post content to their blog and to send readers on their email lists preformatted emails containing their posts.\n\nThis third point is the main difference between Medium and Substack.\n\nAs a writer on Medium, you do not have direct access to your readers\u2019 emails. You instead rely upon Medium's curation system and content distribution system to feature you work among willing readers.\n\nMany writers on Medium get around this by using an email marketing system (such as Mailchimp) and they insert a CTA or sign up form at the end of their articles. This functions as a hedge against being disconnected from their readers if the author decides to leave Medium or if Medium (right or wrong) decides to suspend their account.\n\nSubstack essentially cuts out the middleman. You do not need a separate email marketing sytem with Substack since al your posts are already sent to your subscribers.\n\nEmail marketing systems typically increase in price as your email list grows, so this can become a large cost for many writers on Medium. Substack currently offers this same functionality essentially for free.\n\nSubstack also lets writer\u2019s determine the price they charge subscribers for access to their newsletter. Many writers feel they are not adequately compensated for their writing, and Substack allows them to charge whatever they want to a core group of subscribers.\n\nSubstack does have monthly minimums that author scan charge ($5 per month or $30 per year) but these threshold are generally below or at what most writers would charge for their work anyway. If you really want to charge less, you can use the promotion code hack and set an indefinite discount. For example, a 50% discount off of a $5 per month/ $30 per year plan would only cost $2.50 per month or $15 per year. I currently am running this exact promotion on my Blogging Guide newsletter:\n\nContent Discovery\n\nMedium:\n\nOne of the few advantages that Medium has over Substack is its robust content discovery tools. In other words, readers come to Medium for reading material, they use the search function or read content recommended to them based on their interests.\n\nSubstack:\n\nSubstack does not have a content discovery tool (or at least not yet). They do have a leader board page which displays top posts and newsletters, both paid and free:\n\nPlatform Tools\n\nMedium:\n\nBoth Medium and Substack make it easy to create stylish and professional looking posts:\n\nThey also both have fantastic article editors:\n\nMedium:\n\nSubstack:\n\nHowever, Medium does allow for better organization of articles with their publication tool, which includes features like feature pages which can be prominently displayed at the top navigation bar of your publication:\n\nSubstack:\n\nIn general Substack offers writers more tools than Medium.\n\nAs previosuly mentioned, the built in email marketing function is probably the most useful. This ability to automatically email your readers is not only cost effective, but the data analytics are quite useful.\n\nYou can see how an email performed in terms of how many recipients it reached, how many opened it, and how many of those readers subscribed:\n\nYou can also see a breakdown of all the links clicked in your newsletter \u2014 a feature of most email marketing systems which Medium noticeably lacks:\n\nThis an extremely valuable feature. For those familiar with my analysis of Medium data analytics, Substack\u2019s data analytics may appear a bit more sparse than Medium\u2019s. But Substack\u2019s data analytics includes conversion rates, which from a content creator\u2019s perspective, is of the utmost importance.\n\nIf you want to see the activity of an individual subscriber (free or paid), click on the \u201cSubscribers\u201d button in the upper right hand corner of the page:\n\nIf you scroll down the page, you will see a list of your email subscribers:\n\nIf you click on a specific email, you can see the detailed activity of each subscriber:\n\nFor example, in the screenshot above, you can see that the user:\n\n\u2014 First signed up for Medium Blogging Guide on March 11th. \u2014 Next, they received an email with my post on March 13th (Gumroad & Medium). \u2014 A few days later, they received another email, on March 16th (Platforms to Write on Besides Medium) They opened first email twice on March 17th (Gumroad & Medium). They upgraded to become a paid subscriber on March 21st\n\nSubstack\u2019s subscriber-specific analytics provide enormous insight into the patterns of your subscribers.\n\nYou can use this data to:\n\nDetermine what posts lead to a higher subscriber sign up rate\n\nSee whether a specific user opened your latest email\n\nEstablish the proper ratio of free to paid content in order to optimize paying subscribers\n\nConclusion\n\nMedium and Substack are both amazing free tools, and there is no reason you have to use just one of them.\n\nThe platforms broadly serve the same purpose (to help writers connect with an audience and make money from their content), and their differentiating factors, largely are indicative of their different functions (Medium \u2014 easy blogging, Substack \u2014 easy subscription newsletter).\n\nIf you were to choose between the two platforms, I would suggest you pick based on the following questions:\n\nHow much time do you plan to invest? \u2014 if you are looking to make money by writing the occasional article (1\u20132 articles per month), Medium may be the better platform. Substack subscribers generally expect several high quality/useful posts per week. Note : even though Medium may be the better platform in this scenario, that does not mean it is ideal to post once or twice per month on Medium. In order for most new writers to be successful, they should also publish a few times per week. On the other end of the spectrum if you are a prolific writer cranking out 2\u20133 posts per day, Medium may be the best option since there is a larger audience, and each post increases tour general reach on Medium by expanding your fan base. Substack subscribers might actually get annoyed with multiple posts per day, as you are flooding their inbox with direct emails.\n\n\u2014 if you are looking to make money by writing the occasional article (1\u20132 articles per month), Medium may be the better platform.

        "text": "Creating Data Lake & Discovering Your Data Using AWS Lake Formation Capabilities Adit Modi Follow Oct 16 \u00b7 9 min read\n\n[Article 2 of 6 in series Big Data Applications on AWS]\n\nPrevious Article in the Series\n\nAWS Lake Formation makes it easy for you to set up, secure, and manage your data lakes also data discovery using the metadata search capabilities of Lake Formation in the console, and metadata search results restricted by column permissions.\n\nMy Background: Cloud and Big Data Enthusiast | 4x AWS Certified | 3x Oracle Cloud Certified | 3x Azure Certified | Big Data Certified.\n\nData lakes are an increasingly popular way to create a single repository to store and analyze both structured and unstructured data. AWS Lake Formation makes it easy for you to set up, secure, and manage data lakes. This Article walks you through the creation and exploration of a data lake using Lake Formation:\n\nCreating the data lake\n\no Adding data to your data lake\n\no Creating catalog databases\n\no Adding tables from Amazon S3 to catalog databases\n\nEditing and adding metadata within the catalog\n\no Editing standard metadata\n\no Adding custom metadata\n\nSteps\n\nCreate the data lake\n\nIn the AWS Lake Formation console, in the left navigation pane, choose Register and ingest, Data lake locations. Select a single S3 bucket to house several independent data sources in your data lake.\n\nAdd data to your data lake\n\nNow that you have an S3 bucket configured as a storage resource for Lake Formation, you must add data to your data lake. You can add data to your data lake\u2019s S3 bucket storage resource using AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, the S3 console, or a Lake Formation blueprint.\n\nWith Lake Formation, you can discover and set up the ingestion of your source data. When you add a workflow that loads or updates the data lake, you can choose a blueprint or template of the type of importer to add. Lake Formation provides several blueprints on the Lake Formation console for common source data types to simplify the creation of workflows. Workflows point to your data source and target and specify the frequency that they run.\n\nSample Datasets are provided as follows\n\nNew York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data Amazon Customer Reviews\n\nAdd Amazon customer reviews to your data lake\n\nAWS hosts a registry to help people share and discover a variety of datasets. For this post, copy a subset of the Amazon customer reviews dataset into your data lake. You don\u2019t have to copy the complete reviews dataset, only the smaller 226-MB portion of watch reviews. You need two copies of this data in your data lake to simulate separate \u201cproduction\u201d and \u201ctest\u201d databases.\n\nIf you have not already, install and configure the AWS CLI with IAM user access keys that include permission to read from S3 and write to your Lake Formation S3 bucket. Copy the source to your data lake:\n\n# Replace with your bucket name: YOUR_BUCKET=lf-metadata-demo aws s3 cp \\ s3://amazon-reviews-pds/parquet/product_category=Watches/ \\ s3://$YOUR_BUCKET/amazon-reviews-prod/amazon-reviews/ --recursive aws s3 cp \\ s3://amazon-reviews-pds/parquet/product_category=Watches/ \\ s3://$YOUR_BUCKET/amazon-reviews-test/amazon-reviews/ --recursive\n\n3. In the S3 console, confirm that your S3 bucket now contains your two Amazon reviews datasets.\n\n4. Inspect the contents of the folders. The datasets are in Parquet format.\n\nAdd New York taxi ride history to your data lake\n\nMuch as you did with the Amazon customer reviews dataset, copy a small subset of New York taxi ride history from the Registry of Open Data on AWS into your data lake:\n\nCopy the source data to your data lake:\n\n# Replace with your bucket name: YOUR_BUCKET=lf-metadata-demo aws s3 cp \"s3://nyc-tlc/trip data/green_tripdata_2018-02.csv\" s3://$YOUR_BUCKET/ny-taxi/trip-data/green_tripdata_2018-02.csv\n\n2. In the S3 console, validate that your S3 bucket contains CSV data for NY taxi trips.\n\nCreate catalog databases\n\nYou have created an S3 bucket to act as your data lake storage backend and added data to the bucket. However, this data is not readily available in Lake Formation until you catalog the data.\n\nLake Formation maintains a Hive-compatible data catalog of data within your data lake. Before you can catalog data within your S3 storage backend or use Lake Formation data importers (discussed later) to push data to S3, you must first create a database.\n\nA Lake Formation database is a logical construct to which you later add tables. Each table contains a mapping to one or more objects in S3 that, collectively, represent that table. Tables also contain basic metadata including but not limited to file format, S3 location, column headings, and column types. Lake Formation users can also optionally define arbitrary key-value pairs for tables and columns to better describe the data and act as query-able attributes for data discovery.\n\nYou can create one or more databases and populate their tables either manually in the console, programmatically using the AWS SDKs or AWS CLI, or automatically by defining AWS Glue crawlers.\n\ndefine three logical databases:\n\no amazon-reviews-prod\n\no amazon-reviews-test\n\no ny-taxi\n\nAdd tables from S3 to your catalog databases\n\nyou created three databases in your Lake Formation catalog. However, these catalog databases are empty and do not yet provide information about the specific tables, schema, file formats, or object paths in S3. To add this information, use one of the following two methods:\n\nManually define your tables in the catalog using the console, SDKs, or AWS CLI.\n\nUse an AWS Glue crawler to search S3 and automatically add discovered tables to your catalog.\n\nFor this article, create and manually run one AWS Glue crawler for each of your three datasets in S3 and databases in the Lake Formation data catalog. A detailed walkthrough is outside the scope of this Article. For guidance, see Working with Crawlers on the AWS Glue Console.\n\nAs you proceed, please bear the following in mind:\n\nCreate one crawler for each of your three datasets. You should be able to accept most of the default crawler settings. However, the S3 path for your crawlers should read:\n\no s3://YOUR_BUCKET/amazon-reviews-prod/amazon-reviews\n\no s3://YOUR_BUCKET/amazon-reviews-test/amazon-reviews\n\no s3://YOUR_BUCKET/ny-taxi/trip-data\n\nBefore you run the crawlers to populate your catalog, you must assign them an IAM role. The role grants them permission to read from your data lake\u2019s S3 bucket, write crawler logs to Amazon CloudWatch, and update your data catalog. Regardless of whether you create a new role, or use an existing role, make a note of the IAM role name. You need this information for the next step.\n\nIn addition to permissions defined within IAM, you must also explicitly grant IAM principals (roles or users) the ability to modify your Data Catalog from within Lake Formation itself. Conceptually, this is similar to the concept of bucket policies in S3 used with IAM. In the Lake Formation console, under Permissions, choose Data permissions.\n\nGrant your AWS Glue crawlers the ability to modify your Data Catalog. Configure the following fields:\n\nFor IAM users and roles, select the IAM roles that you previously used for your AWS Glue crawlers.\n\nFor Database, select the amazon-reviews-prod, amazon-reviews-test, and ny-taxi databases.\n\nFor Database permissions, select all permissions.\n\nLeave all Grantable permissions unselected.\n\nAfter your AWS Glue crawlers have permission to modify your Lake Formation data catalog, return to the AWS Glue console and manually run your three crawlers. After a few minutes, the crawlers should complete their runs. Each should add one table to your data catalog:\n\no amazon-reviews\n\no amazon-reviews\n\no trip-data\n\nMetadata search in the console\n\nSearch by classification Search by keyword Search by tag: attribute Multiple filter searches Metadata search results restricted by column permissions\n\nIn this Article, we demonstrate the catalog search capabilities offered by the Lake Formation console:\n\nSearch by classification\n\nSearch by keyword\n\nSearch by tag: attribute\n\nMultiple filter searches\n\nSearch by classification\n\nUsing the metadata catalog search capabilities, search across all tables within your data lake. Two share the name amazon_reviews but separately belong to your simulated \u201cprod\u201d and \u201ctest\u201d databases, and the third is trip-data.\n\nIn the Lake Formation console, under Data catalog, choose Tables. In the search bar, under Resource Attributes, choose Classification, type CSV, and press Enter. You should see only the trip_data table, which you formatted as CSV in your data lake. The amazon_reviews tables do not appear because they are in Parquet format. In the Name column, choose trip_data. Under Table details, you can see that the classification CSV is correctly identified by the metadata search filter.\n\nSearch by keyword\n\nNext, search across your entire data lake filtering metadata by keyword.\n\nTo refresh the list of tables, under Data catalog, choose Tables again. From the search bar, type star_rating , and press Enter. Now that you have applied the filter, you should see only the amazon_reviews tables because they both contain a column named star_rating. By choosing either of the two tables, you can scroll down to the Schema section, and confirm that they contain a star_rating column.\n\nSearch by tag: attribute\n\nNext, search across your data lake and filter results by metadata tags and their attribute value.\n\nTo refresh the list of tables, under Data catalog, choose Tables. From the search bar, type department:research , and press Enter. Now that you have applied the filter, you should see only the trip_data table because this is the only table containing the value of \u2018research\u2019 in the table property of \u2018department\u2019. Select the trip_data table. Under Table details, you can see the tag: attribute of department | research listed under Table properties.\n\nMultiple filter searches\n\nFinally, try searching across your entire data lake using multiple filters at one time.\n\nTo refresh the list of tables, under Data catalog, choose Tables. In the search bar, choose Location, type S3 , and press Enter. For this post, all of your catalog tables are in S3, so all three tables display. In the search bar, choose Classification, type parquet , and press Enter. You should see only the amazon_reviews tables because they are the only tables stored in S3 in Parquet format. Choose either of the displayed amazon_reviews tables. Under Table details, you can see that the following is true.\n\nLocation: S3\n\nClassification: parquet\n\nMetadata search results restricted by column permissions\n\nThe metadata search capabilities return results based on the permissions specified within Lake Formation. If a user or a role does not have permission to a particular database, table, or column, that element doesn\u2019t appear in that user\u2019s search results.\n\nTo demonstrate this, first create an IAM user, dataResearcher, with AWS Management Console access. Make sure to store the password somewhere safe. Next, create an IAM group with the AWSLakeFormationDataAdmin policy attached. Finally, add the dataResearcher user to this new group. We will use this user below to sign into our account with the group\u2019s limited access.\n\nyou allowed Everyone to view the tables that the AWS Glue crawlers created. Now, revoke those permissions for the ny-taxi database.\n\nIn the Lake Formation console, under Permissions, choose Data permissions. Scroll down or search until you see the Everyone record for the trip_data table. Select the record and choose Revoke, Revoke.\n\nNow, your dataResearcher IAM user cannot see the ny-taxi database or the trip_data table. Resolve this issue by setting up Lake Formation permissions.\n\nUnder Permissions, choose Data Permission, Grant. Select the dataResearcher user, the ny-taxi database, and the trip_data table. Under Table permissions, check Select and choose Grant. Log out of the console and sign back in using the dataResearcher IAM user that you created earlier. In the Lake Formation console, choose Tables, select the trip_data table, and look at its properties:\n\nYou have learned how to use the metadata search capabilities of Lake Formation. By defining specific user permissions, Lake Formation allowed you to grant and revoke access to metadata in the Data Catalog as well as the underlying data stored in S3. Therefore, you can discover your data sources across your entire AWS environment using a single pane of glass.

        "title": "The Down and Dirty on Disposable Diapers",
        "text": "The Down and Dirty on Disposable Diapers\n\nWhere we are, how we got here and is there a good alternative\n\nPhoto by Zelle Duda on Unsplash\n\nDisposable diapers are amazing.\n\nYour child\u2019s waste is contained. You see it for only a few moments (hopefully) and then you close up the diaper. Poof! Gone from your thoughts and into the trash can or Diaper Genie.\n\nThe invention of disposable diapers was a miracle of convenience for parents and it seems that the world has not looked back. No more washing poop from cloth diapers. After all, hasn\u2019t society evolved past cloth diapers?\n\nBut let\u2019s stop and consider the impact of moving to disposable diapers. An average baby uses between eight and twelve diapers per day in the first year. That equates to just over 3,500 diapers for one baby in one year and a total of more than 7,000 through potty training. For one tiny human.\n\nThe numbers are staggering, but is it enough to consider alternatives. Is there even a good alternative? Let\u2019s look at how we got here and what initiatives are cropping up to tackle the solution of diaper waste.\n\nHistory of Disposable Diapers\n\nBefore the 1960s, parents had no choice but to cloth diaper their babies.\n\nProctor and Gamble introduced Pampers in 1961 as the first disposable diaper. After years of tri-folding diapers and securing them using safety pins, mothers and other caretakers had the convenience of disposable diapers. They were suddenly free from the burden of additional wash cycles.\n\nPhoto by Boston Public Library on Unsplash\n\nThe company aggressively advertised its diapers and the brand has become a household name. In Belgium, for example, \u201cpamper\u201d is even synonymous with the Dutch word for diaper. Vintage Pampers commercials from the 1970s are still available online. At the end of one video, a mother who just discovered disposable diapers says:\n\n\u201cOkay, hunny, it looks like you are going to be a happier baby from now on\u2026and I\u2019m going to be a happier mommy.\u201d\n\nWe have come a long way from those first disposables. The technology has advanced significantly. Diapers started to have double gussets for fewer leaks, tabs that could be refastened, and super absorbent polymers. Introduced in 1984, super absorbent polymers can hold many more times their weight in water, meaning a drier baby and fewer diaper changes.\n\nWithout a doubt, diapers are quite an engineering feat. If you have any doubt, watch the short video below.\n\nThe power of a disposable diaper; video by author\n\nAn Explosion of Choice\n\nDiaper choice has exploded. Walmart.com carries 15 different disposable diaper brands, with some of the major brands marketing multiple types of diapers under the same brand. Amazon.com carries additional brands, including a few niche brands, like Honest Company.\n\nWe have also seen the rise of store-brand disposable diapers, which provide a cheap alternative to name brands. It seems that each supermarket and pharmacy chain sells its own white label brand. In the U.S., for example, Aldi sells its store-brand pack of diapers for about 11 cents per diaper. These are a blessing for families just trying to get by or for cost-conscious parents. In my experience, these diapers work just as well as name brands, like Pampers and Luvs, but for full disclosure, my testing of name brands has been very limited.\n\nMany brands have developed premium diapers carrying one or more of the following descriptors: eco-friendly, bio-based, ultra-sensitive, or biodegradable diapers. Some contain natural products (such as bamboo fiber) and most are free from chemical treatment.\n\nBut just because diapers market themselves as eco-friendly, are they better? In theory, these premium diapers make sense environmentally, but in practice, they may not make much of a difference. We will look at these premium diapers later in this article.\n\nAmount of Diapers Used\n\nOn average, children wear diapers for two to three years until they are potty trained, while some children are potty trained even later.\n\nThe first few months are intense for diaper-wearing, with babies going through approximately twelve diapers per day. This number decreases until they only go through only a few diapers while they are being potty trained. Based on these numbers and assuming three years until fully potty trained, one baby can go through over 7,600 diapers.\n\nImage by author\n\nImage by author\n\nCost of Diapers\n\nIf you use store brand diapers, expect to pay approximately $1,300 in diapers for each child. This cost is easily doubled by using name brand diapers and even more with premium/eco-friendly diapers. Parents have to be very committed to an environmental purpose to stomach such a high price tag for biodegradable or ecologically friendly diapers.\n\nImage by author\n\nThe cost per diaper goes up as the baby advances through the different sizes. This makes sense because the diapers get bigger and there is more material involved, like the super absorbent polymers to suck up all that pee.\n\nSometimes the diaper companies and stores get tricky about this. On a website for a local pharmacy chain, I noticed the price tag of \u20ac25 (approximately $27.50) for a pack of diapers. The package price stayed the same for four sizes of diapers, but the amount of diapers in each pack decreases. This is a typical marketing strategy in many industries. It works well in the diaper industry because, by a few months into the baby\u2019s diaper-wearing career, parents usually have a default brand choice when going to a store. Many might not even notice the price going up.\n\nImage by author\n\nEnvironmental Impact of Disposable Diapers\n\nOne-time-use diapers were a boon for women\u2019s liberation and convenience, but almost immediately, they became a significant waste stream. By the 1980s, diapers accounted for 1.4% of all municipal waste put into landfills in the United States. Today, disposable diapers accounted for 2.4% of all municipal waste put in landfills, according to the latest report by the EPA (2017).\n\nTwo percent sounds pretty minimal at first, right? Well, that\u2019s 3.3 million tons of diapers each year. Based on my calculations, if this would only be baby diapers, 20 billion diapers end up in a landfill each year, plus another 4.9 billion diapers burned. Of course, these numbers from the EPA include some adult diapers, but the split is not clear.\n\nThe numbers add up quickly in every household. Remember those 7,600 diapers for each child? That is the volume of 20 bathtubs and the weight of a small-sized car, as shown in the infographic below.\n\nImage by author\n\nIt\u2019s not just the amount of waste that\u2019s concerning. Many people worry about the toxic chemicals and untreated waste released from diapers into the environment as they sit in landfills. However, modern landfills are designed to prevent contamination of groundwater, but this concern is real for diapers that don\u2019t make it into landfills and are littered into nature, being exposed to the elements.\n\nAnother concern is environmental impacts upstream of diaper usage, for the manufacturing of the diapers and their raw materials. Basically, a lot of trees and oil. Trees are used for wood pulp in the diaper, oil is used for the plastics in the diapers and their packaging, and water and energy are consumed in the manufacturing process.\n\nAlternatives to Disposable Diapers\n\nOkay, now that you are officially depressed, let\u2019s talk about what can be done to combat the growing waste of disposable diapers.\n\nThree main alternatives exist to decrease the number of disposable diapers used by a child.\n\n1. Eco-Friendly/Biodegradable Diapers \u2014 Perhaps the most mainstream of the three is choosing to buy eco-friendly diapers that have a higher composition of biodegradable materials. Now, the jury is out on whether these diapers have a huge benefit to the environment. After all, most still end up in a landfill. One thing is clear is that it is a huge hit to your wallet, costing you up to 3x more than buying store brand diapers.\n\nThese diapers are meant to have less of an environmental impact during manufacturing and after disposal, but how much depends on the brand. Some diapers within this category are 100% biodegradable and compostable, but some can be as low as 65% biodegradable and still contain plastic. (By comparison, regular diapers are said to be only 25\u201335% biodegradable.)\n\nThe sad truth is that most parents will just throw these diapers in the trash and then, \u201cbiodegradable\u201d means nothing. If these diapers go in the same waste stream as other diapers \u2014 which most likely will \u2014 they end up in landfills. Starved of much oxygen and sunlight in the landfill, these eco-friendly diapers will most likely take just as long to decompose as basic diapers.\n\nBoth eco-friendly and basic diapers can be composted, in different proportions. So what does this actually mean? If parents separate the inner filling (cellulose and super absorbent polymers) from the plastic, this filler material can be put in a compost pile or bin. Mixed loosely with other compost and soil, the diaper filling can break down within a few months. Only wet/pee diapers should be composted. Poopy diapers shouldn\u2019t be composted because they contain bacteria. Even with only the wet diapers, since this is not an industrial composting process subjected to high heat, the resulting compost should only be used for non-edible purposes (plants, trees, and flowers).\n\nBut since the composting process takes time and effort, most premium diapers will still end up in the same waste stream as other diapers.\n\n2. Cloth Diapers \u2014 Another alternative to disposable diapers is to use cloth diapers for your child. The most common form of modern cloth diapering involves three pieces: a cloth diaper with plastic snaps or Velcro, an absorbent inner liner, and an optional disposable liner. There are also hybrid solutions with a cloth outer layer and a disposable absorbent liner, such as gDiapers.\n\nSome parents also choose to cloth diaper part of the time, still using a disposable diaper during the nights and when traveling. Although still producing diaper waste, using cloth diapers for part of the time can easily cut diaper usage by more than half.\n\n3. Potty train a child early \u2014 This last alternative can either be a strategy of potty training a child a few months earlier or potty training them from a very early age. The latter is called Elimination Communication or Natural Infant Hygiene, which was popularized by Ingrid Bauer in her \u201cDiaper Free\u201d book. And I know most parents are rolling their eyes and sarcastically thinking, good luck potty training early! It is an alternative, though.\n\nIs Diaper Recycling an Alternative?\n\nThere is some light at the end of the tunnel \u2014 diaper recycling. I don\u2019t mention this as one of the alternatives above because it is still in its infant stage.\n\nIn my research, I came across two main diaper reuse projects \u2014 TerraCycle and FaterSMART. TerraCycle is a New Jersey-based recycling company. Partnering with DYPER, a subscription-based diaper service, TerraCycle composts subscribers\u2019 dirty diapers via mail-in boxes. The service only sells bamboo-based, compostable diapers and the finished compost is used for vegetation along highways.\n\nFaterSMART is a joint venture with Procter & Gamble (the company that produces Pampers) and Angelini. It has established a pilot recycling plant in Italy that recycles used absorbent hygiene products, including dirty diapers. The process sanitizes the diapers and recovers plastic, cellulose, and super absorbent polymers.\n\nHowever, diapers don\u2019t get recycled into new diapers. Like most other recycling processes, recycled material can only be used in products of lesser quality, a concept known as \u201cdowncycling.\u201d The recovered super absorbent polymers have less absorbency and the recovered plastic has a lesser quality than the original. In theory, absorbent material from recycled diapers can go into absorbent products for pets (like cat litter and dog pee pads), disposable bed liners, or fiber additives in concrete. The plastic can be mixed with other materials to make plastic wood-like products (park benches and pallets), roof tiles, tubing, and other products.\n\nOther initiatives exist around the world. Amsterdam has twelve diaper recycling bins and the used diapers get sent to the FaterSMART plant in Italy. TinyTots is a San Francisco-based pickup service for compostable diapers. Universities and private companies are experimenting in diaper recycling technology, such as in Taiwan and the Netherlands, but many of these projects have yet to be realized.\n\nGraphic by author; background photo by Louis Hansel on Unsplash\n\nAll of these projects provide a reason for optimism. Companies, governments, and other organizations want to find solutions to diaper waste and are willing to put money into this goal. However, similar initiatives have failed in the past. Canadian-based Knowaste was an early-mover in the industry and operated a diaper recycling plant in the UK and the Netherlands. The company closed these facilities in 2013 and 2007, respectively, for a variety of reasons, including profitability, competition from traditional waste plants, and failure to get plans approved by local governments.\n\nWe still need to hold our breath on whether diaper recycling and composting will become a reality, especially on a broad scale. Three major obstacles need to be solved to make diaper manufacturing mainstream.\n\nLegislation \u2014 In the European Union, and perhaps other places, recycled material from diapers is still classified as a waste product, not as secondary recycled material. The resulting material from diaper recycling is fully sanitized, but the classification still exists. The law would have to change in Europe and still, the social acceptance of products made from recycled diapers may be mixed. Strict regulations over hygiene and health need to be created and enforced. Diaper collection \u2014 For used diapers to be processed, diapers need to be divided into a separate waste stream within households and childcare facilities. Families also need to willingly separate it from their other trash. FaterSMART estimates that more than 15% of Italians have access to a separate waste collection for diapers, but this is an anomaly. A limited amount of diaper recycling bins also exist in Amsterdam, but since no diaper recycling plant exists in the Netherlands, these diapers are transported over 1,000 kilometers (600+ miles) to the FaterSMART facility in Italy to be recycled. Profitability \u2014 This ties into the first two barriers. Plants need to have a willing buyer. Manufacturers need to be willing to buy the secondary raw materials recovered from the recycled dirty diapers. Additionally, the collection of diapers needs to be widespread and in enough volume to supply the recycling/composting facilities. Preferably, the diapers collected should go to local facilities to cut down on the cost of transporting these diapers.\n\nSummary\n\nThe subject of disposable diapers is a tricky subject. Parenting is hard enough and disposables are convenient and the most mainstream route.\n\nDisposable diapers do not fully include all costs for their disposal and ironically, the diapers with the most environmental impact may be the cheapest. It is similar to how fast food or canned food is usually cheaper than buying fresh produce. The market doesn\u2019t price in the full cost of a product, such as disposal costs or adverse environmental effects. The choice is left to the consumer and often, the wallet wins out.\n\nShould everyone switch to eco-friendly disposable diapers? Well, asking parents to pay 2x more for eco-friendly diapers at questionable environmental benefits doesn\u2019t seem to be the answer.\n\nDiaper waste is a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d. We are impacted not only by what we do, but by what others all around the world do. In the thick of parenting, it is difficult to stick to environmental principals when it requires a higher cost or larger time commitment to you, while others choose to use the basic disposable diapers. Why would we do all the effort if we still get the negative environmental effects from everyone else? The only benefit is an intrinsic one \u2014 that you\u2019re doing something good for the environment. But let\u2019s face it, that pat on the back isn\u2019t going to get you any more sleep at night or money in your wallet.\n\nWhy should parents bear the decision of having to save the environment or not? Shouldn\u2019t that be the responsibility of companies that produce the diapers and governments who are trying to reduce overall waste?\n\nWhat I honestly believe is that there has to be more local incentives to either use cloth diapers or buy eco-friendly diapers that will actually be composted or recycled. Municipalities should offer incentives for people to use them. Some municipalities charge based on the amount of waste a family produces, but in many areas, only a flat fee is charged for garbage disposal. We need to creatively think together to decide how families can be incentivized to act greener.\n\nDisposable diapers may take up to 500 years to decompose, so it is without a doubt that the choices we make about which diapers to use stay with us forever.\n\nUnless parents are incentivized to use alternatives, then standard disposable diapers will continue to be the path of least resistance. Especially for sleep-deprived parents just trying to make it through this bumpy road of parenthood.\n\nWhat else can you do?\n\nSupport and encourage local initiatives to investigate diaper collection and recycling/composting\n\nSupport and encourage local projects and financial incentives to use cloth or eco-friendly diapers\n\nUrge lawmakers to enforce diaper companies to carry some of the burden for the recycling and/or disposal of their products (Extended Producer Responsibility)\n\nDo you know of initiatives in other countries or municipalities to recycle diapers or incentivize the use of cloth/eco-friendly diapers? Please let me know in the comments.",

        "text": "INFOGRAPHIC SPECIAL \u2014 VACCINE DEVELOPMENT\n\nHow successful have we been with vaccine development for various pandemics?\n\nComparing the vaccine development timelines since the earlier twentieth century\n\nMajor technological advancements made in the field of Medicine has led to a significant increase in average life expectancy. However, it is a somewhat perplexing fact for many as to why we have not been able to develop a vaccine for diseases like AIDS for 40 years, whereas multiple COVID-19 vaccinations have already been rolled out in record time. No wonder the recently developed vaccines are being closely scrutinized by the experts for their safety & efficacy.\n\nFor comparison purposes, It took approximately 25 years to develop a vaccine for the Spanish Flu which killed between 40\u201350 million people. Similarly, the first Ebola vaccine \u2014 an effort that took 43 years since the discovery of the virus. And we are still waiting for a cure for AIDS and yet we have an answer\n\nPrevious vaccines have saved countless lives \u2014 10 million deaths between 2010 and 2015 alone have been prevented, according to the data from the World Health Organization. And we are hoping the case is the same for COVID-19. The infographic above looks at the timeframes for vaccine development for every pandemic since the turn of the 20th century. It also highlights the major steps involved in the development of individual vaccines.\n\nTalking about COVID-19 vaccines, nearly 7.25 billion doses have been pre-purchased by countries and organizations around the globe \u2014 as many countries scramble to innoculate their populations. The second infographic below highlights that high & middle-income countries have hogged the purchasing process by ordering dosages according to their purchasing power.\n\nWhile the hope is that a global vaccine initiative like the COVAX can bring some equality in the vaccine distribution among high-income and low-income countries, it is going to be a long road ahead towards pre-COVID normalcy. In the meantime, here is the link for the COVID-19 vaccine tracker, if you want to follow the development process for various endeavors being undertaken right now.\n\nImage Credit: Visual Capitalist\n\nStay informed with the content that matters \u2014 Join my mailing list",

        "title": "Big data, AI, and Space exploration",
        "text": "Space is huge. Some even believe it could be infinite. Since space is so huge, studying it produces a massive amount of data. Big data and AI is coming together to help answer some of the greatest unanswered questions in cosmology and space exploration.\n\nThe role of AI in space exploration is becoming increasingly vital. Recently a group of physicists, mathematicians, data scientists, and engineers was formed to take the first ever picture of the supermassive black hole, and machine learning plays an important role in the project.\n\nSupermassive Black Hole\n\nA supermassive black hole appears to inhabit the center of the Milky Way galaxy, about 25,000 light-years away. Black holes suck in light, which makes them invisible. They can only be observed by looking for their immense gravitational pull. This pull produces a ring-like structure around the black hole. As the light approaches the event horizon of a black hole, the point beyond which it cannot escape, it bends and stretches. But the ring is very small, and due to diffraction, there are fundamental limits to the smallest objects that can be observed. This means in order to see smaller and smaller cosmic objects, telescopes need to get bigger and bigger. To view the event horizon around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy a telescope the size of the earth would need to be built. That, of course, is impossible.\n\nHowever, there is a way in which this limitation can be overcome. The alternative solution is to connect telescopes from around the world, in an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The EHT creates joins together telescopes and so creates a virtual telescope array the size of the earth. This is capable of seeing structures on the scale of a black holes event horizon.\n\nDr. Katie Bouman, Ph.D., from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT is one of the members of the Massachusetts-based group. Her role in the endeavor is pivotal. Each telescope in the worldwide network works together, linked by the precise timing of atomic clocks. Teams of researchers at each of the sight collect thousands of terabytes of data. This data is then processed in a lab in Massachusetts.\n\nSo how exactly does machine learning aid this project? Individual telescopes receive only a part of the light from the ring wrapped around the event horizon. This photo misses many parts of the image. By using a deep learning algorithm the missing parts of the image are constructed.\n\nAnimated image of a black hole\n\nAIs Exploring Mars\n\nRovers on Mars are using investigating whether the red planet once harbored life and if it could support a human colony. They cannot be controlled by a human operator since it takes between three and twenty minutes for a signal to reach Mars. So if the rover ready to drive off a cliff, it would to too late to send the signal. Rovers have to be able to operate autonomously, and this requires some type of intelligence.\n\nMany companies, like Spire, SpaceKnow, Planet Labs, DigitalGlobe, and SpaceX are making millions of dollars from selling data from satellite observations and imagery. There are many potential applications of earth observation data. Monitoring weather, agricultural purposes, measuring gravitational differences across various land formations, and calculating the concentration of the different elements in specific areas, among others. A learning algorithm must manipulate a huge amount of data if all these potential applications are going to become reality.\n\nCuriosity Rover in mars\n\nThe Future of the Space Industry\n\nCompanies are willing to pay a lot for this kind of information. This data would be useful in a large number of sectors such as hydrocarbons, agriculture, mining, humanitarian, shipping, security, and national security. However, the raw data is complex and often mind-boggling to a human, and it has to be wrapped up and presented in a way so that a client can understand and use it. Space exploration and exploitation has a bright future, and AI is a central part of it.",

        "title": "10 Books for the Science Lover on Your List",
        "text": "Is there a science nerd or tree hugger on your Xmas list?\n\nWhether they are a scientist, teacher, or just have a love of learning, here are 10 titles that are perfect for the science lover on your list.\n\nWildhood: The Astounding Connections Between Human and Animal Adolescents by Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, MD, and Kathryn Bowers\n\nIt is easy to think of your teen as uniquely frustrating, but it turns out that all adolescents, both animals and humans, go through similar phases on their journey from childhood to adulthood. As a middle school teacher, and parent of two kids just out of their wildhood, I found this book intriguing. Behaviors that troubled me, like risk-taking and an over dependence on peer opinion, suddenly became a normal biological part of adolescence. Ecologists, teachers and parents alike will benefit from reading this engaging book filled with fascinating biological examples. I loved this book so much I wrote an entire blog about it.\n\nPrisoners of Geography: Ten Maps that Explain everything About the World by Tim Marshall\n\nThis is the book that I\u2019ve tried to get all my friends and family to read. It will change the way you view history and politics forever. One of my pet peeves is that geography is no longer taught in high school and, once you read this book, you will understand why location, location, location is everything. Suddenly, the actions taken by China, Pakistan and other nations will all make sense. To truly understand another nation you have to understand the advantages and disadvantages of its geography. This should be required reading for all political science majors. If you enjoyed Guns, Germs and Steel you will love this book. Luckily, this book is shorter, engaging and much more accessible for all readers.\n\nDarwin\u2019s Armada: Four Voyagers to the Southern Oceans and Their Battle for the Theory of Evolution by Iain McCalman\n\nI love the study of evolution and natural selection. Out of the many books I\u2019ve read about Darwin, this is my favorite. This book places Darwin within the context of his peers. It tells the story of Thomas Huxley, Joseph Hooker, Alfred Wallace, and Charles Darwin. As young men, these four naturalists took their own voyages to South America, Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, South East Asia and Antarctica. The book details their exciting journeys and discoveries. It then explains how all of their ideas came together into the theory of evolution through natural selection. The writing is superb and you feel like you were at the table with those scientific giants.\n\nThe Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America By Douglas Brinkley\n\nTeddy Roosevelt is my favorite president, and I love reading about his passion, energy and antics. This book details how he started the National Parks. Roosevelt was such an engaging character. I think many science lovers will identify with his love of camping and hiking. He was an avid hunter, but this book shows that hunters can be environmentalists because they want to protect nature. He was one of the first to recognize that fashion, which encouraged the hunting of egrets for hat feathers, could drive animals to extinction. This book is long and detailed, but it let\u2019s you see what a true progressive T. Roosevelt was and how farsighted he was with regard to the need to preserve wilderness.\n\nThe Naturalist Theodore Roosevelt: A Lifetime of Exploration, and the Triumph of American Natural History by Darrin Lunde\n\nThis book is shorter and more engaging than The Wilderness Warrior. It is filled with stories of Roosevelt as a boy and young man. It opens with 8 year old Roosevelt seeing a dead seal and racing home to get his notebook and ruler to measure it and take notes about it. It then goes on to describe the natural history museum he created in his bedroom and how he learned taxidermy to create it. This book shows the life of a true nature lover with insatiable curiosity. It discusses the many natural history books he wrote, his work on the National Parks, and the American Natural History Museum in New York. The writing is a perfect example of the power of narrative nonfiction.\n\nMr. Peales\u2019s Museum: Charles Willson Peale and the First Popular Museum of Natural Science and Art by Charles Coleman Sellers\n\nEvery time I travel, I always visit natural history museums. For me, the old ones filled with taxidermy and beautiful painted backdrops are the best. I discovered this book while doing a research paper on museums and loved it. If you are old enough, you probably remember the classic painting of George Washington that used to hang in public school rooms. Charles Wilson Peale painted it, and many other famous portraits of the founding fathers and their families. Peale and his family created the first natural history museum and perfected the art of taxidermy. One of the most fascinating parts of the book was how P.T. Barnum would tear apart taxidermy animals and create \u201cfreaks\u201d by combining them. Barnum\u2019s Museums of Curiosity pulled clients away from true natural history museums. I also learned the \u201cmagic\u201d that early photography and films held for the public. This is a terrific book for lovers of science history and museums.\n\nDr. Tatiana\u2019s Sex Advice to all Creation by Olivia Judson\n\nRetelling these fascinating facts about animals\u2019 sex lives will make you a hit at your next cocktail party. The book is written with a clever format. Each chapter begins with a Dear Tatiana letter from an insect, bird, squid or other animal. Tatiana, in Dr. Ruth fashion, explains what is \u201cnormal\u201d behavior for that species and then compares it to others that are even more extreme. This is a book you can pick up, read a chapter, and set down\u2013perfect for stashing in your purse for long waits. Here is one example:\n\n\u201cAfter a lengthy lovemaking session, the giant octopus\u2026hands over a spermatophore that is a huge bomb. Over a meter long, it contains more than ten billion sperm and explodes inside the female reproductive tract.\u201d -Dr. Tatiana\u2019s Sex Advice to all Creation\n\nI find that most science lovers are not prudes, and I\u2019ll bet there is someone on your list that would get a kick out of this lighthearted book.\n\nThe Log from the Sea of Cortez by John Steinbeck\n\nI\u2019ve traveled extensively throughout Baja so I might be biased when it comes to this book. Steinbeck, the author of Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, and other great novels, was great friends with a biologist Edward F. Ricketts. In 1940, the pair traveled on a sardine boat from Monterey, California, on a 4,000 mile voyage around the Baja peninsula into the Sea of Cortez. The men fished and collected samples the entire voyage. Reading their daily log brought home how much biodiversity has been lost in the Sea of Cortez. Steinbeck\u2019s novella, The Pearl, took place in La Paz, and the love the author has for Baja shines through in his writing.\n\nThe Botany of Desire: A Plant\u2019s Eye View of the World by Michael Pollan\n\nAlthough he is probably better known for his books on healthy eating like The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma, this book is a natural history treat. Each chapter focuses on a different plant and goes into the history, folklore and science about it. My favorite chapter was on apples, where Johnny Appleseed is shown in a far different light then he is taught to school children. It turns out he was spreading apple seeds so pioneers could make alcoholic cider! Johnny also never wore shoes, and Pollan paints a wonderfully disgusting word picture of how hoary and gnarled they were. Another light-hearted read, this book is candy for science nerds and gardeners.\n\nA Lab of One\u2019s Own: One Woman\u2019s Personal Journey Through Sexism in Science By Rita Colwell Ph.D. and Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\n\nAs a science teacher, I am constantly pushing my female students to select STEM careers. This book was an eye opener. The problem isn\u2019t that there aren\u2019t enough women majoring in science, the problem is that they are not given equal access to funding, lab space and selection committee positions. The author started science in the mid century and the beginning of her career is filled with female science heroes such as Rosalind Franklin, Eugene Clark and Barbara McClintock. It also has a recurring villain, James Watson. The author details the difficulties of women with science Ph.Ds from the 1950s through today. The chapters about her studies in cholera were fascinating. She also worked on the government bioterrorism task force when anthrax was sent through the mail in 2001. I love science history, microbiology and feminism so this book was a perfect fit for my interests. It might not be as interesting for a male reader or someone not interested in microbiology.\n\nInterested in nature and mythology? Sign up for my newsletter.",

        "title": "A 1976 Billy Joel \u201cScience Fiction Song\u2019\u2019 Suddenly Describes Today",
        "text": "Cranking up the volume of the Billy Joel Channel, I tell my bride: \u201cHe wrote this in the 1970s. It\u2019s called \u2018Miami 2017,\u2019 \u2014 it was about the future.\u2019\u2019\n\nMy bride shook her head like she saw a dancing ghost as the song starts:\n\n\u201cSeen the lights go out Broadway. I saw the Empire State laid low.\u2019\u2019\n\nBroadway theaters, America\u2019s finest, were supposed to be closed for one month due to the pandemic, but the shutdowns have been extended until at least June 2021. That single shutdown impacts 97,000 jobs for 15 months.\n\nNow 71, Billy Joel wrote this song in 1976 when he was 27, trying to imagine what his beloved New York City might be like in the future.\n\nHe called the song \u201cscience fiction\u2019\u2019 like the 1981 film, \u201cEscape from New York\u2019\u2019 or \u201cBeneath the Planet of the Apes.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe titled his song \u201cMiami 2017\u201d (OK, three years off, but close enough). He figured he would be 68 by 2017, perhaps retired in a place like Florida. It\u2019s told from the point of view of an older man describing a post-apocalyptic disaster ruining New York.\n\nA disaster sending New Yorkers fleeing to Florida?\n\nHe describes New Yorkers (long proud they didn\u2019t need cars) buying Cadillacs and fleeing New York. We then hear about forces who \u201cturned our power down \u2014 And drove us underground.\u2019\u2019\n\nLock-downs in 2020 drove many underground. Barbers to gym owners went \u201cunderground\u2019\u2019 or openly defied emergency orders. Billy Joel added, \u201cBut we went right on with the show.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI saw the ruins at my feet,\u2019\u2019 the song continues. \u201cYou know we almost didn\u2019t notice it.\u2019\u2019\n\nBy August, the New York Post wrote about News Yorkers \u201cfleeing the city in droves, moving to suburbs and other states.\u2019\u2019\n\nJoel made a surprise appearance at a May 2020 \u201cRise New York\u2019\u2019 fundraiser, singing the song as the Empire State Building was lit up. But the pandemic was just the start of New York City\u2019s problems. Many compared the decline to New York in the 1970s when Billy Joel wrote \u201cMiami 2017.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs \u201c30 days to slow the spread\u2019\u2019 became the \u201cnew normal\u2019\u2019 summer saw anxiety, depression, crime, and violence soar. The George Floyd case tore New York up with riots, looting, and attacks on statues and churches. A majority in a new poll feared America was on the verge of a new civil war.\n\nThe song predicts churches burning, comparing the scene to civil war: \u201cThey burned the churches down in Harlem. Like in that Spanish civil war.\n\nThe flames were everywhere, but no one really cared. It always burned up there before.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother iconic moment of the pandemic was the U.S. Navy ship USNS Comfort being sent to New York City from the U.S. Naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, named in the song: \u201cThey sent a carrier out from Norfolk and picked the Yankees up for free.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe song predicts working-class Queens staying and references and \u201csank Manhattan out at sea,\u201d alluding to a year when the rich who could work remotely left cities in greater numbers.\n\nIn a year when history is forgotten or deleted as monuments are toppled, he sings, \u201cThere are not many who remember. They say a handful still survive.\n\nTo tell the world about the way the lights went out and keep the memory alive.\u2019\u2019",

        "title": "Natural Progression of Development: We Can Only Apply Advice When It\u2019s Time",
        "text": "You have to do things enough that the natural progression of what you are doing propels you to take the next step. It\u2019s really why we need to show up every day and work on our thing. If we aren\u2019t working on it we can\u2019t progress with it. We can read all the self-help articles we want to, but if we aren\u2019t in the natural progression of the thing no amount of tips can help us move forward. Reading gobs of articles will educate you, but if you aren\u2019t ready for what they are saying you will just pile up information that can overwhelm you and make you procrastinate even more.\n\nI started writing about four years ago. I started reading anything I could get my hands on about how to create a blog and then quickly jumped to reading about how to write and market a book. I was cramming my head with information that I wasn\u2019t ready for. I hadn\u2019t even got into the swing of a daily writing habit and was already trying to figure out what book I should write. I was feeding myself with some of the best how-to articles out there before beginning the process of just writing and figuring out what the heck writing was going to mean to me. I was missing the main piece of the whole thing. No wonder I was having a hard time adding to it.\n\nHow I Made $11,000 From Writing in 30 Days\n\nI click on it. I am guessing you might too, or some variation that has to do with your craft/art/creative thing. I could use $11,000 extra dollars. Well times that by ten. Yeah, I could use that. So I spend a lot of time clicking on articles like that. They provide helpful tips. I click on them every day, but if I am not consistently doing what it is I want to do, I will have nothing to apply those tips to. Reading lots of blog posts and listening to pod casts is not actually creating. Actually sitting down and creating is creating. Do you do that?\n\nAchieve Success Faster With These 10 Tips\n\nI am sure these tips would help someone become successful. I am sure these tips could help you if applied, at the right time. I write more and more every day. Obsess over it in fact. The more I simply write, anywhere, the more I want to write and the more I want to try writing. I found that I have naturally progressed to submitting articles to magazines and publications. Something I was never ready to do before I had a regular writing habit. It was something that I had read a lot about, and used to lay a big guilt trip on myself for not doing, but in reality all I really needed to do at first was just write.\n\nThe natural progression of doing so would make submitting stories a natural step, but the habit needed to exist before I could apply tips to it. I also needed time to develop my thing. There was no way around the fact that I needed to show up every day for a long period of time before understanding what I really wanted to do anyway. There are no tips or shortcuts available to substitute for what genuinely takes time to figure out.\n\nTen More Reasons Why You Should Quit Your Job and Work For Yourself\n\nThis is why I started writing in the first place. I found myself in a career transition that was difficult and a job that I hated. My husband suggested I started writing and see if I could make it as a writer. Sounds great, but in reality we had bills to pay and I wasn\u2019t in a state of mind to get anything going fast enough to subvert my need for a regular job.\n\nIf you just picked up a pen, paint brush, modeling clay, or are learning how to code, concentrate on that really hard. Feed yourself with some good information, but understand that your progression will be your progression. It\u2019s great to hear how everyone else did it, but in the end how we do things will be how we do things. Take things in and apply them when the time is right for you. You can find as many articles that say to quit your job as ones that say to keep it. So concentrate on your thing, a lot, and in time you will know all by yourself what you are ready to do. If you don\u2019t you can always start reading articles again and use them to get new direction, but I\u2019m betting you have what you need to get started.\n\nYou Have to Show Up Every. Day.\n\nWhat we hate about work really. The fact I have to come here every day is so annoying. The same people, same desk, same tasks, same goals. Dang those employers. They know how to make money and get things done and they do it by getting people to show up every single day. There are penalties if we don\u2019t. That consistency at work exists before anything else. We can have the best ideas, hire the best people, establish the most efficient processes, but if we don\u2019t show up every day and do the work all that means nothing. Consistency comes before we can add anything else.\n\nI have seen too many people in my career think that there is some natural progression to life, with certain career milestones preceding whatever you may want in your personal life. Unfortunately, life doesn\u2019t know it is supposed to follow a schedule. Ruth Porat\n\nI am not talking about making hard and fast rules. There is a time and place for outlines, planners, to-do lists, and business plans. Those are all fine and well, but first comes starting. We have to start the thing and then show up every day and do it. Get into that rhythm for a while and then start to filter in new information. Do it for a while longer and see how that fits into the bigger scheme of our lives.\n\nIf you want to start a business start a business. If you are dabbling with something you hope will grow and develop into something substantial then by all means do some goal setting, make some to-do lists, and create a plan, but remember in the end you cannot subvert the need to consistently show up and do your thing so as to allow a natural progression of development to occur. As you do you will know what to do. An inner prompting will tell you it\u2019s time for the next step. All those articles are going to help you know what the next step is.\n\nNothing is more motivating then understanding naturally what we should do next. Those aha moments are irreplaceable. Once we understand what needs done few things can prevent us from doing them. At that point we need little help and outside motivation. We run at things with full force. That\u2019s usually when we start making goals and formal plans. Trust the process to show you what is next and help you develop your thing in your way. Consistently feed yourself with information, but realize that there will be the right time to apply it and that time will reveal itself through the natural progression of development.\n\nMarcy Pedersen",

Mostly, I laugh the laugh of crazed serial killers\u2014the kind of back-of-the-throat guttural cackle that causes most people to slowly step away.\n\nI\u2019ve been writing since I was a child, and the idea of starting my day in front of a blank page is just as comforting as gouging out my eyes with an acetylene torch. Over the past decade, I\u2019ve had two of my books published by traditional houses while balancing demanding jobs and a full-time life. And guess what? I didn\u2019t have time for the romanticized writer existence where one sips freshly brewed coffee while wearing their threadbare robe as depicted in bad movies and blog posts. Of course, all writers are the coffee-guzzling, unkempt superstitious sort.\n\nIn college, the editor of the literary review approached me with a copy of my short story in hand. He looked at the paper and then up at me in confusion, as if he couldn\u2019t reconcile the woman wearing a flannel shirt and baseball cap with the woman who wrote a story about her mother being her first hurt. After he complimented the story, he said in a smaller voice that I didn\u2019t look like a writer, to which I responded, \u201cWell, what the fuck is a writer supposed to look like?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need to write every day if that\u2019s not your way; you just need to be committed to what you write.\n\nBack then, I had moxie.\n\nI was born to write, but I was also born to build brands, and this realization often created tension between the two worlds I inhabited. Book friends were astounded to discover that I earn a six-figure salary, and marketing friends held up my book and said, \u201cYou wrote this? Wow, I didn\u2019t know you were a writer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible to be more than one thing. Few people realize this simple, true fact.\n\nWriters don\u2019t \u201clook\u201d a certain way. There is no one way to be a writer or to write a novel other than your way. I don\u2019t toil away every morning in front of a Word document. Instead, I negotiate contracts with clients on conference calls, mentor marketing executives, beg for student loan deferments (\u201cyes, I\u2019ll hold\u201d), build businesses (\u201cyes, I\u2019ll continue to hold\u201d), and write when I can because my dark, experimental fiction isn\u2019t paying the bills.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s okay, even downright necessary, to take the paycheck. While seeing your book prominently displayed on the new fiction table at Barnes and Noble is sexy (and also a beautiful fiction for most writers in its own right), having a home to come home to and a hot meal is even sexier. The constant of basic creature comforts far outweighs the suffering, starving artist trope.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to write every day if that\u2019s not your way; you just need to be committed to what you write. Determination and persistence are the most valuable weapons in a writer\u2019s arsenal. Writing comes more easily to me than most, but that doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t commit myself to the work. Nothing happens until you move\u2014until words get on the page.\n\nLet\u2019s first get something crystal-clear. Even when you\u2019re not physically putting thought to paper, you\u2019re writing. You\u2019re thinking about your characters on the way to work. You\u2019re jotting down dialogue in bed at night. You\u2019re doing research while eating lunch at your desk. You\u2019re dictating scenes into your phone on the 405 because traffic hasn\u2019t moved in an hour, and writing is better than having a rage blackout. Being a writer is about understanding that the work that goes into the writing is just as important and relevant as the writing itself.\n\nWe fear and succumb to failure before we\u2019ve typed our first word without understanding that success is comprised of a million little failures.\n\nAgatha Christie once said, \u201cThe best time for planning a book is while you\u2019re doing the dishes.\u201d This is how I\u2019ve managed to publish two books and countless stories and essays over the past two decades. I created space and time for the work while understanding the pragmatic reality otherwise known as life. Neuroscience tells us that we\u2019re wired to cleave to that which is safe and known. Experience and repetition define that knowing. Along comes an idea for a book\u2014a dense forest rife with unknowns\u2014and if given the choice, we\u2019ll file our taxes and our nails over putting thought to type. That\u2019s one of the many arcane ways we stand in our own way.\n\nWe retreat into the comfort of complacency instead of risking the possible magic of a new reality. We fear and succumb to failure before we\u2019ve typed our first word without understanding that success is comprised of a million little failures. We give up because the largeness of the novel is a weight too heavy to bear instead of thinking about writing as Margaret Atwood would have it: \u201cA word after a word after a word is power.\u201d\n\nYou build a house brick by brick. You rely on drawings, schematics, measurements, and plans and make adjustments as you go. No one wakes one day and\u2014poof\u2014there\u2019s the house. The act of building is the becoming, so why would writing be any different? You build a book word by word, line by line, paragraph by paragraph, page by page, chapter by chapter. And there you have it, what Sylvia Plath once called \u201cthe long short story.\u201d We often forget the smallest of parts creates the beautiful whole.\n\nThe first substantial revision of my second book in 2014.\n\nIn Zadie Smith\u2019s beloved essay \u201cThat Crafty Feeling,\u201d she archetypes two kinds of writers: the Macro Planner and the Micro Manager. The Macro Planner lives for their notebook, Post-its, sketches, plot outlines, and character sketches; they\u2019ve written the whole book in their head before they even sat down to type. They live for the blueprints and plans, and the house is pre-fab. Apparently, Graham Greene was a Macro Planner. Meanwhile, the Micro Manager plays the page as it lays. They start with the first line and somehow navigate their way to the last one, and they have no idea where the story will go. Smith puts it this way:\n\nMicro Managers build a house floor by floor, discretely and in its entirety. Each floor needs to be sturdy and fully decorated with all the furniture in place before the next is built on top of it. There\u2019s wallpaper in the hall even if the stairs lead nowhere at all.\n\nWhile most of my waking life is engineered by my type-A personality, my writing life is ostensibly nomadic. As much as I want to create an outline and various endings, I always find myself wrapped up in a particular character and taking joy in seeing where the character goes. For me, the writing is more heated and ephemeral, and it\u2019s that heat that keeps me curious and mobile. I am notorious for writing multiple drafts of a novel because certain plotlines didn\u2019t work or the ending fell flat or some characters needed to be excised or I just realized I needed something in the middle of the book although I\u2019m not quite sure what that something is. In my second book, Follow Me Into the Dark, I didn\u2019t develop the principle plot twist until my third substantial rewrite.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve sent you into a panic, know that I\u2019ve shifted my process to be more of fusion between the micro and macro. I no longer walk into the complete unknown. Here\u2019s how I do it:\n\n1. Decide if You Can Live With Your Character or Idea Long-Term\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve read articles, books, and news reports, and I\u2019ve felt the spark. Maybe I should write about dissociative fugue states! Maybe I should retell Jonestown from Jim Jones\u2019 wife\u2019s point of view! The sparks are the equivalent of standing in the supermarket checkout line and padding your cart with issues of Us Weekly and Snickers bars. The ideas offer instant gratification but nothing sustaining over the long haul.\n\nThen I road test each idea for a couple of weeks. Am I up for the research? Who are my principle characters? Do they fascinate me enough for 200 pages plus rewrites? Even if I don\u2019t know the plot just yet (I almost never do), could I sketch out a vague idea of where the story could go? What are my three acts? I tend to map out the general idea for the book, and I spend a little more time on the characters. If I\u2019m bored after two or three weeks, odds are I\u2019ll be bored after a few months.\n\n2. Start Sketching a Loose Character/Plot Outline\n\nIf I don\u2019t hate the plot or the people, I compose real character sketches. As you can probably tell, I avoid the word outline because \u201coutline\u201d used to mean shackles and commitment, but now I realize it\u2019s a tool that reduces the number of rewrites. I keep the plot sketch loose\u2014it\u2019s merely directional. Because I\u2019m physically unable to write a book linearly (trust me, I\u2019ve tried), I spend a little more time on the structure. Will these be alternating chapters that are character-led, or is time the primary driver of the story? I often find that drivers tend to be plot, place, time, or character, and that helps me navigate the structure.\n\nThe point here is getting to the first draft by any means necessary.\n\nI spend more time on timelines than plotlines, if you can believe it. Mostly, I spend time with the characters. I visualize them as real people. I hear them talking (not literally\u2014you know what I mean). I hear their way of talk. What\u2019s their vernacular, lexicon, speech patterns, vocabulary (is there a vocabulary I have to learn)? Where do they live and is their geography pertinent to them as a character? Who are they as people? What do they like? Who do they trust?\n\nI love writing broken people and exploring how they navigate their life, so for me, context is key. What\u2019s their history? Do I need research for their history? For example, my lead character in my second book was a sociopath\u2014Ted Bundy with a whisk, if you will\u2014so I had to do a lot of research on sociopathic behavior. I commit to my characters because the more real they are to me, the stakes are higher and their actions and nuance are easier to map out. Character always leads me to plot.\n\n3. Start Where It Feels Natural\n\nI\u2019ve never started a book by writing the first line\u2014that\u2019s entirely too loaded and too much pressure. I pick the easiest point of entry, a scene, and I often start books in the middle. Scenes are excellent because they afford you velocity. Things are happening, and people are talking.\n\nFor me, nothing happens until something moves. If I can\u2019t see the periphery or the details of the scene, I\u2019ll start with straight dialogue and fill in narrative later. All that matters to me is movement.\n\n4. Know the Writing Will Be Garbage in the First Drafts\n\nEven the most prolific authors (okay, maybe Vladimir Nabokov with his notecards is the exception) have garbage first drafts. Jhumpa Lahiri has talked extensively about her process, which includes multiple messy drafts. No one\u2019s reading your first draft. No one expects you to have a polished draft. The point here is getting to the first draft by any means necessary. If that means creating 50 pages of exposition that you sense you might have to toss later, awesome. That means you know your characters more, the plot has become clearer, and more importantly, you start to figure out where the characters and story can\u2019t go.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not writing, you\u2019re writing.\n\nPolish isn\u2019t the point\u2014movement is. Get the story down and the characters talking, and later on, you can fuss about the carpeting and the drapes. That\u2019s what editing is for; writing is about getting a story on paper\u2014word by word, brick by brick.\n\n5. Assess Each Chapter\n\nI didn\u2019t do this practice until recently, to be candid, but it\u2019s extraordinarily useful. I used to just write and write, and although I still do that to a certain extent, I do get a little more reflective after the draft I\u2019ve written.\n\nI have a whiteboard (which used to be a spreadsheet) where I jot down the pertinent details of every chapter. Where did the plot go? What happened to the characters? What do I feel is missing? (This is more about your gut.) Were there any revelations? Places I didn\u2019t expect to go? Having this board up while I write helps because I glance at it every so often to remind me where I am and where I could potentially go. It also serves as a working roadmap, providing guidance so I don\u2019t veer too far off course.\n\n6. Fill the Non-Writing Spaces\n\nSometimes the words just don\u2019t come. I\u2019ve read the countless articles and books that tell you to write something, anything, and I\u2019m here to tell you that\u2019s nonsense. I don\u2019t have three hours in the morning to waste on writing for the sake of writing. Instead, I can do research. I can meditate on the characters. Brainstorm plot points. Get specific on elements of the character, place, and story that are not yet known to me.\n\nRemember, even if you\u2019re not writing, you\u2019re writing.\n\n7. Make a Writing Plan Each Month\n\nI\u2019ve gone months without writing. From 2009 to 2013, I didn\u2019t write at all. I don\u2019t make a formal plan until I feel I have enough to go on. If steps one and two aren\u2019t in play, I can\u2019t waste time dreaming about the book. For me to prioritize the book in my life, it has to be real to me, which means I need a foundation.\n\nAfter I explore the idea of the story, my commitment to it, and character and plot sketches, then I map out a list dump of all the preliminary things I need to do to get started. Then I schedule the tasks into three five-hour buckets each week. More, if I\u2019m lucky. I break down those buckets into two-hour sprints and focus on one task of the book.\n\nFor example, the list for my second novel started with these tasks:\n\nResearch on sociopathic behavior and serial killers. Subtask: Find two or three good books and 10 articles relevant to my research. Read them.\n\nSubtask: Find two or three good books and 10 articles relevant to my research. Read them. Narrow down the serial killer that most resembles my character and learn as much as I can about that person . Subtask: Find audio, psychological assessments, documentaries, etc. I chose Ted Bundy as a model, and I immersed myself, for better or worse, in all that was Bundy. My character mimicked much of his modus operandi down to his education and way of talk. I mapped out which traits I wanted to hone in on that fascinated me and were relevant to my character. What started as general research became a bulleted list of aspects of Bundy that could inspire my character.\n\n. Subtask: Find audio, psychological assessments, documentaries, etc. I chose Ted Bundy as a model, and I immersed myself, for better or worse, in all that was Bundy. My character mimicked much of his modus operandi down to his education and way of talk. I mapped out which traits I wanted to hone in on that fascinated me and were relevant to my character. What started as general research became a bulleted list of aspects of Bundy that could inspire my character. Map out general plot, structure, and character outlines. Subtask: Complete composites of each character (this is much like the customer segmentation work I do in marketing but with less data) and determine geography, timeline, and structure. Doing so opened up additional research (e.g., how people spoke in the 1950s and 1960s, Nevada, California).\n\n(Notice that I haven\u2019t written a word yet with these tasks. And that\u2019s okay.)\n\nWrite out, in paragraphs, scene summaries that I\u2019d ideally like to develop.\n\nDevelop a scene.\n\nI make a monthly plan and modulate during the week. If I set aside time on Thursday to write the scene and it doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019ll swap that task for another one on my list so at least something gets done, and I\u2019m moving the book forward. Rinse, lather, repeat.",

        "title": "How to Organize Your Article Writing",
        "text": "Tapping the full potential of your ideas\n\nPhoto courtesy of author\n\nHalloween was coming and I knew a ghost story. Bringing the tale of the priest, the farmer, and the traveler to the readers might seem simple \u2014 after all, the exorcism occurred over two hundred years ago. But, writing a compelling article required more than skill with words. There were historians to find and entice into an interview, a sunny village and a caretaker to photograph, a museum director to get on the phone, and old records to mine for information. As usually happens, once all the information became available, the story wasn\u2019t as simple as I had thought. Unimaginable conflicts brewed even in the present day. Only after I pulled the parts together and really thought about things could I write a decent article and get it to my editor in time for a pre-Halloween publication.\n\nTaking the time to plan and organize the tasks involved in article writing sets the stage for a good article and a pleasant experience. Here\u2019s a few things I\u2019ve found helpful:\n\nPhoto courtesy of author\n\nIdentify the least controllable tasks\n\nSchedule and do them as early as possible.\n\nFor instance, if you are writing an article about a historic garden only open on the weekends, call ahead to doublecheck availability and get that visit out of the way. You don\u2019t want to be down to the wire and find you have only one day to do this \u2014 the day your child breaks out in a rash.\n\nMost interviews should be scheduled as early as possible in the writing process. Not only will this help assure you interview the critical people for your article, but you will also have time to follow up on the leads they\u2019ll give you. Interviews almost always lead to new research or additional interviews or opportunities. If you wait till the end of your process, you won\u2019t have time to schedule any follow-up work.\n\nYou should approach article writing with an open mind and be ready to learn new, unexpected things. Remember, your best articles are going to show your readers something they don\u2019t already know. Unless you\u2019re a subject matter expect, you\u2019ll also learn things along the way. Be open-minded and ready for the unexpected by getting your interviews and site visits out of the way early.\n\nWeather is a challenge and can ruin your site visit plans. If you are going to take or arrange photographs for your article, the weather can be your biggest friend or a real pain. Get out there early, before the hurricane. You can always do a second visit if, for instance, a lovely snow fall creates the perfect backdrop for your shot of sled dogs.\n\nSome activities \u2014 like interviews with a government official or a visit to a youth treatment facility \u2014 may require special permission. Those can take time. Plan for that.\n\nIdentify low-key activities\n\nWriting articles also includes a number of relatively easy, mundane, but necessary tasks. Examples could be reading and taking notes on articles for background knowledge or scanning postcards for illustrations. Do these when you are having an \u201coff\u201d day or time.\n\nPhoto courtesy of author\n\nKnow your optimum times and settings for productive writing\n\nEvery writer has their own rhythm. Know when you are best at creative work and set those times aside for actually writing and revising your article. If you have a special place (or coffee mug) that helps you do good work, use them.\n\nPhoto courtesy of author\n\nLet your writing breathe\n\nStop writing after your first draft and let your work rest. Wait at least overnight before you revise it. By taking a break, you\u2019ll see more opportunities to improve your work.\n\nTake advantage of available tools and resources\n\nYou can maximize what you\u2019ve already purchased (your phone, computer, and software) by spending time learning more about their bells and whistles. Look up those user manuals.\n\nBuild in redundancy to help guarantee you stay on track. For example, I schedule my work on a wall calendar, my phone, and in a folder on my computer, lessening the risk of missing a deadline.\n\nConsider using additional proprietary tools. You might like to use Trello to create online versions of boards, lists, and sticky notes. Trello has a free version. Scrivener offers writers a robust means of keeping facts at hand and offers has a free trial. You can find other online aids.\n\nWhether you use virtual aids or old school ring binders, making the effort to keep your workflow and information organized will enhance your article writing experience.\n\nWhile Ben Franklin may have said, \u201cFor every minute spent in organizing, an hour is gained,\u201d organizing your article writing will give you much more than just free time. Being organized will benefit your readers, please your editor, and result in a better end product. You\u2019ll have the space to be fully creative and express yourself the way you\u2019d like.",

        "text": "Incentives can change behaviour\n\nIn 2018, just over 7 million people in the UK smoked, or 14.7% of the population. That\u2019s 5% less than in 2011, a remarkable reduction in seven years. How was this done?\n\nPeople\u2019s behaviour changed through the use of incentives.\n\nThe moral incentive encouraging smokers to stop has been well known for decades. Smoking\u2019s terrible for your health. A smoker is 15 to 30 times more likely to either contract lung cancer or die from it than non-smokers. Advertising campaigns using shock tactics to communicate how bad smoking is have done a great job to reinforce its effects on health.\n\nThere was a time when smoking was considered good for you, and the act of smoking was integrated into everyday society. It was the norm, and laws made it easy to smoke. It\u2019s incredible to think there was a time you could smoke on planes. We\u2019ve come a long way since then.\n\nSmokers are now given designated areas to smoke. You\u2019re labeled as and feel like a \u2018smoker\u2019. An outsider, different from the rest. The convenience of smoking has now turned into an inconvenience. In shops and supermarkets, cigarettes are hidden out of sight, adding to the stigma associated with smoking.\n\nThen there\u2019s the financial incentive. Government tax on cigarettes is high, making cigarettes an expensive habit worth giving up. An average pack of cigarettes is \u00a38 ($10.40), 80% of which is tax.\n\nA combination of the three incentives has had a dramatic impact on the number of smokers in the UK. But the change could only happen with government intervention. Policies to stop people smoking have been central in driving behavioural change.",

A funny red blow-up man blowing around in the wind next to a sign. A promotional gimmick for a gym that\u2019s hidden from the road.\n\nI\u2019m not in the market for a new gym, so it didn\u2019t entice me. It did make me aware there was a gym there though.\n\nWhen we think about writing headlines, it\u2019s tempting to come up with something clever, funny, or intriguing to catch our reader\u2019s eye.\n\nWe wonder how we can entice readers with something unusual.\n\nIn the Headline Hacks column, I\u2019ve shared the most highly rated sensorial words and power words. I\u2019ve let you in on proven headline formulas and templates that lead to magnetic titles. I\u2019ve even dissected popular TED Talk headlines.\n\nWell, today I want to break headlines down to its simplest \u2014 a quick, easy way for you to build confidence in your headlines. This is one way I come up with headlines. It\u2019s how I came up with the headline for this article without fussing or worrying about it.\n\nIt\u2019s this: Write headlines from the thoughts in your head.\n\nThey will be specific. And come from a real curiosity, need, or problem.\n\nYou\u2019ll avoid clickbait because your thoughts are genuine and casual. Natural.\n\nFor instance, say you have trouble cutting down how much you eat and want some help. Maybe a nutritionist, a health consultant, the latest research, or others in the same predicament have useful tips to share. What would you Google?\n\nPerhaps:\n\nHow to stop overeating so I don\u2019t feel tired all the time, or\n\nHow to eat less and have more energy\n\nLet\u2019s check what the headline analyzer tool, CoSchedule ranks these headlines and how it breaks them down:\n\nHow to stop overeating so I don\u2019t feel tired all the time \u2014 74",

        "text": "When I Realized Writing is More Than a Passion\n\nIt\u2019s a part of who I am\n\nPhoto by Dariusz Sankowski on Unsplash\n\nIn the beginning, I used to write for recreation. I\u2019ve been told I have a vivid imagination, and I\u2019ve always needed an outlet to express it. To pen down the stories swirling around in my head.\n\nBack then, I lacked the skill and dedication to write professionally. But as I read more, I learned more. Once I entered my late teens, I turned my focus from writing short stories to full-length novels. Ever since I saw the name \u201cEnid Blyton\u201d on my first children\u2019s book, I knew I wanted my name on a book one day. Now was my time.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t realize one thing \u2014 writing novels is hard work. I\u2019ve lost count of how many first drafts I started only to abandon them after the first few pages. I lacked the patience and perseverance to see it through to the end. So when I finished my first novella at the age of 19, I was elated. It was exhilarating, holding that book in my hands, seeing my name on the cover, hearing people\u2019s plaudits and criticism about the story. It was more than everything I ever dreamed of.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve written another novella and a full-length novel. Another novel is set to release in the coming few days. On top of that, I\u2019ve written a plethora of articles as well. I write a lot, is the bottom line. Which is all well and good, but\u2026 there\u2019s always been something nagging at me. Something I couldn\u2019t define.\n\nI never referred to my books as my books, just as the books. Whenever someone asked me what I did, I said I\u2019m a law student. I completely forgot to mention I was a novelist as well. Everyone else called me a writer. Only I didn\u2019t.\n\nWhy? What was happening?",

        "title": "Building a dynamic and responsive Pinterest",
        "text": "Bo Liu | Engineering Manager, Serving Systems team\n\nIn 2015, the majority of content on Pinterest was pregenerated for users prior to login. It was stored statically in HBase and served directly upon entering the service. (More details can be found in the blog post Building a smarter home feed.)\n\nAlthough our earlier architecture helped us grow to 100 million monthly active users by 2015, it had several weak points that prevented us from building more dynamic and responsive products. For example, it was hard to experiment with different ideas and models on different components in the system. Since content was pregenerated, the features used to rank candidates could be weeks old, and we couldn\u2019t leverage the most recent Pin/Board/User data, not to mention real-time user actions. We also had to pre-generate and store content for every user, including those who never returned. Moreover, we were constantly running a large number of concurrent experiments and needed to pre-generate and store content for each experiment. The storage cost was huge.\n\nThough a dynamic and responsive Pinterest is more attractive to Pinners, it imposes demanding requirements on our backend systems.\n\nTo solve the technical problems, we built nine different systems that collectively power today\u2019s fully dynamic and responsive Pinterest products. Though these systems were built for Pinterest, they solve common problems to many web-scale consumer-facing content distribution applications. Here, we\u2019ll discuss these systems and how they changed the backend architectures powering the major Pinterest products, including Following Feed, Interest Feed, and Picked For You (recommendations).\n\nChallenges\n\nFirstly, a following graph, Owner-to-Board mappings, and Board-to-Pin mappings need to be stored and updated in real-time. Though we have this information in our MySQL and HBase clusters, it takes too long to query them from those data stores for online applications (more than one round trip per request, big fanout and large data scanning).\n\nAnother big challenge was the lack of a high performance machine learning ranking system to rank thousands of pieces of content per request with a P99 latency of small dozens of ms. To provide feature data to this ML ranking system, some stateful services with batching and real-time update support are needed. These stateful services must provide not only KV data model, but also more complicated data models like counts, lists, etc. These stateful services must answer queries with single digit P99 latency given the latency requirement of the ML ranking system depending on them.\n\nLastly, we need a candidate generation system to provide high-quality candidate sets in real-time for content recommendations.\n\nFollowing feed\n\nFig. 1: Former Following Feed\n\nFig. 1 depicts following feed circa 2015. Whenever a Pin was saved, an asynchronous task was enqueued to Pinlater, an asynchronous job execution system. This task would first retrieve all (direct and indirect) followers for the Pin\u2019s board from MySQL via the follower service, and then it would send the (follower list, Pin) to a smart feed worker. The smart feed worker would leverage Pinnability to score the Pin for every follower and then insert the list of (follower, score, Pin) into HBase. When a user came to Pinterest, we scanned HBase with the user id as the prefix to extract the Pins with the largest scores for this user. This implementation consumed unnecessarily large storage space and made it hard to leverage fresh signals and experiment with new ideas. Additionally, the long latency for fetching the follower list (steps 2 and 3) and ranking (step 5) prevented us from experimenting online.\n\nFig. 2: Current Following Feed\n\nIn the current version of the following feed shown in Fig. 2, components in green are newly built systems, while the database shape indicates stateful services (we use the same terminology throughout this post). The mapping from user to directly- and indirectly-followed boards is stored and real-time updated in Apiary, which supports low latency queries suitable for online applications. Board-to-Pin mappings and some lightweight Pin data are stored and real-time updated in Polaris, which not only supports board based Pin retrieval but also filtering with passed-in bloom filter as well as lightweighted scoring to select high quality pins.\n\nWhen a request is sent to Feed Generator to fetch a user\u2019s following feed, it concurrently fetches real-time signals for the user, boards followed by the user, and Pins seen by the user recently from RealPin, Apiary and Aperture, respectively.\n\nRealPin is a highly customizable object retrieval system providing a rich data model for object storage and data aggregation along the time dimension. We customized RealPin to track and serve real-time user signals. Aperture was firstly designed for content deduping; it stores all user events, including backend and frontend Pin impressions, and returns impression history of up to a few months for any user, all with single-digit P99 latency. Aperture was later adapted to serve the ads user action counting use case as described in the blog post Building a real-time user action counting system for ads.\n\nFeed Generator then sends to Polaris the board list and the bloom filter consisting of the impression history of the user. After retrieving, filtering and applying lightweight scoring, Polaris returns a list of Pins to Feed Generator. Lastly, this list of Pins and real-time user signals are sent to Scorpion for a second pass of full scoring. Scorpion is a unified ML online ranking platform powering the majority of Pinterest ML models in production. We have Counter service and Rockstore underlying Scorpion to provide count signals and user data, pin data, etc. Note that Scorpion aggressively caches static feature data in local memory, which is the larger part of all feature data required by ML models. Scorpion is sharded to achieve a cache hit rate over 90%.\n\nInterest feed\n\nFig. 3: Former Interest Feed\n\nFig. 3 depicts the 2015 version of the interest feed architecture, which is similar to the following feed described in Fig. 1. The main difference was content generation was triggered by daily jobs, and source data was stored in HBase instead of MySQL.\n\nFig. 4: Current Interest Feed\n\nPicked for you (recommendations)\n\nFig. 5: Former Picked For You (recommendations)\n\nThe \u201cPicked For You\u201d architecture from 2015 is depicted in Fig. 5. Its content generation was also triggered by daily jobs. A periodic offline job generated a list of boards for each user as the seeds for Pin recommendation. These seed boards were batch uploaded to Terrapin for serving.\n\nFig. 6: Current Picked For You (recommendations)\n\nFig. 6 depicts the current \u201cPicked For You\u201d architecture. Pixie is a new service built for real-time board recommendation. It periodically loads into memory an offline-generated graph consisting of boards and Pins. When recommended boards are requested for a user, a random walk is simulated in the Pixie graph by using the Pins engaged by the user as starting points. (More can be found in the blog post Introducing Pixie, an advanced graph-based recommendation system.) The rest of the systems are similar to following feed.\n\nBrief technical discussions\n\nThroughout the process of building systems from scratch to enable fully dynamic and responsive Pinterest products, we needed to make design decisions with reasonable tradeoffs, solve technical problems, and optimize systems to meet the latency requirement for online applications.\n\nBack in 2015, the majority of Pinterest\u2019s backend systems were implemented in Java, and we hadn\u2019t built any systems in C++. As we can see from the previous sections, the new systems must achieve low long-tail latency with big fanout (sometimes all shard fanout), and some systems are CPU intensive (e.g., Scorpion, Pixie and RealPin). We chose to adopt C++11, FBThrift, Folly and RocksDB to build these systems. It was slow at the beginning since we had to install all dependencies, build several basic facility libraries (like stats reporting, request routing, etc.), and set up our build & release environment. It eventually paid off as we used our new foundation to get more and more efficient and effective systems built across the company.\n\nRocksDB is an embedded storage engine. To build sharded and replicated distributed systems on top of it, data replication was the first problem we needed to solve. We started with the write-to-all-replica approach and later moved to master-slave replication. Our systems are running on AWS, which models its network into Regions, Availability Zones and Placement Groups. Notably, the bill for cross-AZ network traffic is significant. We built a prefix-based AZ-aware traffic routing library that minimizes cross-AZ traffic and supports all possible routing patterns (e.g., single shard, multiple shard and all shard fanout). The library also monitors TCP connection health and gracefully fails over requests among replicas. One thing to note is we needed to leverage the TCP_USER_TIMEOUT socket options to fail fast when the OS on remote peer crashed. It is not uncommon for a VM instance to become unreachable on AWS for various reasons without shutting down TCP connections. If TCP_USER_TIMEOUT is not set, a typical TCP implementation could take over 10 minutes to report the issue to user space applications. (More details about data replication and traffic routing can be found in the Rocksplicator Github repo and blog post Open-sourcing Rocksplicator, a real-time RocksDB data replicator.)\n\nOver 10% of Pinterest\u2019s total AWS instances run our systems. To reduce the operational overhead and service downtime, we integrated Apache Helix (a cluster management framework open sourced by Linkedin) with Rocksplicator. (More details can be found in the blog post Automated cluster management and recovery for Rocksplicator.)\n\nWe did numerous optimizations and tunings when implementing and productionizing these systems. For instance, we needed to tune the RocksDB compaction thread number and set L0 and L1 to be of the same size to reduce write amplification and improve write throughput.\n\nOne of the counter service clusters must support returning tens of thousands of counts for a single request with a P99 latency less than 20 ms. To achieve that, we switched to RocksDB plain table and configured it to something essentially like an in-memory hash table. We also had to switch to float16 to reduce data size and manually encode lists of returned counts into binary strings to save serialization and deserialization overhead. For big requests, counter service may also leverage multiple threads to process a single request.\n\nThough RealPin was designed as an object retrieval system, we customized it to run as an online scoring system for several months. However, we noticed it was a challenge to operate the system given it co-locates computation and storage. This issue became more serious as we started to use more types of feature data. Ultimately, we developed the new Scorpion system, which separates computation from storage and caches feature data on the computation nodes.\n\nAs Scorpion is CPU intensive and running on big clusters, we needed to invest heavily in optimizing it. We carefully tuned the Scorpion threading model to achieve a good tradeoff between high concurrent processing and low context switch or synchronization overhead. The sweet spot is not fixed, as it depends on many factors such as if data is fetched from memory, local disk or RPC. We optimized the in-memory LRU caching module to achieve zero-copy; i.e., cached data is fed into ML models without any data copying. Batch scoring was implemented to allow GCC to better utilize SIMD instructions. Decision trees in GBDT models are compacted and carefully laid out in memory to achieve better CPU cache hit rates. Thundering herds on cache miss are avoided by object level synchronization.\n\nData stored in Aperture is bucketed along the time dimension. We use a frozen data format for old data which is immutable and suitable for fast read access. More recent data is stored in a mutable format which is efficient for updates. The max_successive_merges RocksDB option was leveraged to limit the number of merge operands in mem-table from the same key. This setting is critical for Aperture to achieve low read latency since it may need to read a RocksDB key with a large number of merge operands, which are expensive to process at read time. To save storage space, RocksDB was configured to use different compression policies and multiplier factors for different levels.\n\nIf these types of challenges interest you, join our team! And keep an eye on this blog for more posts and information on the open sourcing of some of our systems.\n\nAcknowledgements: In addition to the Serving Systems team, we\u2019d like to thank our client teams for providing useful feedbacks, helping building and adopting the systems \u2014 Home Feed, Related Pins, Ads, Interest, Applied Science, Visual Search, Spam, etc.",

        "title": "How Startups Get Out Of Survival Mode and Into Growth Mode",
        "text": "When should a startup begin planning for growth? The answer is now.\n\nThe unconventional truth is that a startup should very rarely be acting out of survival \u2014 living from one sale to the next or from one month to the next. In fact, survival mode should only be reserved for those periods when uncontrollable external forces conspire to create a substantial impact to business as usual.\n\nYou know, like a global pandemic that threatens to take down entire economies.\n\nBut I\u2019ll save how to do survival mode for another post. Because even when external circumstances dictate that a startup go into survival mode, every day that startup remains in survival mode brings it another day closer to failure.\n\nIf a startup isn\u2019t growing, it\u2019s dying. So you should be thinking, planning, and acting in growth mode all the time. Here\u2019s how to transition your company up and out of the muck.\n\nThe moment of truth is CAC and LTV\n\nIt\u2019s said that if you want to create a successful business, find something you do well at low costs and high margins and repeat it over and over until something stops your progress. This is true. This is much easier said than done. And it\u2019s nothing that you can just luck or viral your way into.\n\nOne of the companies I\u2019m advising hit their growth moment of truth last week. It was a moment we had been chasing for the better part of six months, and it came to fruition when they put real numbers for Cost to Aquire a Customer (CAC) and initial Lifetime Value (LTV) into a spreadsheet.\n\nThis is the first step on the path to growth mode.\n\nTheir CAC data covered every part of addressing their market, from various marketing channels to conversions to onboarding. They had rows and rows of data for each path to closing the sale \u2014 from optimal and desirable paths to costly and clunky paths \u2014 and the true costs associated with each.\n\nTheir LTV data addressed each of their tiers of service, their churn, and what they could project moving forward. They threw out all the outliers \u2014 the freemiums, the VIPs, the beta testers \u2014 until they were working with real, defendable dollar figures.\n\nI should mention that those numbers sucked. High CAC, low LTV. But that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s like stepping on a scale for the first time in a long time. Those first few pounds are the easiest to lose.\n\nThe growth levers are found between CAC and LTV\n\nThe reason that CAC and LTV spreadsheet was a watershed moment is because now the company is no longer throwing darts. Instead of having to randomly decide which features and initiatives to prioritize, they can now create levers to reduce CAC and increase LTV.\n\nSo imagine they put CAC on the left of a whiteboard and LTV on the right. Those levers are going to be created in that white space in the middle. And they\u2019re going to be created by providing the kind of value that minimizes CAC for those customers with the highest LTV.\n\nLow cost, high margins, repeat.\n\nNow, if I could tell you exactly what features and initiatives you need to build to do that, I\u2019d be your CEO. However, I can give you the guidelines that you should be building those features and initiatives around.\n\nGet to the levers\n\nThe first step is to connect CAC to LTV, and that\u2019s going to require some assumptions and some research.\n\nFor example, your cheapest-to-acquire customers might not be your best customers. They may be costly to onboard and maintain, they may not value your product or service, and all that in turn may dramatically lower their LTV.\n\nTime to acquire is also a factor. For example, viral and word-of-mouth customers may be super cheap to acquire, but reaching a critical mass of these customers is the kind of time-based math that a lot of would-be entrepreneurs never consider. A company has to maintain an infrastructure to serve its customers and also needs to be able to take advantage of economies of scale. So there\u2019s a natural break-even point of customers-over-time for the business.\n\nDraw lines from CAC paths to a unique LTV for each path, then break that LTV out annually or even monthly, and multiply it by the number of those customers you can close in a month. Then target the most profitable customers you can acquire the quickest.\n\nPull the growth levers by delivering consistent, lasting value quickly\n\nNow that you\u2019ve targeted your initial market, to need to serve their needs, so you start with this question:\n\nHow quickly can we deliver consistent value that is lasting?\n\nEvery choice you make from your feature set down to your customer messaging should answer that question. These are your levers.\n\nQuickly: The first thing we did after connecting CAC to LTV was throw out all the metrics that didn\u2019t impact either of those things. The next thing we did was start tracking the time it took to get to each step on those paths.\n\nThe first thing we did after connecting CAC to LTV was throw out all the metrics that didn\u2019t impact either of those things. The next thing we did was start tracking the time it took to get to each step on those paths. Consistent: We started tracking functional areas of the product to determine where the most customers spent the most time, in terms of frequency. If there was a function the customers kept coming back to, that function became a priority, because there was value.\n\nWe started tracking functional areas of the product to determine where the most customers spent the most time, in terms of frequency. If there was a function the customers kept coming back to, that function became a priority, because there was value. Lasting: For those areas that saw repeat visits, we measured how long in between visits and over how much time. The functions that the customers came back to regularly over long periods became a top priority, because there was lasting value.\n\nMinimize CAC, Maximize LTV, then expand\n\nSomething will always stop your progress, even if that something is just saturation of the initial market. So you always need to prepare for what\u2019s next.\n\nIf you\u2019ve minimized CAC, maximized LTV, and found those paths to deliver consistent, lasting value to customers quickly, you should have received plenty of clues along the way of where your next best market might be.\n\nThere are many ways you can expand your market, but usually that expansion will run along one of these axes:\n\nTier: From the product out, you can dive deeper into certain functions or add new, related functions. Getting more money out of existing customers is always a good idea, even if the results may be limited. Less market share, more revenue per customer.\n\nFrom the product out, you can dive deeper into certain functions or add new, related functions. Getting more money out of existing customers is always a good idea, even if the results may be limited. Less market share, more revenue per customer. Market: Expand the definition of your customer to the next closest type. Instead of tweaking to give the same customers more functionality, you\u2019re tweaking to serve more customers with the same functionality.\n\nExpand the definition of your customer to the next closest type. Instead of tweaking to give the same customers more functionality, you\u2019re tweaking to serve more customers with the same functionality. Location: For some types of business, especially services, you can essentially double your customers by bringing the same value to a different local or regional market.\n\nThe important thing to remember when expanding is to crawl before you walk before you run. A lot of successful startups derail themselves by diving headfirst into a new market and not anticipating that every single market will be slightly to drastically different from the market they\u2019re dominating.\n\nDip a toe in first, check the temperature, then land and expand.\n\nHey!

        "text": "How Much Does It Cost To Create A Diet and Nutrition App (Features, Business Model, Cost etc) Sophia Martin Follow Dec 10 \u00b7 11 min read\n\nAre you planning to develop a diet and nutrition app in 2020\u201321? Not sure how much it cost you to develop a brilliant diet and nutrition tracking app with MVP? Many of the developers can assure you to develop it under $5000!\n\nIsn\u2019t it too good to believe?\n\nAccording to the survey, the median development cost range is in between $37,913 and $171,450, but it could climb up to $50,000 or higher depending upon the various factors.\n\nBut, with the fact that mobile healthcare apps are projected to generate $50,000+ revenue and value by 2025 and 74% of patients are using wearable and other healthcare tools to cope up with their medical conditions.

In addition, the time and cost of creating these features are rough estimations, as it greatly varies according to the team or software development company you choose to hire for the project.\n\nWhat is The Process of Developing Modern Diet and Nutrition App In 2020\u201321?\n\nIf you have finally made a decision to move ahead with Diet and Nutrition app development, then you need to have a clear perspective and a strategic plan to achieve success.\n\nSo let\u2019s begin with the steps that can help you build a diet and nutrition mobile app:\n\n1. Research, Plan and Developing a Roadmap\n\nConsidering the facts and figures of progressive diet and nutrition app market, it is a worthy decision to make an investment. But before investing your time and money, it is important to analyze the market and evaluate your app development idea accordingly.\n\nSo to make a clear plan and functional roadmap about your development process, make sure it should include:\n\nThe idea of launching the app\n\nWho will be your targeted audience?\n\nWhat will be your development plan?\n\nWhat are you trying to achieve through this app development?\n\nHow will you make a profit from the app?\n\nOnce you find answers to these questions, you can move ahead to the other part.\n\n2. Choice of Operating System\n\nBefore you roll out the UX/UI design of the app, it is important to decide whether you want to develop a Native or Cross-platform application? The choice of OS greatly depends upon your targeted audience, as it is a well-known fact that iOS devices are used by rich people, whereas Android devices are preferred by ordinary middle-class people.\n\nMoreover, iOS users have the power to purchase the app, whereas Android users are habitual to use free apps. But with the launch of a cross-platform application, you can reach out to a wider market and be able to save a great cost on app development.\n\nThere are many open-source frameworks, tools and technologies that you can use to develop Diet and Nutrition apps such as Flutter. Despite being a young and newly launched framework, Flutter has secured its position in the 2nd most popular and widely used frameworks. By leveraging its features and wide pool of plugins, you can customize the app with the best UX/UI design.\n\n3. UX/UI Design\n\nSince every app store has its own guidelines, therefore you need to customize the UX/UI design of the app accordingly. However, don\u2019t forget that app design is the most important element of your development process, so make sure it should be interactive, intuitive, and engaging. To develop a highly simple and unique app design, it is best to hire a dedicated UX/UI designer that helps you finalize a wireframe and the UI design based on your needs.\n\n4. App Development\n\nThe development phase would involve working with the app development team that can understand your requirement and have skills to go above and beyond your requirements to deliver result-oriented solutions. All the features will be coded by the developers and made it functional with the UI design as a base. To make your app successful, all you need a mobile app development company to ensure your best results from the development solution.\n\n5. App Testing and Quality Assurance\n\nOnce you are done with the development process, its time to test every single element of the app by running it over multiple platforms to ensure seamless user experience. The main goal of hiring the app tester is to eliminate the bugs and ensure that your app works flawlessly in various situations.\n\nCost To Develop Diet and Nutrition App in 2020\u201321:\n\nWhile it is hard to estimate the exact cost of the app development as it greatly varies on multiple factors right from the development team you hire to the features and functionalities, app complexity, and more. Still, with the close evaluation of each factor, there is a scope of determining the real estimation of the app development. However, on an average, you can develop a Diet and Nutrition app with MVP from $10,000+.\n\nBut, being an IT expert, we always recommend getting in touch with the nutrition app development company that provides you with a complete development team under one roof including:\n\nProject manager\n\nUX/UI Designer\n\nDeveloper\n\nBackend/ Frontend developer\n\nApp Tester\n\nAndroid/ iOS Developer\n\nThe cost to hire a development team can be starting from $25/hr in India, $100/hr in the USA and $150/hr in the UK, depending upon location of the development team, skills and experience of the programmers.\n\nConclusion\n\nUndoubtedly, Diet and Nutrition based apps are steadily growing in popularity and opening a plethora of opportunities for the startups and entrepreneurs in 2020\u201321.\n\nWhile using these apps, you can keep yourself fit and healthy with constant monitoring of physical activities and food intake. In addition, these apps offer everything in one place right from keeping track of your calories in-take to getting connected with the fitness experts, providing healthy in-app recipes to getting a personalized workout regime, a strategically developed app can provide you with all such things.",

        "title": "How To Write A Clickable Headline",
        "text": "My highest earning article originally had around 10 views. It was a pretty dismal result. And this remained like that for a couple of weeks. I knew the content within the article itself was good. I\u2019d been so proud of it that I\u2019d rushed my way through to completion \u2014 dodgy headline and all. So I decided to tweak it \u2014 I rewrote the title about 20 times until I landed on one that felt right. Once updated, the clicks came pouring in, and that article ended up paying for 30% of my Europe trip.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt about it \u2014 your headline is the most important part of your article. It doesn\u2019t matter if the actual content of your article is a true masterpiece or complete drivel if no one even clicks through to it in the first place. You have to lure them in first.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve written several very average (if not below average) headlines. And I always suffer the consequences. Tweaking headlines of ill-performing articles has been a gamechanger for me, as mentioned above. Learning what works and what doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ve found even the tiniest changes have the biggest impacts on clickthrough rates.\n\nAlthough I strongly believe that rules are made to broken, there are certain rules that have come into play for a reason.\n\nBelow are 6 ways to help your headline become more clickable, tried and tested by myself and thousands of others.\n\n1. First & Last Words\n\nReaders will commonly only read the first word and the last three words of your title if they are skimming, but the first word is the most important.\n\nWhen people are faced with an abundance of content and multiple headlines are calling for their attention, they\u2019re most likely going to skim each title. Their mind is wired to find those keywords that peak their interests and tastes.\n\nWith this in mind, I personally like to begin my articles with how, why or what. It creates a sense of intrigue and lets the reader know that I might be able to help them with something. I do, however, still struggle with my addiction of starting a title with the word \u201cSo\u2026\u201d but I\u2019m only human.\n\nI also try and put the main, key word in the last three words of the title \u2014 for me, it\u2019s usually something pertaining to writing, productivity, grief or weight.\n\nThis is usually the word that will get the reader to enter your realm. Don\u2019t leave this out.\n\n2. Keep It Short (Just Not Too Short)\n\nIt\u2019s commonly said that the ideal length of a title is 6 words (with titles of 6 words earning the highest number of click-throughs).\n\nOf course, every rule has it\u2019s exceptions but try to keep your titles under 10 words.\n\nToo short, and it won\u2019t be easy to search. Too long, and people won\u2019t bother reading or they will struggle to understand \u2014 especially when they\u2019re just skimming.\n\n3. Add Some Emotional Benefits\n\nA title which says to the reader, \u201cHey, I can help you with this particular part of your life, come read me\u201d is going to get a higher level of clicks.\n\nWhether you\u2019re appealing to fear, curiosity, romance or another shared human experience, try and make your title call out the emotional benefit that will come to the reader if read (if the article calls for it, of course).\n\nBelow are some articles with great titles that I\u2019ve recently enjoyed from Medium users. All of these titles promote an emotional benefit:\n\nYou Aren\u2019t Supposed to Like the Person You Used to Be by Brianna Wiest\n\nEmotional benefits: Feeling understood, allowing yourself to grow.\n\nYou\u2019re Not Lazy \u2014 Self-Isolation is Utterly Exhausting by Gillian Sisley\n\nEmotional benefits: Permission to cut yourself some slack. Comfort of a shared human experience.\n\n10 Quotes That Will Help You Stay Calm During Hard Times by Sinem G\u00fcnel\n\nEmotional benefits: A state of calm and comfort.\n\nHow to Finally Finish Your Creative Projects by Eileen Pollack\n\nEmotional benefits: Motivation and inspiration. A sense of accomplishment.\n\n7 Essential Money Lessons from \u2018The Wealthy Gardener\u2019 by Sergey Faldin\n\nEmotional benefits: Feeling wealthy or financially secure.\n\n4. Keep It Simple\n\nEveryone loves beautiful prose, but your headline is rarely the time to experiment with it.\n\nAvoid abstract and mysterious titles, because although they may seem clever once the reader has finished reading your entire piece\u2026 it\u2019s highly unlikely that the reader will even click through to it in the first place. And your well thought-out title will go to waste, anyway.\n\nMake sure that your title sums up exactly what your article is about. Let the reader know what they are going to learn or read about. Save the riddles for another time.\n\n5. Write More Than One\n\nDon\u2019t just go with the first headline that comes to mind. Try and write at least 10, if not 20.\n\nI know this may seem excessive but each different headline will make it clearer to you as to what is working and what isn\u2019t. It may seem like a lot of effort for a few words, but those words are vital.\n\nWhy bother writing a 1000 word article only to let yourself down with the final 6 words?\n\nWhen it comes to a great headline, you\u2019ll know it when you see it. Write as many as you can, and then go with your gut.\n\n6. Learn From Others\n\nI\u2019ll often see an article that I can\u2019t click on fast enough. Maybe it struck an emotional chord. Maybe it seemed to pertain information relevant or of interest to me. Usually it\u2019s because I\u2019m in need of some inspiration or motivation (I\u2019m a sucker for self improvement and how-to articles).\n\nWhatever it is that makes you click on a title like your life depends on it, make sure you write it down. Anytime a headline really excites you, record it.\n\nAnalyse your list every now and then, and see if they have anything in common. What makes them clickable to you will also make them clickable to others too.\n\n7. Use Numbers\n\nUnless you\u2019re a hater of listicles (how DARE you, and why are you here?), this tip will make sense to you. I know it rings true for me \u2014 they\u2019re what I love to read and what I love to write.\n\nThey\u2019re easy for the brain to process, and they\u2019re usually easy for the reader to skim parts that are relevant to them. When a reader sees numbers in your title, they will feel assured that your article will be easy to comprehend and digest.\n\n\u201cNumbers work well in headlines because humans like predictability and dislike uncertainty,\u201d says Buffer\u2019s Courtney Seiter.",

        "title": "The Neuroscience of Slowing Down to Accomplish More",
        "text": "The Neuroscience of Slowing Down to Accomplish More\n\nRushing is a false economy\n\nPhoto by Chinmay Singh from Pexels\n\nWhen I was little, my grandmother always told me, \u201cLess haste, more speed.\u201d\n\nI really didn\u2019t get what she was trying to tell me. On first hearing it, I thought it was a contradiction to state that less going fast actually meant more going fast \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the difference between haste and speed.\n\nBut then I was the kind of kid that did everything at 100 miles per hour, and that was something I took into adulthood with me.\n\nIn my first career in the hospitality industry, I was always rushing, and I was always super stressed. I had a team of staff underneath me, but I hated delegating, stuck in my belief that if you wanted something done right then you needed to do it yourself.\n\nI left that industry aged 29, exhausted and desperate for change in my life.\n\nI learned better\n\nWhen I decided on a career change and went to University, I studied Cognitive Neuroscience. I began to learn so much that explained who I was as a person, and why I had been so stressed and depleted in my first career.\n\nKnowing what I had been doing to my brain, I had to change my approach.\n\nExecutive function is what separates us from the animals\n\nOur \u2018executive functions\u2019 are those more complex thought processes, like planning for the future and thinking in an abstract way. These executive functions separate us from the other mammals.\n\nWhen I was organizing the catering for big events, I was using a lot of planning and logistical thinking, and this was really quite tiring. Our working memory is a part of our executive functions, which are all associated with the prefrontal cortex.\n\nWorking memory capacity\n\nAs far as studies can tell, our working memory has a very finite capacity. It has long been understood that the average person can hold 7 items (problems or things to remember) in their working memory, with an average variation of -2 or +2.\n\nSo to put that in simple terms; if you are trying to remember a few things to do later, while considering a couple of logistical issues, and then your phone rings and somebody needs you \u2014 your working memory is now maxed out and you can\u2019t handle anything else.\n\nWhy am I sharing this?\n\nPut simply, when your working memory is at full capacity, the effect on your cognition is similar to having too many browser tabs open on your laptop. Things start to slow down and your system becomes less efficient \u2014 maybe even overwhelmed.\n\nWhen we try to do too much at once, typically in a bid to save time, we end up depleting our reserves, slowing us down in the long run.\n\nWe can sustain only very short bursts of this intense kind of working and thinking. If you\u2019ve ever worked in the events industry then you will know the feeling of exhaustion after working a busy event. It\u2019s almost like an \u2018energy hangover\u2019 for the next few days.\n\nBut if you want to achieve more over a sustained period of time, then the science-backed advice is to keep things simple and not try to pack everything in at once.\n\nAnd if you need to be warned about the pitfalls of multi tasking, then check out this story on task switching and focus.\n\nA simple hack to protect your working memory\n\nWith all of the above said, if you do find that you need to think about multiple problems or juggle multiple tasks at once, then there is a really simple way to help your brain conserve energy.\n\nWrite everything down. Yes, it\u2019s that simple. When your working memory is getting near capacity, in order to shut down some of those \u2018browser windows\u2019 and retain more brain power \u2014 simply empty out whatever you were trying to remember for later.\n\nWhen you write down your to-do list, or problems to solve list, and focus on one task or problem at a time, your working memory is now running at 100% efficiency again.\n\nIt sounds too simple to be true, but don\u2019t trust me, trust the data. Studies like this one have even shown an additional boost to our working memory capacity can be achieved by writing expressively, which is perfect if you are under stress and need to decompress a little.\n\nBreaks and brainpower\n\nPossibly one of the worst things we do to ourselves is to not take adequate breaks during the day.\n\nThe hustle culture is so ingrained in us, that we feel guilty for taking the time that our brain needs to recharge and reset.\n\nI used to be guilty of this. At my worst I would take my phone into the bathroom and read my emails or write social posts while I was \u2018otherwise occupied\u2019 (on the toilet).\n\nSure, it\u2019s laugh-worthy now. But at the time I truly wouldn\u2019t give myself a few minutes off.\n\nSome studies show that more frequent short breaks, with some stretching or movement, are most favourable for people working or learning at desks all day. This certainly benefits the body and mind as a whole, and neuroscience backs this too.\n\nI know that when you are on a mission to achieve in life, then it is tempting to rush through your tasks and cram more work into every day. But the evidence is stacked against this approach.\n\nPacing yourself, and respecting the fact that you are a human being with biological needs such as rest and fuel, gives you the best shot at accomplishing more in the long term.\n\nDon\u2019t push yourself to the point of burnout, there has been enough of that in the world lately. It is time to be smart about how we treat our brains and our bodies, and to start thriving in our work.",

        "text": "Not Taking Marketing Seriously Taught Me a Bitter Lesson in my Entrepreneur Journey\n\nIf there was one thing I could tell my early entrepreneur self\u2026\n\nPhoto by Diggity Marketing on Unsplash\n\nIf there was one thing I could tell my early entrepreneur self, it is most definitely \u201cto have a marketing plan.\u201d\n\nI learned the hard way that not having a marketing and plan and not having a business plan that does not prioritize marketing is a futile attempt at entrepreneurship, delivering no possible outcome.\n\nSo here is how it all started!\n\nAttempt #1\n\nAt the time I started my first venture, I had a decent knowledge of iOS development and a little bit of UI/UX design.\n\nDuring that time, businesses were booming, and there were plenty of new small businesses starting up. With the digital surge, I figured that there was potential for our product in the market.\n\nSo I did what every early entrepreneur would have done. Come up with a great business plan (at least what looked like something great at the time), partnered up with a few colleagues as partners that shared common interests, and established a business presence.\n\nAfter all this, I used all my skills to make a classy website to get a great first impression.\n\nWith every step along the way ticked off from the list, we expected clients to be at our doorstep the next day.\n\nBut the clients never came.\n\nSo, we waited for a week. The week later became a few weeks.\n\nThe clients never came.\n\nSo, where did we go wrong?\n\nWe thought we had a great business proposition on our hands and that we can solve one of the major problems that small businesses face when digitizing their operations.\n\nBut, it did not seem to go our way, and that was the end of the first attempt at entrepreneurship.\n\nSo, we went back to the drawing board to see what went wrong. After a few Google searches, we figured that we were not alone.\n\nAlthough we had a marketing plan listed on our business plan, I did not put too much effort into the matter and focused on the other details.\n\nIt was my biggest mistake!\n\nThe next day was the first day of attempt #2. This time, marketing was not an appendix but the whole thing.\n\nWhy is marketing that important?\n\nAt the beginning of a new venture, brand awareness is non-existent or at a bare minimum level. Nobody knows about the capabilities unless you tell them.\n\nWe needed to inform our target market about the great product we had and why they need to get on board with us \u2014 something we failed at first.\n\nBut now, we made sure to tick this, and we came up with and included a \u201cMarketing First\u201d approach to get started.\n\nHere are three strategies we incorporated into our marketing plan to get our business off the ground.\n\n1 \u2014 Established an identity for the company\n\nOne of the things that we vaguely focused on was branding and limited the branding idea just to the logos and colors.\n\nWhat we did right in the second was to go beyond the logo and colors but to look at branding and bring out our core values and company goals in the process.\n\nThat helped us get through to the target segment effortlessly.\n\n2 \u2014 Customer first\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes we committed in our early attempt was not understanding our target market and what they wanted.\n\nWe were all over the park targeting a massive audience, whereas an effective, well-thought strategy would have guaranteed our word to reach our prospective leads.\n\nWe then narrowed our promotions and targeting to our niche.\n\nWe targeted small to medium business owners that did not already have a mobile application or a decent website in and around Europe.\n\nThere was one other thing we did. We reached out to our prospects to see what they lack. This way, we identified that most of these businesses also wanted assistance in getting their social media presence established.\n\nSo we coupled our offering to include the aspect of social media so that it suits our target market better. While we were passionate about design and app development, there were other needs in the market.\n\nThus, we made amends to our plan to bring in expertise, and this way fulfilled this need.\n\nUnderstanding what our target market wants was a good starting point for us to see what options to investigate and what to drop off.\n\nThis way, we generated a lot of value for our target audience, later leading to sales.\n\n3 \u2014 Entry strategy\n\nExcept for a few exceptions, there are already established players across every market and industry.\n\nTo compete in a saturated market, a startup needs to find the gaps in the market that are not fulfilled by the existing establishments.\n\nFor my startup idea, that was what we did when we appealed to the SMEs. Instead of going all out like the first option, we did our market research to find out what were the gaps in the current system and how we can work to fulfill them.\n\nThese businesses did not have too much to spend, and that did not fit into the established firms whose price points started way above the budgets of these companies.\n\nSo we attacked this opportunity to onboard all these clients and provided them with an economical yet quality solution.\n\nThe solution later snowballed into something bigger, thanks to recommendations from our first clients based on the exceptional service we offered.\n\nWhat we understood is that despite established saturated markets, there is always space for a new entrant if you do your market research and find out what is lacking or missed by the big players.\n\nMost entrepreneurs go head first with the established companies, and it often leads to burnout.\n\nRather than that, it is good to attack the gaps that go unfulfilled and later make your way to fight the big players.",

        "title": "What\u2019s Going on with the Flu?",
        "text": "In January 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, warned of the potentially long and harsh flu season. At that time, the B strain, normally showing up in February or March, began months earlier. The flu season in 2019\u20132020 was expected to be one of the worst seasons in decades (\u201c2019\u20132020 Flu Season\u2026,\u201d 2020).\n\nIn week five of 2020 (late January), the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported 21,773 new positive tests of the flu (types A and B combined) in the U.S. In comparison, the same week the prior year had only 10,879. There were more than double the number of flu cases nationally compared with the year before (CDC, 2020).\n\nThat was around the same time when the WHO declared a global health emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic. A day later President Trump restricted travel from China to help stop the global spread of COVID-19 (Taylor 2020). Americans were told to change some of their practices to help prevent the spread of this new novel virus.\n\nLess than a month later, Italy began to see an increase in coronavirus cases. By the end of February, the U.S. reported the first known death from COVID-19. We were being told to wash our hands and wipe down surfaces by scientists.\n\nMasks were in short supply, so it wasn\u2019t easy to buy them and States had not yet mandated wearing them in public. Even so, flu numbers started to decline slowly, probably due to a better awareness of handwashing. By the first week in March, CDC reported a 33% decrease in positive flu tests (A & B strains combined). The previous year's flu season saw a 20% increase in positive tests over the same period.\n\nOn March 13, President Trump declared a national emergency in response to rising cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. (Taylor 2020). Schools were canceled, sports were canceled, businesses closed. That week, positive tests for A and B flu strains dropped again to just over 5,000 nationally. This represented a 74% drop from the season\u2019s peak.\n\nWhen states began issuing orders to stay at home, the number of positive flu cases dropped again, as expected. The week of April 20, 2020, there were only 28 reported positive tests of influenza A & B. By August, less than ten cases per week were reported.\n\nBelow is a graph representing positive tests reported to the CDC of both A and B flu strains combined. You can see what happened with flu numbers when more extreme measures were taken to deal with the spread of COVID-19:\n\nWhy the sudden decline?\n\nAlthough both the flu and COVID-19 are transmitted through droplets produced from coughing, sneezing, or even talking, COVID-19 is more infectious. This is likely because, in addition to spreading through droplets, COVID-19 can be airborne \u2014 spread in tiny droplets that remain in the air for much longer (Maragakis, 2020).\n\nAdditionally, influenza has a shorter incubation period and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases), according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAs a consequence, our behavioral changes to help lessen the spread of coronavirus have also decreased the spread of the flu \u2014 perhaps even more effectively. Hand washing, social distancing, and wearing masks seem to be effective in preventing the spread of both illnesses.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we should skip our flu shots, however. Although the two illnesses share some symptoms, the way they infect the body is different. Scientists are still unsure whether the outcomes of having both simultaneously will lead to extreme outcomes (Broadfoot, 2020). It isn\u2019t worth finding out the hard way.\n\nIn short, what is happening to the flu is a nugget of good news. Fingers crossed our diligence with preventing the spread of COVID-19 will continue to suppress influenza numbers as we head into the 2020\u20132021 flu season. We certainly don\u2019t need one more thing to add to the calamity of 2020.\n\nNote: I love hearing your comments.

        "title": "Who Hears the Salmon When They Cry?",
        "text": "\u201cThis creature known as man is of course highly intelligent, he is capable of manufacturing almost anything from rumors to test-tube babies and yet he destroys two or three species every day. This is the absurdity of man.\u201d \u2014 Gao Xingjian, Soul Mountain\n\nThe largest salmon run in the world takes place in the rivers of Bristol Bay in southwest Alaska. Every year, an average of 36.9 million sockeye salmon enter Bristol Bay and race upriver to return to their birthplace. The watershed is also spawning ground for all Pacific salmon species \u2013 chinook, coho, chum and pink.\n\nSalmon is a keystone species in the Pacific Northwest, having a disproportionately large effect on its natural environment. Many species depend on salmon for survival, including brown bears, bald eagles, orcas, or otters.\n\nOn days when salmons are migrating, a dominant brown bear in the Katmai National Park can catch more than 40 fish per day by simply standing at the edge of a cascade. A sockeye salmon contains approximately 4,500 calories, but the fatty parts like the eggs, brain, and skin are more energy-dense. When there is an abundance of fish, bears are practicing good energy economics by eating only the fattiest parts, a behaviour known as high-grading.\n\nAccording to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the 2018 sockeye salmon run of 62.3 million fish was the largest on record dating back to 1893 and was 69% above the 20-year average. With a run of 58.2 million salmon, 2020 was the sixth consecutive year that the sockeye salmon run exceeded 50 million fish.\n\nWith record salmon runs, it is tempting to believe that all is well in Bristol Bay\u2019s rivers, but this could not be farther from the truth. The greatest fishery in the world is indeed facing significant threats.\n\nNorthern Dynasty Minerals owns 100% of the Pebble Project, the world\u2019s largest undeveloped copper, gold, molybdenum, and silver deposit. The mining project is located at the Kvichak and Nushagak rivers\u2019 headwaters, two of the most productive salmon rivers flowing into Bristol Bay.\n\nDisputes over the Pebble project have been ongoing for more than a decade. The mining project was rejected under the Obama administration but found new life under the Trump administration. On November 25, The Army Corps of Engineers denied an essential permit required under the federal Clean Water Act, but the company confirmed that it would appeal the decision.\n\nNorthern Dynasty Minerals and its management continue to believe that the Pebble project\u2019s construction is in the public\u2019s interest. Obviously, their financial interests are clouding their judgement. The possibility of damaging the pristine wilderness and one of the most productive marine ecosystems in North America is not in the public\u2019s interest.\n\nThe story of the Pebble project reveals the inability of a capitalist system to value natural ecosystems properly. In economic terms, the destruction of the rich wilderness surrounding Bristol Bay would be a mere externality. The risk of environmental damage would not be included in the production costs or in the final price of the ore sold on international markets. It would be another example of privatizing profits and socializing losses, the definition of a subsidy.\n\nWith a capitalist mindset, Bristol Bay\u2019s value would be the present value of its free cash flows. In that framework, Bristol Bay\u2019s value would depend on the number of wild salmon that could later be sold to supermarkets.\n\nThe fact that such a narrow framework blinds many corporate executives is distressing and is the root cause of many problems humanity is facing today. Why is it so difficult to understand that the value of Bristol Bay is its sole existence? Why do wild species of salmon, bears, orcas and eagles have to justify their presence in monetary terms? Why do we impose such a narrow operating framework on the natural world?\n\nOur attitude toward the natural world reveals entrenched anthropocentrism, a belief that human beings are at the center of the universe. This single concept, which is now widespread, is an existential threat. It is self-evident that no species in the biosphere operate in a vacuum, and obviously, Homo Sapiens is also subject to those interdependences.\n\n\u201cThe Europeans and European Americans surveyed the landscape of North America and saw commodities. Forest were timber that could be sold. The animals that lived there had thick and valuable fur that could be sold. Land could be used to grow food products to be sold. Fish could be salted or packed in cans and sold. The minerals in the earth could be dug up or washed out and sold.\u201d \u2014 Mark Kurlansky, Salmon, A Fish, the Earth, and the History of Their Common Fate, Page 194\n\nThe direct environmental risks brought by the Pebble project are worrisome, but there are much more significant and indirect threats on the horizon. In this case, the environmental threats are not created by a single mining corporation operating in the vicinity of prolific spawning grounds but from an aggregation of billions of daily individual decisions made worldwide.\n\nAccording to the Independent Scientific Group, the optimal water temperature for salmonid spawning is 10\u00b0C, and stressful conditions begin at temperatures greater than 15.6\u00b0C, with lethal effects at 21\u00b0C and above.\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Arctic\u2019s air temperatures have been warming at approximately twice the rate of the rest of the world. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2020 was the second warmest year on record in the Arctic and continued a 7-year long streak of the warmest temperatures recorded since 1900.\n\nThe summer of 2019 re-wrote the record books for Alaska, where air temperatures broke records. On July 4, record temperatures were recorded in Kenai, Palmer, King Salmon, and Anchorage International Airport, where it reached 32.2\u00b0C or 2.8\u00b0C higher than the previous record. In Anchorage, the temperature was higher than 21.1\u00b0C for 17 consecutive days and higher than 26.7\u00b0C for six straight days.\n\nThe heatwave was associated with the death of tens of thousands of pre-spawned salmons. Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen and increases salmon\u2019s metabolism. It creates a double whammy effect as salmons need more oxygen at a moment when less of it is dissolved in the water. According to Chris Sergeant, a scientist at the University of Montana, warm water combined with a dense population of salmon can lead to mass suffocation, as seen in the video below. With continued warming in the Arctic, mass salmon die-off will become more frequent and more severe.\n\nWarmer water temperature favours the growth and the survival of young smolts, and it might explain the record runs of the last few years. However, this is a non-linear system, and above a certain threshold, warmer water temperature ceases to be favourable and becomes lethal.\n\nAll is not well in Bristol Bay, and it is likely to get worst. The Shifting Baseline Syndrome stipulates that people\u2019s accepted thresholds for environmental conditions are continually lowered due to ongoing environmental degradation. With no past experiences, we tend to forget how rich Earth was before the mass destruction that has been going on for centuries.\n\nUnfortunately, the best way to convey Bristol Bay\u2019s richness to future generations might be through books, not by going to the river banks. However, with the current rate of warming in the Arctic, the risk of losing Bristol Bay might become the least of our concerns. Warming in the Arctic is creating much bigger problems, and the impact on salmon is only one of the often forgotten consequences.\n\nIf you are also worried, please share it with your friends. Together, we might be able to make a difference. Inaction is part of the problem.",

        "text": "The Reserve Bucket\n\nand why you should hold on to that lame ass story you wrote\n\nI don\u2019t want to write a book or a novel. It\u2019s never been my goal. I have the attention span of a bouncy ball, or a drunk person who keeps forgetting they were in search of a public restroom. Sure I can write 50,000 to 80,000 words, just not on the same subject at one time. Maybe at some point I\u2019ll consider publishing a collection of essays, but for now I\u2019ll stick with writing and publishing those essays as standalones.\n\nThere are times I\u2019ve fallen short or felt creatively drained when \u201cFuck it\u201d feels the best route to take. Other times I could write three stories a day, swiftly and with grace, and at times I\u2019m even willing to lose sleep to keep the groove going. I utilized both as the positive and negative they are.\n\nI discovered this thing I\u2019ve come to call my reserve bucket. It\u2019s sort of a never empty bucket of stories and articles. It\u2019s never ending because you regularly take stories out and put stories in.\n\nAs writers we\u2019re going to come up with just as many bad ideas as we do good. We\u2019ll write as many shit stories as we do perfect stories. It\u2019s a legitimate part of the writing process. There are aspects and loopholes and all sorts of #lifehappens we weren\u2019t prepared for, but we were prepared to keep our writing career rolling, no matter what, with our reserve bucket.\n\nThe definition of a writer is not to just sit down, pump out a story and poof our job is done for the day. That\u2019s not how being a writer works at all, no. Just, no.\n\nIn a sense being a writer is similar to a plague. It\u2019s 24/7/365. Generating ideas never stops nor does our power of observation. It\u2019s more like; Dear lord, please let me take this train ride into the city without a single realization that, whoa, I just had an idea! This is the real deal. The reality of writing, writer, write. It\u2019s a process that never ends.\n\nThere are three #major #valuable #important reasons why every writer should have a reserve bucket of stories and articles.",

        "title": "Simplifying Dependency Injection and IoC Concepts using TypeScript",
        "text": "But first, let us set the table straight. If you have noticed any top class restaurant\u2019s kitchen operation then you will find this article\u2019s motivation a bit similar. In a restaurant, each Station Chef is responsible for running a specific section of the kitchen and they are being managed directly by the Head Chef or by the second-in-command Sous Chef. Station chefs can be in charge of different things respectively. A list of station chefs includes but is not limited to butcher chef, fish chef, grill chef, pantry chef, etc.\n\nWhenever one order comes to the kitchen via a Caller, the Sous Chef simply doesn\u2019t start preparing it all by himself. He runs down what are the things he needs to deliver, and start instructing them accordingly to each Station Chef. He expects they would handover their prepared items on a common table, where the entire dish can then be prepared or garnished for serving. This is an important takeaway that we will soon find out in this article but before that here is a rundown of the topics you will get introduced in this article.\n\n- Dependency Injection\n\n- Dependency Inversion Principle\n\n- Inversion of Control\n\n- Inversion of Control Container\n\n- TypeScript Interfaces\n\n- Decorator Functions\n\n- Reflection APIs\n\n- TypeScript IoC\n\nProblem Statement\n\nLet\u2019s present a problem we are going to recreate and solve, called \u201cPizza making chronicles\u201d.\n\nI made this comic strip using Pixton. It is a cool app, do check out!\n\nPizza making got several dependencies to start with. Ignoring cheese and toppings (even sauce) for simplicity, we can see that pizza needs dough and dough needs flour and yeast. Flour and Yeast need water. Water needs salt. Here is a directed graph diagram that roughly shows these dependencies:\n\nThe blue line shows the dependencies of dough.\n\nDependency Injection\n\nPizza needs dough to start with. Let\u2019s see how does that look in a typical code base.\n\nSoon we figure out that this Dough class is also required for making bread, so its redundant to allow both Pizza and Bread to be in charge of Dough all by themselves. So let\u2019s delegate the creation of Dough to someone else. We inject the dependency Dough in Pizza constructor, an example of the most famous constructor based Dependency Injection.\n\nHowever, we passed a concrete implementation of Dough in Pizza, called DoughEntity . But customers might order different types of dough for different pizzas later.\n\nDependency Inversion Principle\n\nSince dependency implementations can be swapped easily as they are injected during runtime, we rather inject an interface, like IDough so that we can later swap it with any concrete implementation of IDough , i.e DoughEntity like SourdoughDough , BriocheDough , ChallahDough , FocacciaDough etc.\n\nYou can read more about the benefits of having interface defining an action and other classes implementing the interface in another article of mine:\n\nWith dependency injections, we ensured that the chef making pizza can\u2019t make its own dough, and with dependency inversion principle we ensured that different kinds of dough can now be used for making pizza. Same goes for dough maker. Dough maker doesn\u2019t decide which flour and what kind of flour it will use rather it is handed to him by someone else in the charge of the pantry.\n\nThere is a slight problem with this pattern in applications. This might lead to a nested and complicated dependency graph because we keep manually initiating the dependencies and pass them up to the ones who need it. So what to do?\n\nInversion of Control\n\nIn software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a programming principle. IoC inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework.\n\nDependency Injection so far looked like this: The Caller needs a pizza and announces it in the kitchen. Pizza Chef doesn\u2019t make the dough himself, he asks it from the dough maker.\n\nBut imagine the dough maker now says, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me for the dough, I will keep my dough on a table when I am done myself.\u201d\n\nThere is a Hollywood Principle, which states:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Call Us, We\u2019ll Call You\u201d\n\nThis is what inversion of control looks like. The Pizza Chef doesn\u2019t directly gets the dough from the dough maker, rather he will get if from an external place without him having a knowledge of who or when it was exactly kept there.\n\nInversion of Control Container\n\nSo finally we have a kitchen table which contains the prepared items. Pizza chef takes everything from there when he needs it and starts making pizza. A programming container also behaves as such, which typically bind interfaces to implementations and serves them as dependencies when someone needs it. It will look something like this in the code.\n\nNow let\u2019s code the talk using TypeScript. The demo code is a NodeJS application build using Express framework. We will be using InversifyJS, an IoC container for TypeScript, in this project. Here are the dependencies used:\n\nI used lightweight InversifyJS to simply demonstrate how containers work in applications, and then it will be easier for us to understand how frameworks like Angular or Laravel uses DI and IoCs. You can check out the entire repository here:\n\nTypeScript Interfaces\n\nLet us create an interface called Dough . I don\u2019t like using IDough naming, so would name dough as Dough for the rest of the code.\n\nWe usually want to code using interfaces so that we have better consistency across classes, but in the generated JavaScript, we do not have any references for it. It is simply non-existent. So how can we use Dependency Injection in TypeScript?\n\nDecorator Functions\n\nFrameworks like Angular and NestJS use decorators, so to tell its own DI mechanism what are the dependencies other classes require and and how to initialise them.\n\nThese decorator functions basically add metadata to our classes. The metadata are used to gain information about what dependencies it needs during runtime and thus helps in resolving them.\n\nIn Inversify, whenever a class (it will always have @injectable decorators on them) have a dependency on an interface, we use the @inject decorator to define an identifier for the interface that will be available at runtime.\n\nReflection APIs\n\nReflection allows inspection and modification of a code base, including its own. Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript does support experimental reflection features, though few in number. Using metadata reflection API we can standardize how we achieve details of unknown objects during runtime.\n\nFor the class Pizza , when DoughEntity dependency is called, the Injectable Decorator adds a metadata entry for the property using the Reflect.metadata function from the reflect-metadata library, which gives us a array of dependencies that the class requires. It under the hood presents us with the right information about DoughEntity being a dependency for Pizza .\n\nHere is a simplified example of the metadata generated when we pass a concrete implementation. You can find this behaviour in NodeJS frameworks like NestJS, and its decorator usage .\n\nWe can see that the metadata points to exact DoughEntity . But what if we injected Dough interface?\n\nWhen the code transpiles to JavaScript, we get metadata as an Object , with no way for us to say which specific object it is. We need to do something to uniquely identify them so that during runtime the proper class is resolved.\n\nIn our demo code after having coded in the interfaces, we type-hint our real classes instead of interfaces. We use Symbol to allow identification of Dough interface with \u201cDough\u201d .\n\nLet\u2019s create a concrete implementation of Dough now and call it DoughEntity . Here you can see, we mentioned the class as injectable using @injectable decorator, and passed in interfaces in the constructor with @inject decorator so to define the identifiers.\n\nNow we create a container that binds the interfaces to their implementations such that if Dough types are called, we get concrete implementation of DoughEntity .\n\nWe create the Pizza class as following:\n\nBefore we do the rest of the code, here is a peek in to the future for better understanding. Since we are using decorators and reflection API, if we see the generated JavaScript code of pizza.class.ts by setting \u201cemitDecoratorMetadata\u201d: true in tsconfig.json , we could see that the Object we get in metadata will be of type Types.Dough .\n\nAnd the generated JavaScript code of dough.entity.ts would look like this, where param orders tell us about DoughEntity dependencies:\n\nIt surely seems that the decorators and reflection API have done its part in figuring out the dependency.\n\nAnd now the moment of truth, let\u2019s resolve a dependency here in the main.ts file and see it in action.\n\nIf we run the application and open the console, we can see the following output telling us the Dependency Injection worked using the IoC container.\n\nSalt gets initiated first. Water , Flour , Yeast and finally Dough classes were successfully resolved and finally got injected into the Pizza class.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPhoto by David Cain on Unsplash\n\nThere is a reason why good kitchens operate similar to this. A real chef can vouch about it more than me for sure. They can truly deliver the best when each of the chefs has singular, separate responsibilities, each knowing exactly what, where and when to contribute in making a perfect dish for the restaurant-goers, with someone managing it, who is however not directly being involved in any of the process details.\n\nI am really impressed with the DIs and IoCs of Laravel, Angular and NestJS. It has really made both the backend and frontend code much more manageable, reusable and testable with time. The key concepts are the same in all the frameworks and are rightly so.

        "text": "I Is an Other: The Secret Life of Metaphor and How It Shapes the Way We See the World\n\nWhat do Aristotle, Elvis Presley, and Shakespeare have in common\n\nImage by M Blackman\n\nIf you think of metaphor as merely a device used in literature, think again. James Geary delves into the realms of behavioural economics, psychology, and neuroscience to present a fascinating insight into metaphor\u2019s role in our world. His book, I Is an Other, explores the role of metaphor in human language, creative thinking, and more. You will never look at a metaphor the same after reading this. You might start spying metaphors everywhere. Oh look, there\u2019s one in the previous sentence!\n\nI Is an Other is arranged in thirteen easily digestible chapters, each given a straightforward descriptive title with an intriguing subtitle (\u2018All Shook Up\u2019\u2019 accompanies the chapter \u2018Metaphor and Thought\u2019). The writing is authoritative but humorous and grounded in the real world. I am a former English teacher and so I loved it, but this book has a broad appeal.\n\nGeary explains metaphorical thinking with the help of Aristotle, Elvis Presley, Rimbaud, and Shakespeare. Metaphors can be defined mathematically as X = Y, in the Aristotelian tradition of \u201cgiving the thing a name that belongs to something else\u201d. This is evidenced in Elvis Presley\u2019s song \u2018All Shook Up\u2019 when he describes his lover\u2019s lips as a volcano (what a poet!), Rimbaud\u2019s metaphor manifesto of I = other, and of course, Romeo\u2019s famous line \u201cJuliet is the sun\u201d. Naturally, philosophers, songwriters, and playwrights will utilise metaphors to create comparisons with rich imagery, but this metaphorical thinking is also what enables creativity in the sciences. Scientists and inventors need to compare what they know about a subject with what they don\u2019t know. For creative thinking to occur, we need to be able to see beyond the literal and metaphorical thinking allows that.\n\nThe world of finance and economics, which you might think of as being purely about numbers and statistics, is full of metaphorical description. Think of stocks soaring, surging, climbing, or, plummeting, sliding, plunging. Wall Street may be gripped by a bear market or a bull market. Geary cites psychologist Michael W. Morris\u2019s research into financial commentary and identifies two primary market metaphors, agent and object metaphors. Agent metaphors describe price movements \u201cas the deliberate action of a living thing\u201d, whereas object metaphors describe price movements as \u201cnon-living things subject to external forces\u201d. The way that we use agent and object metaphors to describe mostly random events feed into the human brain\u2019s expectancy bias. We are programmed to recognise patterns where they might be none whatsoever. If stocks have gone up for six days in a row (as described by the agent metaphor of climbing), we expect them to continue to climb on day seven. Metaphors can be dangerous if unexamined \u2014 beware of your expectancy bias when looking at stock charts!\n\nIf you have ever been to a toddler\u2019s tea party, you will know that young children\u2019s pretend play is full of wonderful metaphors. Between the ages of 12\u201324 months, children develop the ability to pretend, which researchers call \u201cdouble knowledge\u201d. From the age of two years, children start to play make-believe games. When a child hands you a banana so that you can answer a phone call, there are now two bananas; the real one (held to your ear) and the copy (transformed in the imagination so that you can talk as if you are using a real phone). Young children are adept at this as their brains\u2019 pattern recognition circuits are rapidly building and developing, although their understandings are mostly based on simple perceptual similarities. As they grow older, they have difficulty with more sophisticated metaphorical language, until they acquire enough experience to make sense of their world.\n\nPeople with Aspergers Syndrome or other Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have difficulty with metaphorical thinking and Geary provides sound research into the ways ASD affects socialisation and communication. Although he writes sensitively about his subjects in \u2018Metaphor and the Mind: Imagining an Apple in Someone\u2019s Eye\u2019, I wish he could have asked an actual person with ASD about these social difficulties, instead of referencing \u2018The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime\u2019 by Mark Haddon (2004: Vintage). Haddon is a neurotypical author writing about a child with Aspergers, in ways that are often very ableist; Christopher, the main character, is treated terribly by his parents and others around him which is normalised as he has a disability. However, this is balanced by the inclusion of anecdotes from other people with Aspergers who discuss the challenges they face, but also their strengths.\n\nThere are so many topics touched on in this book and the research and examples are all highly interesting. Metaphorical thinking pervades every aspect of our lives, without us even realising it. When reading a work of literature we are attuned to the use of figurative language but our brains are also tuned into the metaphors that surround us in everyday life, satisfying our brain\u2019s need to create patterns. As Geary states, \u201cthe logic of metaphor is the logic of our lives\u201d.\n\nAs a former English teacher and an evergreen lover of literature, I expected to enjoy reading this book. I certainly did but I also found it intellectually stimulating, prompting me to examine some of the biases and assumptions I have about the world. In the words of the great Elvis Presley, I\u2019m all shook up.",

        "title": "How to Be Edited Without Losing Your Mind",
        "text": "Dear Dejected x 2,\n\nAs a writer who has spent many years editing other people\u2019s work, I can feel not only your frustration but your editors\u2019. You can\u2019t imagine how furiously most editors struggle to keep up with all the emails, manuscripts, and phone calls coming at them every minute of every day. Not only are they reading and responding to a staggering number of pitches and submissions, they are negotiating rates and contracts, editing the work they\u2019ve accepted for publication, arranging for artwork to accompany each piece, sending essays and articles to fact checkers and copyeditors, and attending meetings with colleagues in other departments, all while sweating to meet their deadlines. Many editors are writers themselves and would rather be working on their own stuff than editing yours. And now, with most of them editing from their kitchen table while their children are bickering in the background, even ordinary transactions are going to be more fraught than usual.\n\nI applaud you, Rejected, for using this time to complete your essays. But maybe you are rushing to submit your work before it\u2019s ready. During such a catastrophic time, you might be tempted to splash your feelings on the page and send out the most visceral version of some experience. And yet, describing an emotion or intimate event is rarely enough to make a piece compelling. Why should your fear of having sex during the pandemic interest anyone besides your boyfriend? What larger question about your fears are you trying to explore? Have you organized your thoughts in a focused, organic way? Is every sentence polished? Have you let an unbiased friend read the manuscript and provide you with honest feedback? Have you researched the publication and made certain this is exactly the type of essay they want \u2014 not only in terms of subject, but also style and tone? Everyone thinks they are the exception to the guidelines. Oh, sure, the editors say they won\u2019t read anything longer than 2,000 words, but once they start my 20,000-word essay, they\u2019ll get hooked and accept it.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to make you feel worse, Rejected, but if you keep getting turned down by the same publication, maybe you should take the hint. Persistence is admirable, unless you are persisting in sending a personal essay about your lifelong struggle against bulimia to a publication that wants formal, well-researched articles on current events (or vice versa). Reread the magazine\u2019s guidelines and write an essay that fulfills them, or submit the essay you\u2019ve already written somewhere else.\n\nAnd no, you shouldn\u2019t give in to the impulse to ask an editor to explain why they didn\u2019t accept your work. If editors were to respond to every submission they reject, they wouldn\u2019t have time to edit the essays they accept. Besides, asking someone why they won\u2019t publish you is like asking someone why they don\u2019t want to date you. Do you really want to hear them spell out that they like you well enough as a friend but don\u2019t feel the spark necessary to take the relationship to a higher level?\n\nGiven how many thousands of submissions most editors read in a month, the truth might be that your essay, as moving, original, and lyrical as it is, isn\u2019t as moving, original, and lyrical as the two or three submissions the editors found room to print. Unless an editor is knocked out by your essay\u2019s potential, they won\u2019t offer advice on how you might revise it. Otherwise, you could spend weeks reworking the piece, only to have the editor turn it down a second time, and how furious would you be then?\n\nIf an editor rejects an essay but encourages you to send more work, you should be ecstatic. That means the editor considers you a professional and really wants to read what you send them next. I\u2019ve heard editors complain that female writers and writers of color tend to be so discouraged by a rejection, they rarely submit new work, while white male writers immediately send another dozen essays. But no editor would risk getting buried in an avalanche of submissions from a writer they don\u2019t respect, so take such invitations seriously and send that editor your best new work.\n\nWhich brings me to you, Not Rejected. All of us feel angry, insulted, frustrated, depressed, and sick to our stomachs when a draft we thought was ready for publication (if not deserving of a Pulitzer Prize) comes back covered with a thorny vine of comments. How dare you! we think. If you hate my essay so much, why did you accept it? You\u2019re a sadistic egomaniac who\u2019s trying to show who\u2019s boss!\n\nAnd yet, my experience as both an editor and a writer is that at least 85% of the time, the editor is right in pointing out the weakness in a manuscript, even if their suggestion for how to fix that weakness isn\u2019t as effective as the solution you might come up with. When I was younger, I would get so upset by an editor\u2019s response that I would dash off a heated argument or jump right in and start revising. But even in less stressful times than these, you should allow your emotions to cool before reacting. Nearly every submission that\u2019s accepted for publication, whether by the New Yorker or an online zine with a hundred viewers, requires a lot of editing. An editor friend of mine expressed his dismay at writers who think his heavy mark-ups are meant to demonstrate contempt. \u201cWe\u2019re editing hard because we believe in the piece,\u201d he said, \u201cnot because we\u2019re trying to punish you!\u201d\n\nEditors may spend hours, even weeks, editing a submission, only to have the writer get so angry, intimidated, or scared they refuse to work on it further. Not only does the editor lose the time they\u2019ve invested \u2014 and a piece they truly wanted to see in their magazine \u2014 the writer loses the chance to see that essay in print.\n\nInstead of jumping in with a quick response, allow an editor\u2019s comments to filter through your consciousness. Some suggestions will resonate with what you suspected. Didn\u2019t you already know you should cut that digressive paragraph, smooth out those awkward sentences, fill in that missing context, or include a scene or two to relieve all that exposition? Be grateful to your editor for forcing you to admit what you knew was true and meet \u2014 or exceed \u2014 your own high standards.\n\nOther suggestions will strike you as too daunting to carry out. How could you possibly find the wherewithal to take your essay apart and restructure it? Or carry out even more research than you\u2019ve already done? Or rethink your argument? And yet, as you rant and sob, you already can sense that following your editor\u2019s suggestion will improve your work. You might even find your heart racing as you imagine how much better your essay will be once you revise it.\n\nEven if you accept what your editor suggests as warranted, you might be unsure how to accomplish a particular revision. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask the editor for more direction. This is what editors do: They help their writers revise their work. As long as you don\u2019t send five emails in a row or require too much hand holding, your editor will help you as best they can.\n\nEven if an editor\u2019s advice seems wrongheaded, arguing does little good. Suppose the editor points out an aspect of your essay that seems unclear. You moron! you want to scream. Can\u2019t you read? The explanation is right there on the page! Remember: You are much closer to the material than your editor. They might have read too quickly to catch the brief mention in paragraph five that your soccer coach was your mother\u2019s brother. But most people will be reading even more quickly than that editor. And maybe you are so adept at fixing a transmission you don\u2019t realize most readers won\u2019t even know what a transmission is.\n\nAs an outsider, your editor can provide invaluable perspective, alerting you that an argument isn\u2019t logical or you\u2019ve omitted a detail that is crucial to our understanding of your narrative. You can argue all you want, but that won\u2019t make your editor not see the flaw. Of course, their suggestion as to how to revise your essay might be misguided. But if you can come up with a more elegant way to fix the weakness, your editor will probably thank you.\n\nThe same is true for passages your editor rewrites using their voice instead of yours. If you acknowledge the original sentence was awkward or confusing, then you can tactfully point out the new version doesn\u2019t quite mesh with the tone or style of the rest of the essay and then tweak the editor\u2019s version so it sounds like you.\n\nThat said, try not to get too precious about your prose. An editor might alter or destroy the cadence of a sentence by cutting a word or phrase. But the benefit of eliminating all that wordiness and repetition usually outweighs the loss of a rhythm only you can hear. In some cases, the editor is required to make your usage conform to the publication\u2019s style guide. Unless you are a poet, such tiny changes usually aren\u2019t worth the argument.\n\nThe advantage of not fighting with your editor over the difference between a semicolon and a comma is you can save your firepower for the one or two suggestions that run counter to your instincts. Even then, your instincts might be too fuzzy to hold up in court. If your editor pushes you to take your piece in directions that run counter to your intentions, that might be because you haven\u2019t made those intentions clear. Before you begin drafting a defensive email, make sure you can articulate the essay\u2019s central question and line of thought your reader is meant to follow. Is that line of argumentation right there on the page? If not, thank your editor for pointing out the lack of focus or clarity and promise to revise accordingly.\n\nIf your editor does push you to make change you can\u2019t abide, then politely, gently, hold your ground. Let\u2019s say your editor wants you to cut a scene that is emotionally moving, beautifully expressed, and essential to the essay\u2019s meaning. Even then, you might want to ask a friend to verify that the editor\u2019s suggestion is misguided. If you remain certain you are right, wait to bring up this disagreement until you have fulfilled all of the editor\u2019s more reasonable requests. Express your gratitude for the suggestions that improved the essay. Then, point out how and why you disagree with the advice to cut that scene. Offer to add a sentence or two to clarify its importance. If the changes your editor has suggested might come across as racially insensitive, sexist, or cliched, tactfully point this out.\n\nIf you treat your editor with respect, they most likely will back down from their suggestion. I have even known an editor or two to admit that they were wrong.",

        "text": "Five years is a long time to live stuck in your head and cut off from the world without the ability to let anyone in, or reach out to anyone.\n\nIf this sounds extreme, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve yet to access therapy and thus support. I have insurance but can\u2019t afford the co-pays because my household survives on one salary already stretched to breaking point.\n\nAs a result, there are many normal things we do without. Health care has been one of them, food often is another. There is a lot of empty space in our house where furniture should be. We exist, we do not live. In five years, we\u2019ve hardly ever had anything resembling a social life either. The so-called Holiday Season is something that has been happening to other people, rarely to us. Our marriage is groaning under the strain and has been on life support for a long time, the antithesis of joy.\n\nEach of us feels let down, abandoned by the other. At least on this we\u2019re on the same page. If I write so much about depression, it\u2019s to try and instill some empathy in those who\u2019ve never experienced it and see it as a choice. Were it a choice, it would be a very perverse one that has condemned me to a pared down existence where shelter and food are never guaranteed, never mind anything else. Why would anyone do this to themselves?\n\nIn this context, writing is a way of flipping the bird at adversity and reclaiming a little agency, a little independence.\n\nMore recently, writing has come to represent something else, too: The ability to see my family again. Unless I make this airfare happen myself, it won\u2019t and I will forever have to live with the fact that I abandoned my father when he needed me the most. Long story short, my stepmom is undergoing treatment for stage 4 breast cancer and my 71-year-old dad is her sole carer.\n\nThis, to me, has made everything else in my life pale into insignificance. I am an only child and last saw my father in 2013, my mother in 2014. My family has never met my husband although we\u2019ve been married for over five years. Writing this, it occurs to me how horrible it is.\n\nWriting, you see, is a way to articulate all that has been festering within and keeping me sick.\n\nSince my best friend died at the end of September, the page has become my only interlocutor. There are few conversations in my household. Our life isn\u2019t conducive to trusting, open-hearted talk anymore. Instead, our exchanges are stilted, wooden, guarded. I quickly learned that anything I say could backfire. In our respective silences, you can hear the low hum of distrust and the hiss of resentment, ready to pounce whenever vulnerability arises.\n\nI made the mistake of pretending I was strong, right at the beginning. I also made the mistake of relinquishing my assertiveness. I\u2019ve paid for those mistakes with my writing voice and my mental health.",

        "text": "Hedonic Well-Being\n\nThe hedonic aspect of well-being has to do with positive affect and mood states. It\u2019s about maximizing pleasure and enjoyment at the same time as minimizing pain and suffering.\n\nDaniel Kahneman and other psychologists argue that this is one of the most important aspects of well-being. They argue that research and clinical treatments should focus on hedonism; they should amplify happiness, foster pleasurable experiences, and reduce negative emotions like sadness and dissatisfaction.\n\nDigital games quite clearly contribute to these positive mood states \u2014 they\u2019re fun. The interactive and rewarding features in games have been shown to result in pleasurable experiences.\n\nSome studies have found that games help to reduce negative states like stress and sadness. They have been found to help people recover from workplace exhaustion and work-related stress \u2014 much more so than watching videos or TV.\n\nThey seem to do this by creating \u201ceffectance\u201d: the positive feelings that come from seeing that actions have an impact or make a difference. Gamers get a sense of gratification from the ability to influence the fantasy world. They become more than just passive viewers; they become active players. This can create feelings of satisfaction and flow that contribute to satisfaction and well-being.\n\nEudaimonic Well-Being\n\nEudaimonia was originally proposed by Aristotle. He suggested that the \u201cgood life\u201d was about more than just maximizing pleasure and happiness and minimizing suffering. He suggested that it\u2019s also about personal grown, reason, and virtue. Eudaimonia is conceptualized as having several components, including mastery of challenges, personal growth, good relationships with others, and having a purpose in life.\n\nMore recently, Deci and Ryan have proposed the Self-Determination Theory. It parallels Aristotle\u2019s Eudaimonia in many ways. It suggests that there are three basic psychological needs that humans try to satisfy: autonomy, or being able to guide one\u2019s own decisions; competence, which is the need to be good at things and achieve mastery of skills; and relatedness, which is the need to connect with others.\n\nSeveral studies have found that those who feel autonomous, competent, and connected to others are also much more likely to have higher well-being ratings.\n\nDigital games are satisfying in part because they create a situation where gamers get to practice autonomy, master skills, and connect with others. They provide opportunities for gamers to make choices about what happens to them, contributing to feelings of autonomy. They provide challenges that players can overcome, contributing to a sense of mastery. And the multiplayer features of many games, including popular online games, allow gamers to satisfy their need to be connected to others.\n\nSocial Well-being\n\nSocial connectedness is perhaps one of the most important aspects of well-being. Many studies have found that the quality of our relationships is one of the biggest predictors of happiness. Basically, the better you feel about your relationships, the better you feel.\n\nGaming can be a social sport, but it\u2019s usually not. More than half of frequent gamers play multiplayer games at least once a week and say that gaming is a good way to keep in touch with friends.\n\nThat could be why the research suggests that gaming can be a good way for people to develop their social relationships. Some studies have found that gaming is an effective way for people to start relationships with others and for those relationships to become deep and meaningful. It also does not seem to displace the time spent with in-person friends. Gaming also seems to lead to lower levels of loneliness. In all of these ways, gaming seems to be a potent contributor to social well-being.\n\nSo what\u2019s the take-away?\n\nGaming isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThere can indeed be some negative effects, and some people can get to the point where their behaviour looks like an addiction.\n\nBut, for the majority of individuals engaging in digital games, there may also be some significant positive side-effects. The research presented here suggests that video games can actually give a powerful boost to psychological well-being.",

        "text": "Downgrading Tech, Upgrading Humanity\n\nThree simple steps to be less addicted to your phone\n\nWe spend an increasing amount of time online, on social media/entertainment or even checking notifications on our devices to our own detriment \u2014 whether it\u2019s doomscrolling or getting stuck in a YouTube or Wikipedia spiral.\n\nAs many things in life have shifted to screens due to day to day life this past year, it\u2019s even easier to be complacent and waste time on your phone (or device of choice) for no particular reason. Given that being online might be the only avenue for connections, work, education, learning, hobbies, no wonder we\u2019re spending more time in front of a screen \u2014 there just isn\u2019t a good alternative for the time being. However, there\u2019s still nuance between thoughtful vs. passive consumption.\n\nMost of us already know that time is valuable.\n\nSpending time wisely is about making the most of your time to pursue what\u2019s valuable and beneficial among competing distractions.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re tired of being bombarded with political news, feeling chained to your inbox or bouncing between notifications on different apps, here\u2019s a few simple steps that I tried and found to work (for me) to be less addicted to my phone.\n\nStep 1: Put your phone somewhere you can\u2019t easily see or reach\n\nThere\u2019s a story in Greek mythology about the warrior Ulysses and the Sirens. While journeying home after war, he had to face many trials, one of which was a guide a ship past an island with these dangerous, enchanting creatures who lured sailors overboard to their deaths with song.\n\nHeeding advice from a goddess, Ulysses instructed his sailors tie him to a ship and stuff their own ears with wax which allowed them to pass through. Though he was lured by the Sirens\u2019 voices, he wasn\u2019t able to physically move and therefore, was safe.\n\nThe idea is that if we know what will be distracting and understand our own weaknesses, we can prepare ahead of time and \u201cself-bind\u201d in order to remove likely distractions, such as by placing your phone away from your nightstand or out of sight during work hours.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be drawn to checking your device, just that you start with an environment that reinforces the habits you want to build. This can even extend to other goals, like putting exercise clothes in a visible place to make daily exercise a routine.\n\nTip: Don\u2019t rely on willpower, change your environment.\n\nStep 2: Turn off notifications and sounds\n\nNotifications (coupled with sounds) are triggers to check for updates. Typically they are shown as a red dot with a count. Red has the significance of urgency and importance, yet after being used everywhere, it can be a stressful feeling to be being constantly interrupted from a state of flow.\n\nWe must strive to balance what\u2019s urgent vs. what\u2019s important. Notifications can obscure this critical distinction.\n\nTip: Reduce noisy interruptions by turning off all notifications and opting in to the few you actually need.\n\nStep 3: Greyscale mode\n\nColors traditionally draw attention and affect our emotions \u2014 by using grayscale I reduce the amount of stimuli I get through color. My phone and any social media app are also much less enticing without colors.\n\nHere\u2019s how to turn greyscale mode on (iPhone, Android)\n\nWhile I can\u2019t do this for all my devices (as a designer, this is impractical), this has helped make long period of screen time on my phone less interesting = leading to less time spent staring glazed-eyed scrolling memes.\n\nTip: Intentionally remove color/delete apps to make your phone less engaging.\n\nConclusion\n\nLast step here is a periodic check-in for alignment between values and action. Reflect on how you spend time in a day/week/month vs. what you say is important. Do these line up?\n\nIt\u2019s a little grim to be constantly thinking about how much time you have left. But to be intentional about how you live with the time you\u2019re given makes for a mindful life.",

        "text": "Finding The Right Question Not Answer\n\nWhen faced with a problem, one of the first reflexes of your mind might be to find a way to solve it.\n\nYou want to find the perfect element that might fit your situation.\n\nResearch has shown that this problem-solving attitude can stick you to a single framework of problematization while seeking solutions.\n\nInstead of helping you find the best solution, this attitude can reduce you to a single perspective detrimental to your creativity.\n\nThe psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and his team at the University of Chicago have led experiments highlighting a more creative attitude.\n\nObserving art students arranging diverse objects on a table into a composition, they noticed two groups of artists who had different approaches to the exercise.\n\nThe first group would quickly select the objects within their reach and immediately begin working on their composition.\n\nThe second group would take some time to examine the objects, picking them up, turning them down, even changing their arrangement while working on their composition.\n\nThe result was that the latter group produced works that were judged much more favorably by judges than those in the first group.\n\nWhat made the second type of student more creative was their ability to keep their compositional arrangements open, actively seeking questions to ask instead of finding immediate answers.\n\nMeanwhile, the first type of students, by focusing on one framework, prevented themselves from experimenting with other perspectives and finding unexpected solutions.\n\nLike the most talented students, you may avoid getting stuck in one way of asking a question for your problem: always try to find other questions that might be more relevant to your situation.",

        "title": "3 Keys To Dominate Your Growing To-Do List",
        "text": "If you\u2019re like me, you have a growing to-do list filled with big ideas to accomplish. Yet it might often seem like the day quickly gets away from you. Meetings, emails, social media, and other distractions suck up your time, along with your precious attention.\n\nWinning the day begins before you even sit down at your desk. Thoughtful planning and prioritization is the best way to play defense against the many tasks vying for your focus. Building in the opportunity for reflection, while difficult, is an instant productivity booster, allowing you to get more done in less time with greater impact.\n\nOn a recent episode of the Accidental Creative podcast, author Todd Henry shared a simple 10-minute method you can use to optimize your schedule and create mental bandwidth for deep, creative work.\n\nHe suggests sitting down at the beginning of the day to strategize, specifically following these steps:\n\nAsk yourself: At the end of the day, what would have to happen for me to say, \u201cToday was a success?\u201d\n\nHenry says, \u201cTime is the currency of productivity, especially for creative professionals,\u201d so make sure (to the extent possible) that your day effectively leverages your strengths, fulfills your values, satisfies important goals, and is filled with tasks or people that energize you.\n\nDefine the problems you need to solve today.\n\nAnswering this question allows you to work backward and create a plan of attack, ensuring that you spend your time wisely in high-impact ways. Henry points out this question will not only help you become more focused, but will also prime you to seek creative solutions for the problems you need to solve.\n\nBlock time for deep work.\n\nIf you don\u2019t guard your time, distractions and busywork will rush in to fill the vacuum. Henry suggests creative professionals pre-commit chunks of time throughout their week to accomplish deep work \u2014 that is, cognitively demanding work that requires concentration and uninterrupted focus.\n\nThen respect the appointments you set with yourself. Yes, that does mean you\u2019ll have to get better at assertively saying \u201cno\u201d and communicating your boundaries, but overcoming that discomfort can pay off in big ways.\n\nLiked this article?

        "text": "A few years back I had a client.\n\nThis client had a beautiful web site. That beautiful web site had been designed by a renowned design agency. And on that beautiful web site the client published articles that were well-reported and infographics that were quite attractive.\n\nFrom the outside, everything looked professional. Healthy. Successful.\n\nBut the client had a problem. Traffic wasn\u2019t growing.\n\nWhat can we do to improve, they asked.\n\nI asked about the amount of content.\n\nNo, they said, we can\u2019t change that. Our budget is maxed out.\n\nI asked about the quality of the content.\n\nNo they said, we can\u2019t change that. We like our articles, they\u2019re thorough.\n\nI asked about where they distribute their content.\n\nNo they said, we can\u2019t change that. We don\u2019t have the staff.\n\nThen they thought for a minute and then asked: What if, instead of making any of those changes, we just redesign the site?\n\nWhy would you do that, I said. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s least wrong.\n\nBecause, they said, and I will never forget this: that\u2019s the thing we know we can control.\n\nThe search for certainty instead of explanations\n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about that client. They had a lot of challenges. They were aware of those challenges. They wanted to improve. That\u2019s more than most.\n\nBut they were searching for certainty, rather than for an explanation.\n\nThey should have been asking: what does our audience want? Why do they want it? How can we give it to them? They should have been looking for explanations of their marketplace.\n\nInstead, they were asking: what do we want? How can we make what we want with as little pain as possible? They were looking for certainty of themselves.\n\nThe result: They had created a perfectly consistent asset creation machine that very few people outside that machine cared about. A bright and pretty dead thing.\n\nIn other words, they spent very little time creating.\n\nInstead, they spent all their time trying to stay in control.\n\nThe search for consistency instead of coherence\n\nWho hasn\u2019t spent their time trying to be in control? After all, the scariest thing in the world is to create.\n\nCreativity is an exploration of an unknown. It\u2019s trying something, seeing whether it works, then iterating on the effort until the result improves. It\u2019s testing your way to viability.\n\nIf this sounds like an organism scratching around in the dark to find the best source of light and food, well there you go. Organisms are great explorers. Organisms have very good product-market fit.\n\nCreating content for brands? Same same.\n\nTo be successful, the brand must be consistent. Not consistent in results, though that will come. Rather, consistent in efforts. Consistency of effort creates coherence of results.\n\nIf you think that\u2019s not true, consider any successful brand. Apple is a successful hardware company because they created a consistent process of building the iPhone. Each new iPhone release is different, yet the product iterations are coherent. They have \u201ciPhone-ness\u201d.\n\nFord is a successful automobile manufacturer because they created a consistent process for creating the F-150. Each new model is different, yet the product iterations are coherent. Ah yes, the buyers says: this quacks like the duck I know.\n\nWIRED is a successful magazine because they created a successful process for making WIRED magazine. Each new issue is different, yet the iterations in features and interviews and photographs are coherent. Good read, every time.\n\nAnd so this is what I tell clients today.\n\nFocus first on efforts, rather than results.\n\nFocus on building an engine of creativity, rather than a facade of assets.\n\nFocus on the relationship with your audience, rather than yourself.\n\nAsk what they want.\n\nAsk how you can give it to them.\n\nFigure out how giving it to them fits with your brand priorities.\n\nYou shall surely be successful.",

        "title": "Seeing Sounds: What It\u2019s Like to Live With Synesthesia",
        "text": "Elemental: What is happening when someone experiences synesthesia?\n\nDr. Richard Cytowic: It\u2019s an issue of cross talk. All brains have cross talk among not only the senses, but among the different aspects of cognition and thinking. It\u2019s just that synesthetes have more of this cross talk, and they\u2019re consciously aware that they have it; therefore, they experience this overt synesthesia.\n\nI read that everyone has synesthesia to a degree. It\u2019s just that some are not aware that they have it, right?\n\nWe\u2019re largely unaware of the cross couplings that are going on in our brain all the time. For example, when we\u2019re at the movies, we believe that the sound is coming from the actor\u2019s mouth on the screen, not the speakers that are surrounding us. These kinds of things are so common that we don\u2019t even think that they\u2019re unusual in any way. It\u2019s only when people say, \u201cOh, I see music,\u201d that some think that\u2019s rather peculiar. If you think about it, it has to be that way because otherwise we\u2019d never be as intelligent and creative as we are today.\n\nSo this is part of human evolution?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I would frame it in terms of evolution. It\u2019s just that [synesthetes are] aware they have a different texture of reality because they\u2019re more aware of what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s obviously a very delightful trait to have. Synesthetes have measurably superior memories than the rest of us because, again, they have all these different sensations that help them hook things onto. Their ability to index their spatial memory is extremely good. They can see things in their mind\u2019s eye.\n\nI remember talking to my mom about [the way my memory is organized] and asking her, \u201cWhen you see the calendar, do you see January through June in one column, and then July through December in the other column?\u201d And she just said, \u201cYeah. Doesn\u2019t everybody?\u201d It\u2019s funny.\n\nSo she has a similar [type of synesthesia]. And how does it help you?\n\nIt definitely helps with my memory. It helps at work. When I\u2019m trying to recall where I saw something on a page, for example, I can usually in my mind\u2019s eye visualize, \u201cOh, it\u2019s on my top left page, right over here.\u201d And also just in general, I am very organized and everything has to have its place.\n\nThis [spatially-oriented memory] is very typical.\n\nSo my mother has it as well \u2014 is it genetic?\n\nOne in 23 people inherit the genes for synesthesia. A smaller number\u2014or one in 90 people worldwide\u2014has some kind of overt synesthesia. The most common are [seeing] colored days of the week, colored letters and numerals, colored hearings, etc. So, that\u2019s 4% of the population, which is really quite high. Why does evolution maintain this gene for a pretty, but obviously useless, trait? The answer, I think, is that it\u2019s really a gene for metaphor. As a species, it makes us much more creative, and we\u2019re able to see connections that are not necessarily logical or rational.\n\nThat must have to do with the fact that we hear of more cases among artists or creatives?\n\nThere are more synesthetes who happen to be famous artists than there are famous artists who happen to be synesthetic. So yeah, we know it because of the people who talk about it.\n\nBefore this, I googled synesthesia and one of the things that auto-populated in the search bar was, \u201cIs synesthesia a mental illness?\u201d Even though it might have gained more exposure today than when you started researching, people still don\u2019t really understand.\n\nThere\u2019s this unwillingness to accept that other people have a different point of view. And then from a biological point of view, a small change in one\u2019s DNA completely alters how you perceive the world. But some say, \u201cOh, this is crazy because I don\u2019t understand that. Therefore, it must be wrong.\u201d\n\nAre there any correlations that you\u2019ve found between synesthesia and cognitive function?\n\nPeople with synesthesia have elevated memory; they have elevated spatial sense. Then there are also some real deficits. They have difficulty with arithmetic and with direction findings, so they get lost. Especially in cities that are set up on a grid.\n\nAnd why is that?\n\nIf you have an elevation in one [brain hemisphere], you\u2019re likely to find a diminution somewhere else. It\u2019s a use it or lose it [kind of thing]. And so if you have it, you may have difficulties. Right/left confusion is very common. Direction with signs, difficulty with mathematics\u2014all of that.\n\nYou\u2019re describing my life to a T. It\u2019s like how a blind person may have a heightened sense of smell or hearing because they can\u2019t see, right?\n\nIt is very common among blind people. Their visuality or unused visual cortex is available\u2014both for other things. And so other brain maps encroach onto the now unused visual cortex.\n\nI know there are different kinds and combinations of synesthesia. How many combinations are there?\n\nAbout 165 different kinds, but some are much more common than others. And the main thing is that synesthesia is often a one-way street. So, if sound goes to vision, vision normally doesn\u2019t go to sound. There\u2019s a small minority of people who are bidirectional, and it is confusing to them.\n\nWhat would that look like?\n\nThere\u2019s a music teacher outside of London whose synesthesia does go in both directions. She lives a relatively restricted life in the country because otherwise whenever she\u2019s seeing electric signs, [they] create this blaring sound that\u2019s disruptive and confusing. She participated in a BBC documentary [in the 1990s] and agreed to go into Piccadilly Circus at night, with all those neon signs. She described [the sensations] saying, \u2018This is a horrible sound and it\u2019s screaming at me.\u2019 And then after about 30 or 40 seconds, she says, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get out of here. I\u2019m going to pass out.\u2019\n\nWow. There are so many more different combinations than I realized.\n\nAgain, some are much more common than others. With color and movement and shape, I often say it\u2019s like fireworks as long as the sound is going. So some shape and color appears, it scintillates, moves around a little bit. It fades and gets replaced by something else as long as the stimulating sound continues.\n\n[Overall], I think if there\u2019s [one] lesson in synesthesia, it would be that listening is not a passive experience of hearing sounds. Listening is an active process. Everybody has a point of view different from yours.",

        "text": "Create Your Playbook: A Solution for All Life Has to Throw at You\n\nThe one, priceless book you must write over your lifetime\n\nCreate your own custom playbook for life\u2019s solutions\n\nEver wish you had a book you could pull off the shelf and it would give you the answer to any motivational problem? I\u2019ve got the solution here. Ever have a bad day when you can\u2019t get started, when the world seems to conspire against you? Here\u2019s the answer.\n\nThis is your playbook.\n\nI got the idea loosely from the famous motivational guru, Jim Rohn, through a fantastic, self-help guy named Alexander Heyne. The basic idea is that whenever you encounter a struggle in life, you perform a deep analysis in a journal.\n\nThis project is bigger than me, but I hope to do it justice enough you find value in it. The playbook concept may be the best self-help book ever created \u2014 and you\u2019re going to write it!\n\nWe\u2019ll get to the how-to parts of crafting your playbook in a minute, but first I want to delve into why it\u2019s important to make your own. We all need a playbook. My playbook is different than yours is different than hers.\n\nEvery coach has a playbook.\n\nWe don\u2019t run into battle without a plan, or go off on a journey without a map. For some reason we repeat the same emotional battles without giving ourselves the tools to get through them.\n\nEmotions effect our work. When we can\u2019t pull through the darker emotional states, most of us avoid the work altogether. We hide in our caves. We take the easy way out. We escape, using things that harm us.\n\nI need a playbook. You need a playbook. We all need a playbook.\n\nThe basic premise of the playbook is you dedicate a specific journal for the process. This is a collection of emotional states and project hurdles. You\u2019ll ad to this collection over the course of your life. Every time you run into a wall, instead of avoiding the problem or ignoring it, you perform a deep analysis on a page or two. As time progresses, you\u2019ll refer to the playbook for answers rather then add to it.\n\nEventually, you\u2019ll repeat these problems. Now you\u2019ll be ready.\n\nWe all have a core set of behaviors that make us who we are. We tend to repeat these behaviors every time we run into a similar problem. I know I didn\u2019t realize how repetitive my behavior was. You may not either. When you analyze each problem in a playbook, you\u2019ll see the pattern. You can say when I feel this way if I do this, I can make it better.\n\nOr, if I run into this problem with my business, last year I had the same problem. This is what worked.\n\nThis story is just to get you started. This is a lifetime process of addition and analysis. Your playbook is yours alone. Although it may help others, this is a bespoke solution for your life. You will collect, take-apart, and solve some of the most-difficult problems in your life. We\u2019ll take them apart in tiny pieces. Eventually, you\u2019ll have priceless answers.\n\nLet\u2019s get started, eh?",

We at Random Awesome are honored to name her our Featured Author for November 2020, and she kindly agreed to answer a few questions.\n\nFamily, Dogs, and Gardens \u2014 Oh my!\n\nRA: Tell us a little about yourself.\n\nMy name is Aim\u00e9e Gramblin \u2014 I\u2019m a 42-year-old Oklahoman who lives in Tulsa with my husband of 18 (!) years, 2 children, Jaden (12), and Ceci (short for Cecilia, 10), and our two dogs, Juno and Nugget.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not writing, I\u2019m wandering our backyard, searching for all things nature and gardening. My greatest moments of understanding and reflection usually occur in the garden. Gardening and nature allowed me to write my memoir, which was a huge exercise in healing.\n\nPhoto of the Gramblin family \u2014 provided by Aim\u00e9e Gramblin\n\nIn December 2019/January 2020, I experienced a debilitating bout of depression and finally realized that along with my known mental health issues, I\u2019d been dealing with chronic pain most of my life. I wrote about that here.\n\nAfter working outside as a gardener at our local botanic garden for almost 3 years, I resigned from my job and have been finding my way back to writing professionally since I\u2019ve been healed enough to do so.\n\nRed Fred and Round-Robin\n\nRA: When did you start writing?\n\nI think I started writing in my head when my dad played records, made up stories for me called \u201cRed Fred,\u201d and my mom and dad both read to me. My mom and I recorded round-robin stories on a tape player before I could write, I think; thus a storyteller was born.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely in my genes. In 2nd grade, we kept a writing journal, and Mrs. Nichols responded enthusiastically to each entry. I\u2019ve been writing in some way or another ever since. My college degrees are in English-Creative Studies with poetry emphasis (a BA and MA).\n\nBless Me and Run with Wolves\n\nRA: What authors and books inspire you?\n\nRudolfo Anaya, who wrote Bless Me, Ultima, has had a deep influence on me, and I think you can see that in my Aleks and Gaby series, which is published every Friday in PS I Love you for Fiction Friday.\n\nI recently \u2014 finally \u2014 listened to Women Who Run With The Wolves by Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s, which really resonated with me. This year has been my Wild Woman year for sure. I find myself drawn to a lot of Latin American literature \u2014 the mix of magical realism, emotion, and intuition speaks to me. One more book I\u2019ll mention is In The Time of the Butterflies by Julia Alvarez.\n\nHooked on Medium\n\nRA: What inspired you to join Medium?\n\nI thought blogging was kind of a past-tense boat that I\u2019d missed out on. Then, in March 2020, my mom (INFJ Elder on Medium) told me she\u2019d started a WordPress blog and felt very frustrated in learning how to build it. I offered to do a little research and try to find something easier. I found Medium, signed up, started writing, and got hooked pretty quickly! :D\n\nRA: What\u2019s your favorite thing about publishing on Medium?\n\nIt\u2019s so quick! The chances of my stories being seen are fairly high \u2014 and then I get to talk about them. I\u2019m no longer writing into a void. Beautiful friendships have bloomed through Medium. The networking has been amazing! Ok \u2014 that\u2019s more than one thing, lol.\n\nphoto provided by Aim\u00e9e Gramblin\n\nShout-Outs!\n\nRA: Want to shout out to some authors? Now\u2019s your chance!\n\nYes! First of all, you, Toni Tails! I\u2019m inspired by your amazing ability to navigate deep, painful life experiences and also bring a quirky, fun, vivid presence to the platform. I\u2019d also like to shout-out my co-editors and good friends at Age of Empathy, Shanna Loga and Melissa Bee.\n\nShanna writes in-depth think pieces and has recently broken into poetry as well. Melissa writes inspiration, poetry, fiction, and more. They are both incredibly talented writers and wonderful people.\n\nSusan Brearley, MuddyUm owner; Jay Squires, Genius in a Bottle founder; and Victor Sarkin, current Genius in a Bottle owner \u2014 have all been wonderful mentors.\n\nShout-Out to Dad!\n\nI\u2019d also like to give my dad, Dr. Steven E.

        "title": "The Creativity Secrets of Jeff Tweedy",
        "text": "Jeff Tweedy's memoir, Let's Go (So We Can Get Back) includes expected anecdotes about his growing up, his struggles with addiction and the evolving nature of his band, Wilco. It's also about his creative process, which I found most fascinating.\n\nI've pulled a few of the creativity lessons from the book. Please keep in mind these nuggets are not as valuable as they are within the context of the book, but it's still valuable (to me, anyway) to have a concise list.\n\nBe Vulnerable\n\nIt's a strength. His \"superpower.\u201d He has a \"bone crushing earnestness, a weaponized sincerity.\u201d\n\nTweedy says he is\n\n\"impervious to peer's shame. They couldn't make me recoil with their snickering or judgmental sneers.\"\n\nThe sneers and snickering are powerful and prevent most of us from sharing our art, or our idea, or something new. Being able to put those sneers aside and perform, or write, or publish is so valuable.\n\nFailing is Genius\n\nAs a result of Tweedy\u2019s vulnerability, he is comfortable with failing. In fact he encourages it.\n\n\"The people who seem the most like geniuses are not geniuses. They're just more comfortable with failing. They try more and they try harder than other people.\u201d\n\nBeing vulnerable goes hand in hand with your willingness to fail. When you fail often, you learn more, and, eventually, you'll succeed. And then, one day, you\u2019ll be labeled a genius.\n\nHave a Secret Lab\n\nFrom Fretboard Journal\n\nHaving a dedicated lab or workspace is important. Tweedy's is the Loft, a Chicago studio/office/hangout for the band. It's a place designed for playing, jamming and recording. It's their space, intended for the purpose of their creativity. Having that nook, or desk, or office is important. It\u2019s the workshop for innovation. Keeping that space dedicated to one purpose helps keep your mind focused on that purpose. Wilco has new and vintage instruments, bunk beds and a kitchen. For most of us, a quiet desk will suffice. A table at a noisy coffee shop probably will not.\n\nFind the Tools that Work for You\n\nTweedy says:\n\n\u201cI learned pretty early on that I don\u2019t like new strings. They\u2019re so bright and cheery. I hate everything about them. I need strings that are weighted down by history, inhibited by their own filthy past.\u201d\n\nThose overused strings are Tweedy\u2019s constraints that he chooses to work with. He recognizes that this medium works for his voice and his type of songwriting. From these tools, his creativity emerges. For you and me, it\u2019s recognizing where and how you do your best work and working within those constraints. For me, my passion is finding new ways to tell stories about technology, and ensuring these stories are related succinctly, simply and memorably. That\u2019s my domain. That's my constraint. Those are my old strings.\n\nBring in New Voices\n\nFrom Wilco Facebook page\n\nEven though Wilco has been around for nearly 25 years, the roster, other than Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt, has flipped several times. Some of these personnel changes, like with guitarist Jay Bennett, are famous and dramatic. Other departures were very cordial and professional. Tweedy acknowledges that new talent infuses the band with new ideas. Bennett's ideas were critical to the classic album: Being There. Glen Kotche and Nels Cline joined later and brought new talents and opportunities for experimentation. Over time, Tweedy has collaborated with other artists like Billy Bragg, Mavis Staples and even his own sons. These collaborations allow him to explore new aspects of his creativity and pushes him. We should find new partners to do the same in our own endeavors.",

        "title": "Hungry for More \u2014 Eating to Fill the Void Inside",
        "text": "How do you know if you\u2019re comfort eating or just hungry?\n\nSo many of us suffer from food addiction that it might be difficult to understand the difference. There are some signs you can use to know when you may be eating from stress rather than from hunger. If you suspect you may be eating to fill the void inside, you can learn how to tell the difference.\n\nWanting specific foods\n\nIf you have a strong desire for specific food and don\u2019t want anything else, this stems from emotional hunger. When your body is actually in need of food, the desire for what to eat is not as defined. While you might have some desire based on nutrients your body needs, if you find you want one particular food or texture then you want the taste and not the nutrients.\n\nEating without thinking\n\nIf you start to eat something and don\u2019t even think about what you\u2019re consuming or how much, this is another sign you may be emotionally eating. Mindlessly consuming an entire bag of chips is driven by the comfort of habit and not by the need for food.\n\nDesire to eat is sudden\n\nOne of the biggest indicators that your hunger is driven by a void inside instead of a need for sustenance is if you suddenly become hungry. This is similar to how someone addicted to cigarettes will need to smoke immediately after a stressful incident. Something has triggered the feelings you\u2019re trying to avoid. Real hunger comes on slowly and over time. It\u2019s also regular, while emotional hunger comes with circumstances or memories that are brought up.\n\nIt leads to guilt\n\nFood addiction will lead you to feel guilty for eating. It\u2019s tied closely to shame and lowered self-esteem. All addictions involve these feelings, and it creates a spiral that\u2019s hard to climb out of. You eat to escape terrible emotions and thoughts, but that eating creates more of those emotions and thoughts.\n\nIt won\u2019t satisfy\n\nBecause of this, while emotional eating may alleviate these unpleasant experiences for a few moments, it lacks any real satisfaction. You will only end up feeling the same or worse. Because it\u2019s not actually helping to heal that internal void, it won\u2019t stop these emotions from just coming up again and again.\n\nYou feel it in a different way\n\nHunger is physical and you will feel it in your stomach as a pang or grumbling. Emotional hunger is driven by feelings. It will show itself as a craving or desire for certain foods that you can\u2019t get out of your head. You will want tastes or textures instead of simply satisfying a physical need.",

        "title": "How Memory and Learning Can Improve Quality of Life",
        "text": "Nancy D. Chiaravalloti, PhD is Director of the Center for Neuropsychology and Neuroscience Research and the Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Research at Kessler Foundation and Research Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Rutgers University, New Jersey Medical School. Dr. Chiaravalloti conducts research in cognitive rehabilitation, particularly in new learning, memory and processing speed. She has led numerous externally funded randomized clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation protocols in clinical populations, examining post-treatment changes from multiple vantage points such as objective behavior (neuropsychological tests), everyday life (questionnaires, tests of daily life functioning) and at the level of the brain (functional neuroimaging).\n\nIn this interview, Nancy Chiaravalloti discusses her research on memory and learning and its potential impact. She also gives us a glimpse into the future of neuroscience and how technology is enabling new advances in research.\n\nWhat is the focus of your research?\n\nMy research seeks to identify treatments for improving new learning and memory. New learning and memory refers to the acquisition of knowledge or skills by experience, study or being taught [learning; https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/learning] and the means by which this information is stored [memory; https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/memory] for later use. Several neurological illnesses and injuries are associated with deficits in new learning and memory, such as Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury. These deficits have a significant impact on an individual\u2019s everyday life and overall quality of life.\n\nWhy is this work important?\n\nResearch has shown that difficulties with new learning and memory have a significant impact on everyday life and overall quality of life for several reasons. First, our memories are essential to who we are as individuals and as members of the communities in which we engage. For example, a characteristic that a person might use to describe himself could be \u201ceasy to get to know\u201d. The presence of this characteristic however relies on your memory in several respects. You have to remember your previous experiences with other people and be comfortable getting to know new people. You have to be aware that you do not know this new person and engage openly in conversation about yourself. Finally, you have to be able to quickly recall information about yourself that could come up in casual conversation and may be highly variable depending on the person you are meeting. Memory deficits could negatively impact your access to any or all of this information and result in you being a more difficult persons to get to know. Another example is evident in all employment settings. Specifically, we all build skills within our professions. The accumulation of such knowledge is the result of numerous learning experiences and the memory of information acquired over years. To function successfully in our work environments, we rely on this accumulated knowledge and memory problems would thus inhibit successful work functioning.\n\nOur memories additionally guide our behavior, whether recent or distant. Therefore, if a person is not remembering accurately, behavior may seem bizarre or out of place. For example, an individual may fail to remember a colleague that he or she met at a business conference several times. When he meets this colleague at the next conference and does not remember him/her, he may introduce himself as if they had never met before. The colleague would perceive this as odd, yet the behavior is the result of memory failure.\n\nA third factor to consider is that our everyday actions and routines are largely based on memory. The routine of dropping your child off at school, then going to work is based on your memory of that routine. Any disruption in that routine, such as stopping at the bank prior to going to your office, is reliant on a recent memory that there is a need to stop at the bank. Everyday life is substantially less efficient in the presence of memory dysfunction.\n\nThe examples provided thus far are significant memory lapses. However, even seemingly simple tasks rely on memory. Cooking a favorite recipe, even when written down, relies on memories of what to include a little more of, which pan is best to use, or if it is better to cook the dish just a little longer. The act of doing laundry relies on the memories of how to use your specific washing machine, which red clothes do not run when washed, or whether or not to use bleach with a particular load of laundry. These seemingly insignificant tasks rely on memory for effective execution and when memory falters, such tasks suffer. The impact on the individual can be devastating.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges associated with this research?\n\nMemory is a very challenging construct to research because it is heavily intermingled with so many other aspects of the individual. Most notably, emotional functioning has a substantial impact on memory. A large literature base indicates that depressed individuals have poorer memory abilities. Further, research has shown that when memory improves, depression improves as well. It is thus important to distinguish between these constructs, yet this is difficult as they are intertwined.\n\nVariability in other aspects of cognition similarly creates challenges in evaluating memory abilities and treating memory deficits. Many cognitive capacities, such as attention, working memory and processing speed, form the foundation on which new learning and memory functions operate. For example, a child with Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD) may have poor grades in school. This however, is not because the child is having learning and memory problems that impair the acquisition of new information presented in school. It is rather because the child cannot pay attention sufficiently to allow the information to reach the encoding stage of the memory process. Thus, the child cannot learn and remember the new material due to attention deficits \u2014 NOT due to learning and memory deficits.\n\nIn addition to the consistent influences of other constructs on learning and memory, it also must be appreciated that all of these constructs change over time \u2014 even in healthy persons. That is, we all have days when we are sad and days when we are happier. Many of us contest that we are \u201cmorning people\u201d and thus function better in the mornings \u2014 with our attentional control and learning and memory systems presumably functioning better in the mornings as well. Such individual differences add variability to the assessment of learning and memory, not only between individuals but also within the same individual.\n\nWhen working with individuals with neurological diseases, it is important to note that diseases often fluctuate over time. In MS, for example, individuals often experience exacerbations \u2014 times during which their symptoms are more severe and have a greater impact on their daily functioning. During an exacerbation, cognitive functioning would be expected to be more impaired, improving after the exacerbation. Yet the boundaries of that exacerbation are not always clear \u2014 and sometimes it is not even clear that a given patient might be experiencing an exacerbation at all. Some diseases are additionally known to progress, such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease. With the disease itself changing at the level of the brain, the memory difficulties experienced would be expected to change as well \u2014 yet another source of variability.\n\nHistorical events additionally influence cognition. On the news today we often hear about COVID fatigue \u2014 a sense of mental tiredness related to the Coronavirus pandemic. However, fatigue is also typically associated with depression, as well as memory difficulties. COVID may also bring with it post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \u2014 which similarly entwines with depression and memory deficits. This is similar to what might have been observed in the NY region after the 911 attacks.\n\nWhat advances in neuroscience and public health are you most excited about and why?\n\nThe neuroscience field is rapidly changing, largely due to advances in technology. The field of Neuroimaging is constantly changing with new technologies and new approaches to imaging data analysis every day. These new methodologies provide researchers with a window to the brain \u2014 not only in terms of structure, but also in terms of function. The advances help us understand memory functioning at more intricate levels, furthering our understanding of more minute structures in the brain. We have been increasingly utilizing neuroimaging to evaluate cognitive rehabilitation techniques and understand how they work.\n\nAdvances in Virtual Reality (VR) similarly impact our understanding of cognition and ability to evaluate cognitive rehabilitation. VR technology is increasingly becoming more refined and programmable to accurately reflect everyday life. VR programming allows us to evaluate cognition in an everyday life setting while maintaining consistency in the environment and objectivity in the evaluation. It additionally affords us an opportunity to place cognitive rehabilitation protocols within a daily life setting to increase the generalizability of treatment to daily life \u2014 which is a major need in the treatment of cognitive impairments.\n\nTele-rehabilitation has understandably grown significantly during the past 9 months. This technology has allowed clinicians and researchers to continue to evaluate and treat cognition remotely \u2014 maintaining the required social distancing and minimizing risk of infection. These advances however, are beneficial well beyond the boundaries of the current pandemic. Transportation to clinical appointments has long been a struggle for the disability community and some of my proposed work has addressed the need for remote treatment. Tele-rehabilitation is an exciting advancement that allows us to circumvent the physical disabilities, transportation challenges and infectious control issues that plague the disability community.\n\nWhat is the future of this research?\n\nThis research is primed to have a significant impact on our ability to maintain new learning and memory abilities in many populations of people currently living with impairments in these domains. This includes individuals with neurological diseases such as MS, individuals who have had a trauma to the brain such as traumatic brain injury or stroke, individuals aging and experiencing normal declines in learning and memory, as well as individuals living with dementia. We are making progress in regard to improving learning and memory in these populations but this research is unfortunately slow due to the need for human participation. As we continue to move forward, we will be able to maximize our techniques to increase the benefit to individuals and help more people enjoy greater memory abilities for a longer period of time. Technology only helps us work toward our goal. Through the application of neuroimaging, virtual reality and tele-rehabilitation, we will be able to maximize the efficacy of individual techniques and increase the number of people we can treat with effective techniques.\n\nWhat opportunities do you see on the horizon for this and related research?\n\nGiven the rapidly developing technology, as described above, as well as the dire need to improve learning and memory coupled with the limited capacity to do so to date, the opportunities for growth in this research is substantial. It is important to recognize that memory fails all the time \u2014 even in healthy individuals. There is so much room to improve memory \u2014 we just have to identify the best way to do that. Our failures to date highlight the opportunities for future work.\n\nWhat would enable further advances in this research?\n\nIn addition to the continued technological advances that will continue to advance this field, greater participation of healthy individuals, as well as individuals with neurological diseases, would be a tremendous asset in our ability to answer the questions we pose. Human research is difficult as individuals must consent to the research and commit to spending the time in the ongoing clinical trials. We encourage people to volunteer for our research and greatly appreciate it when they do.\n\nHow does technology influence this work?\n\nNeuroimaging developments in particular have had a significant impact on our ability to identify and understand changes in cognition in the face of neurological illness and injury. Our previous work has identified neurofunctional changes that underlie cognitive deficits in both MS and TBI. In addition, we have shown that treatment with a memory rehabilitation treatment developed at Kessler Foundation, the modified Story Memory Technique (KF-mSMT\u2122) results in increased activity in brain regions known to underlie memory functioning on functional neuroimaging. This technology has thus advanced our knowledge of not only the memory impairment itself, but also the changes in brain function that result from our treatment. Our ongoing work utilizes functional neuroimaging to examine the KF-mSMT\u2122 in other neurological populations (e.g. dementia) and examines neurological changes associated with memory rehabilitation protocols that we have developed more recently.\n\nWhat future research will be enabled by advances in technology?\n\nAdvances in technology will enable us to understand the source of the efficacy of memory treatments and maximize benefit from such treatments. In addition, advances in technologies such as Virtual Reality will allow the development of more advanced cognitive rehabilitation treatments by recreating everyday life in a structured, safe, observable environment. The combination of neuroimaging and virtual reality in one research study would allow us to understand efficient and inefficient daily life functioning at a neurofunctional level. This knowledge can help direct treatment efforts to the symptoms or deficits that have the greatest impact on daily life.\n\nWhat about this work inspires you?\n\nThis is a very exciting line of work. The extent of that which we do not know is inspiring. There are so many questions to ask and research studies to design to answer those questions. We have so much room to improve and grow. The most motivating aspect of this work however is that there are so many people who can be helped. We all would like to improve our memory abilities, but there are people who truly suffer from significantly impaired memory. It is so rewarding when a research participant sends a note of thanks because they were helped by your treatment. There is nothing more inspiring than knowing that the work you do truly improved someone\u2019s life.",

        "title": "5 Top Tips for Creating Business Card Designs",
        "text": "Creating a fantastic business card is not for the faint of heart.\n\nIt takes a lot of determination and skill to make sure your design is the perfect match for your brand \u2014 and to be honest; many business owners still miss the mark.\n\nIt is not that they are trying to make boring business card designs that do not work.\n\nIt is just that they do not know the secret ingredients to a successful business card.\n\nWhat secret ingredients, you ask?\n\nHere five top tips for creating a business card design that is a success with your clients.\n\n1 \u2014 Colour\n\nThe colour is one of the biggest assets of any business card.\n\nIn fact, brightly coloured cards are ten times more successful than plain, white ones.\n\nWhy is colour so effective?\n\nFirst of all, the colour makes your card pop.\n\nIt catches people\u2019s attention from a distance in a way that white space does not.\n\nMoreover, colour is a fabulous marketing tool.\n\nColours each have a set of cultural and emotional associations that help showcase a brand\u2019s personality.\n\nWarm colours tend to create a sense of energy, whereas cool colours are softer and more soothing.\n\nDark colours are a bit more ominous and tend to appeal to men, who typically prefer shades (colours with black added).\n\nColours with white added, also known as tints, are considered more feminine and are preferred by women.\n\nThese overarching associations will help you get a sound basis for your colour palette. You might need a cool shade or a warm tint, for instance.\n\nThen it is time to pick individual colours, and you will soon find that each one has its own unique set of interpretations that will give your card meaning.\n\nWant a bright yellow card?\n\nThat tells people you are cheerful and enthusiastic.\n\nBaby pink?\n\nThat is calm and feminine.\n\nPurple?\n\nYou have got a taste for the finer things in life.\n\nIt goes on \u2014 there\u2019s meaning for every colour.\n\nThere are even shades that work best for certain industries, so be sure to pick the one that speaks to your brand\u2019s identity the most.\n\nNow is a good time to mention one important detail: if you already have brand colours, you should include them on your business card.\n\nThis will help you make sure your clients receive a consistent brand message.\n\nRelated: Personal Branding Tips \u2014 How to Brand Yourself Online\n\n2 \u2014 Texture\n\nIf you think the texture is not important to business cards, think again.\n\nIt is a leading cause of conversions.\n\nSome people will respond to a purely visual design, but a textured card engages multiple senses.\n\nThat helps more potential clients create positive memories of your brand and makes them more likely to contact you in the future.\n\nIn addition to a wealth of business card tips, this graphic reveals that there are three primary ways to give your card texture.\n\nOne is to change up the paper stock.\n\nInstead of a traditional stock \u2014 which tends to be a smooth white paper that\u2019s relatively flimsy \u2014 take the time to find something more unique.\n\nA thick stock or one with a crisp finish makes your card look more creative.\n\nIt also sends the message that you are willing to invest in your marketing and your clients.\n\nRecycled or linen papers are also good options because they have rougher textures that customers will not be expecting.\n\nYou can also create texture with particular imprint methods.\n\nYour printer will be able to help you decide if embossing, foil stamping, or letterpress printing is right for your design.\n\nThe third and final way is to ditch the paper entirely and go for an entirely new manufacturing material.\n\nPeople have made their cards out of things as crazy as:\n\nCotton\n\nBurlap\n\nLeather\n\nMetal\n\nWood\n\nMeat\n\nCrackers\n\nChocolate\n\n3 \u2014 Shape\n\nThe shape can refer to the form of the logo or image that you print on your card \u2014 or it can refer to the shape of the card itself.\n\nCustom die-cuts let you make the card look like literally any object you want.\n\nYou can use them to create a mini product replica, which will remind prospects exactly what you do.\n\nSome printers will even help you make 3D business cards if you pay the right price.\n\nLego, for instance, invested in little Lego people that look like its execs and bear their contact info.\n\nOf course, multiple custom dies are going to cost a bit more than regular ones.\n\nIf you want to save money, it may be a good idea to stick with a simpler geometric shape.\n\nShapes are similar to colours in that each one has its own unique set of psychological associations.\n\nCircles, for instance, are considered in a friendly way because they do not have the sharp edges that many other shapes have.\n\nIf a ring feels a little too perfect, you can stretch it into an oval instead.\n\nRelated: Financial Branding Tips: a Logo Design Guide for the Finance Industry\n\nTriangles are athletic and symbolise motion.\n\nIronically, they are also the perfect design for a pizza place, since they are shaped just like a delicious slice of pepperoni.\n\nSquares have a reputation for their stability since all four sides are equal lengths.\n\nThey have all the properties of a traditional rectangle card \u2014 just with a bit of a twist.\n\nIf you are concerned that an unusual die-cut shape will not work for your business card, that is okay.\n\nYou can also opt for subtle changes, like sides the bulge out slightly, so your card is not a perfect rectangle or round corners in place of standard square ones.\n\n4 \u2014 Layout\n\nThe goal of a business card is to create something so interesting people cannot bear the thought of throwing it away.\n\nBut nobody wants to keep a business card they cannot read.\n\nHaving a good layout is your ticket to an effective business card.\n\nThe first step is to create design hierarchy.\n\nThis means using size and spacing to set the most important elements apart from the rest.\n\nFor example, your company logo design is a vital part of creating brand awareness \u2014 so it needs to be in a larger size.\n\nThis should funnel down to your business name in a slightly smaller size, then your contact info in the smallest size.\n\nBecause even though contact info is important, nobody will use it if he or she is not sure whom they are reaching out to.\n\nThe next step is to allow plenty of white space in the design.\n\nWhile much of the advice on white space refers to web design, the principles that work on a website will work on your business card \u2014 just at a smaller scale.\n\nOne great resource is this post from the Interaction Design Foundation.\n\nIt defines different types of white space (yes, there is more than one) and explains how to choose the proper amount of white space for your design.\n\nThe idea is that, rather than cramming elements into every single area, you should leave open sectors that give the brain a break from trying to process all the info on your card.\n\nIf you are struggling to fit everything on your card, go through your info again.\n\nThere is a good chance you do not actually need all of it.\n\nDon\u2019t think you can take anything out?\n\nPlanning to print on both sides of the card to instantly double your available design space.\n\n5 \u2014 Get Professional Help\n\nRelated: Sources of Design Inspiration\n\nIt does not matter if you have all the right ingredients for a great business card \u2014 your design could still turn into a total disaster if you do not know how to put them all together.\n\nYou will need to have someone help you review your design, whether that is your business partner, employees, or a friend who happens to have some design experience.\n\nHowever, amateur advice will only get you so far.\n\nIf you are serious about creating a real business card, you need to look for a professional Graphic Designer to help you.\n\nSo before you start worrying about the cost, relax.\n\nThere are lots of designers who offer reasonable rates and turn projects around quickly, like this one.\n\nYou can also search for designers by area of expertise.\n\nAfter all, it might be good to get someone who specialises in business card design to help with your, you know, business card.\n\nAnother option: search based experience level.\n\nSometimes the best designers are not the ones who have been in the business longest \u2014 especially since veteran artists may get set in their ways or charge high prices.\n\nInstead of hiring a designer based on what they have already done, look for someone based on what they can do.\n\nThis strategy of recruiting for potential is highly effective because it will help you find someone who is willing to learn about your brand and your needs to create a good business card.\n\nOnce you have found a designer or Branding Agency who meets all your criteria, you are ready to sit down with them to make a creative brief.\n\nThis will arm them with all the info they need to turn your great ideas into a one-of-a-kind business card design!",

        "text": "I Tried Using A.I. To Replicate My Creative Process. It Got Weird.\n\nCan you turn a machine into a novelist?\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nThe speculative-fiction writer Philip K. Dick used amphetamines and other stimulants to transform himself into a 24/7 writing machine. Powered by chemicals, he churned out 28 novels and more than 132 short stories (many of which used drugs as subject matter, including \u201cA Scanner Darkly\u201d). Nor was he alone: If pulp writers didn\u2019t churn out as much copy as possible, they didn\u2019t eat \u2014 and if that meant swallowing pills so you could write for two days straight, so be it.\n\nIn some ways, the writing business hasn\u2019t changed much in the past century. For thousands of writers, the volume of copy you generate is proportional to how much you earn. Drugs are still a way to power through \u2014 I know more than one journalist or blogger who developed a nasty Adderall habit \u2014 but often it\u2019s just a combination of caffeine and desperation.\n\nI\u2019m a journalist and editor who also writes pulp fiction on the side, so I\u2019m as aware of the marketplace dynamics as anyone else in the writing business. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on the evolution of A.I. text generation, which is touted (by businesses) as a way of generating tons of content on the cheap, while derided (by writers) as a potential job killer.\n\nOne of the more prominent A.I. text generators has been GPT-2, a \u201clarge-scale unsupervised language model\u201d created by OpenAI, a semi-nonprofit (it\u2019s complicated) that wants A.I. and machine-learning tools used in virtuous ways. The relatively new GPT-3 is a further refinement of the underlying technology.\n\nWith a training dataset of 8 million web pages (featuring 1.5 billion parameters), GPT-2 was long-touted as capable of achieving \u201cstate-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks.\u201d OpenAI initially refused to unleash it into the wild, fearful that it would be used to generate mountains of \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nLast year, I tried an experiment where I fed GPT-2 a selection of opening lines from some of history\u2019s greatest literary works (including Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d). My conclusion at the time was that the algorithm was capable of sticking with the subject matter for a few lines, but quickly became discombobulated and nonsensical. In other words, although A.I. is already capable of writing short news stories according to a fixed template (such as breakdowns of quarterly financial results), it didn\u2019t seem like writers of longform and fiction pieces really had anything to fear.\n\nThis week, I decided to see how the technology had evolved since my last run-through. Although GPT-3 is out in the ecosystem, and testable, I wanted to try something with the well-established GPT-2: A custom generator.\n\nA standard generator might have scraped text from millions upon millions of web pages in order to power itself, but the results are often mixed: For example, you could feed a GPT-powered platform a couple sentences of Jane Austin, only to have it spit back a mix of 2020 election news, gossip about 18th century British landed gentry, and a mangled Wikipedia entry.\n\nA custom generator, on the other hand, allows you to provide the examples that the system uses to train itself and generate text. InferKit, created by Adam Daniel King, is an evolution of the ultra-popular Talk to Transformer, a public-facing GPT-powered tool that earned a lot of press from Wired and other venues. It also allows you to upload .txt or CSV files, which it then uses as the basis for its custom generator (uploads are capped at 20 MB or 20,000 documents).\n\nFor the purposes of this experiment, I fed InferKit a .txt file containing ~500,000 words of my fiction published over the past ten years, including novels, short stories, and poetry. It took about an hour to digest that data and learn from it. I then fed it a lengthy selection from the crime-fiction novella I\u2019m writing right now:\n\nMiller returned to his tiny apartment on Avenue B. A monk would have found the space nicely minimalist. The mattress on the bedroom floor was the largest piece of furniture. His money, along with an assortment of guns, rested beneath the floorboards of the short hallway that separated the bedroom from the bathroom. On his way home, Miller had stopped at an all-night burger place on Avenue A and ordered the Big Jumbo Delight, two patties slathered with cheese and horseradish mayonnaise. He sat on the mattress, relishing each greasy swallow. The Ricky deal was a mess, because everything Ricky did was a mess. But how had he managed to score that enormous house? Conmen dreamed of that big score, and virtually all of them failed to land it. Yet Ricky, dumb Ricky, had somehow tricked his way into a mansion. Chewing the last bite of burger, Miller told himself that he would return to the townhouse in the morning, learn whatever there was to learn. Ten thousand dollars was nothing to wave off. And if Ricky was promising him that amount, it meant there was a lot more money in the pot. Stripping off his clothes, Miller lay back on the bed, his hands folded behind his head. Pale light from the streetlamps trickled past the barred windows, throwing a maze of shadows over his body. By focusing on his breathing and the faint pulse of his heart, he could drive away his worries about fingerprints and the clown and his patterns and Ricky, drive it all far enough away that he could drift off\u2026 Creak. Oh, you bastard. Creak. Creak. Creak. That old man knew he was home. Creak-creak-creak-creak.\n\n(It\u2019s a first draft; go easy on me.)\n\nHere\u2019s what an A.I. trained on ten years of my writing spat back as the next few paragraphs (I\u2019ve inserted some paragraph breaks in order to give it a human-like flow):\n\nThe clock on the far wall chimed eight minutes too late, the door burst open, and the old man stumbled into the living room. There was a chair on the sofa, the curtains drawn. A pair of sunglasses rested on the coffee table, set on the floor. Rick was nowhere in sight. Miller could hear a faint howl through the walls. The old man stumbled into the coffee table, leaning against it, startled at Miller\u2019s actions. Miller sensed the fear in the man\u2019s eyes, real, but the man had not seen him and yet. Miller waited for his wand, which never did arrive. The old man, his shirt torn, his jeans ripped asunder, walked over to the couch. Rising to his knees, he bent down, brushing against the back of Miller\u2019s neck with his fingertips. That\u2019s a little rough, Miller mused. It was a long way from Grandma\u2019s farmhouse, and Grandma knew it, and you shouldn\u2019t do that to people, the old man thought. Taking the older man\u2019s hand in his own, Miller took the sunglasses from the coffee table, stuffing them into his mouth. \u201cCan I get a cup of coffee?\u201d Miller asked. \u201cYou say I have a parole board?\u201d The old man looked at Miller with dark eyes. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Miller blinked. \u201cYou on parole, are you?\u201d Miller studied the old man\u2019s features, reading his tense face. Dark circles under the dark eyes. And the old man\u2019s mouth. Miller stopped when he noticed blood leaking from the corner of the man\u2019s mouth. The old man reached into his shirt and yanked out the knife with a sad little whine, all purple and bony. Miller was certain the old man had seen him, though the man had none of that violence, no stalking in his victim\u2019s mind. The old man brought the knife up and bit into Miller\u2019s cheek, hard. Miller, looking at the old man as he banged on the table, only saw a good man standing, blood running down his cheeks. Miller\u2019s throat clenched painfully, hard. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d the old man said, spitting the knife out.\n\nObviously, none of that is what I actually intended to write next. It\u2019s not even close, unless I wanted to write some kind of horrific mashup of David Lynch and Robert Coover\u2019s underrated surrealist classic Ghost Town. But here\u2019s the startling thing: It\u2019s a pretty good imitation of my prose style, even if the action is nonsensical. If you want to be charitable, you could describe the GPT-2/InferKit results as \u201cdreamlike,\u201d in the same way that dreams proceed without any adherence to plot mechanics or even basic physics. But if you\u2019re willing to put concerns about logic aside, there\u2019s a smoothness here that suggests A.I. is progressing.\n\nIn many ways, this experiment echoes Google\u2019s Deep Dream, which attempted to use a neural net to \u201clearn\u201d images. That resulted in some very trippy, dreamlike pictures. For example, this is three men in a pool:\n\nObviously, there are still substantial roadblocks before A.I. can comfortably take over fiction writing from human beings. A \u201cgeneral\u201d A.I. (i.e., a \u201chuman-like\u201d one; think HAL in 2001) would know that a human shouldn\u2019t stuff sunglasses in their mouth. But these specialized, learning A.I.s that are filling our current world have no idea of existence beyond their highly specialized input; there\u2019s no meta-awareness, no sense of structure.\n\nAnd that sense of structure, of the broader world, is what is going to protect fiction writers for quite some time to come. Writers must make intuitive leaps; they (hopefully) have an instinctive sense of their work\u2019s structure and its ultimate goal. Or as Nabokov put it, when discussing the writing of Lolita:\n\n\u201cThese are the nerves of the novel. These are the secret points, the subliminal co-ordinates by means of which the book is plotted \u2014 although I realize very clearly that these and other scenes will be skimmed over or not noticed, or never even reached.\u201d\n\nThese are nuances that necessarily elude the machines. You could upload all of Nabokov or Philip K. Dick to a platform running GPT-2 or GPT-3, and you might get a facsimile of their style and tone, but you wouldn\u2019t get the structure or creativity. Humans writing press releases might have good reason to be frightened for their jobs over the next five years, but novelists may not have cause for concern for decades, if ever.\n\nOne marvels, though, at what Dick, high and feverish and smacking away at his typewriter keys, might have one with the concept of text predictors. Do androids dream of becoming great novelists?",

They have fundamentally changed the development and deployment process and been adopted by software teams of all sizes, and for good reason.\n\nDocker makes it considerably easier to create, deploy, and run applications with the use of containers, and Kubernetes takes it to the next level by managing containers for you and scaling your application as and when required.\n\nOne of my goals this year is to master Docker and Kubernetes, How about you? I am sure you had made goals when this year started, but if not, you can still check out 10 Things Java developers can learn in 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late. From my experience with interacting with many software developers, it seems DevOps is the top priority for many programmers. I have been receiving a lot of queries, emails, and chats about how to learn Docker and Kubernetes, two of the most popular DevOps tools.\n\nWhen it comes to learning, nothing beats personal training, but that\u2019s not always feasible; hence we need to rely on self-learning using books and online courses, and that\u2019s what I will suggest to you in this article.\n\nUntil, a couple of years back, I was a big fan of books, but nowadays, I am using more and more online courses to get up-to-speed with new technology. They seem to better cover the 20% important part of the technology, which is used 80% of the time.\n\nAnyway, If you don\u2019t know what Docker and Kubernetes are, let me give you a brief summary before I suggest you some online courses to learn Docker and Kubernetes in 2021.\n\nIn simple words, Docker is a container where you can run your application without worrying about hardware and operating system versions, which makes it easy to spin off a new environment without worrying about config details. It provides both containers and a command-line tool to manage those containers while Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that manages your container effectively.\n\nKubernetes is arguably the most crucial container management technology in the world and used a lot in a real production environment where you have many containers to manage.\n\nIt\u2019s essential from the scalability perspective and also to manage your resources effectively. Even though it\u2019s not from Google, Its origin is. It\u2019s created as an open-source by engineers who work on a similar tool in Google. You can understand that if it can work on the scale of Google, it\u2019s definitely well tried and tested.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll share some of the best online courses from Udemy to learn Docker and Kubernetes, but if you are in a hurry and just want to join one class, then the Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide by Stephen Grider is the best one to start with.\n\n15 Best Online Courses to learn Docker, AWS, and Kubernetes\n\nWithout wasting any more of your time, here is my list of some of the best courses to learn Docker and Kubernetes in 2021. These courses are created by an expert in the DevOps area who have real-world experience in using these tools.\n\nThis is one of the comprehensive course to learn DevOps along with both Docker and Kubernetes. In this course, you will learn how to build, test, and deploy Docker applications with Kubernetes.\n\nThe course starts from scratch, i.e. no previous experience with Docker or Kubernetes is required. Along the course, you will build a CI + CD pipeline from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS.\n\nYou will not only understand the purpose and theory of Kubernetes by building a complex app but also master the Docker CLI to inspect and debug running containers.\n\nThis is another great course to learn Docker on Pluralsight. In this course, you will not only learn the fundamentals of Docker and containers but also some advanced features like Swarm mode, services, and stacks.\n\nYou\u2019ll start with installing Docker on the most common development and production platforms \u2014 Windows and Mac laptops, Windows Server, and Linux.\n\nAfter this course, you\u2019ll be up and running a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Docker, along with some game-changing features.\n\nThis is a great online course to learn Docker from scratch by Nigel Poulton. IF you don\u2019t know Nigel, he is a Docker Captain and popular technology author. He is known for his engaging videos and books on cloud-native technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nIn this course you will with installing Docker on the most common development and production platforms \u2014 Windows and Mac laptops, Windows Server 2016, and Linux.\n\nAfter that, you\u2019ll get to see some fundamental concepts of containers and images, including how to perform common management tasks.\n\nYou\u2019ll also spend a good deal of time covering all the new stuff introduced with Docker 1.12, including Swarm mode, services, scaling, rolling updates, stacks, and distributed application bundles.\n\nAfter completing this course, you\u2019ll be up and running with some of the game-changing improvements announced with Docker 1.12 and have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Docker.\n\nThis is a great course to learn Docker programmers and developers on The Educative Team, an interactive coding platform that provides text and image-based courses for faster learning.\n\nIf you prefer a text-based course then this is a great course to learn Docker in 2021, particularly for programmers and developers.\n\nThis is another course from Educative, and you can join this course along with the previous one for learning both Docker and Kubernetes. As I said, the site is great if you prefer a text-based, learn-by-doing approach. Reading is always faster than watching and if you get bored watching videos, you should try this platform in 2021 for your online learning.\n\nIn this course, you\u2019ll start with the fundamentals of Kubernetes and what the main components of a cluster look like. You\u2019ll then learn how to use those components to build, test, deploy, and upgrade applications, as well as how to achieve state persistence once your application is deployed.\n\nAs a platform, Educative also has some of the best courses to prepare for coding interviews like Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions and Grokking the system design interview.\n\nIt also has a lot of free resources like this free JavaScript tutorial to learn essential technologies. You can register for this course for free but if you like to take full advantage of the platform, I suggest you go for Educative Subscription, which costs $18(50% discount now) monthly, completely worth it for a programmer and software engineers where continuous learning is required.\n\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to secure your deployments and manage resources, which are crucial DevOps skills.\n\nThis is another fantastic course to learn Docker by Nigel, especially if you want to learn Docker in-depth.\n\nIn Docker Deep Dive, you\u2019ll go from zero-to-Docker by learning everything you need to know to take your career to the next level and give you the confidence to start working with containers.\n\nThis course is also good if you are preparing for Docker Certified Associate Exam as after completing this course you\u2019ll be prepared for most of the topics presented on the Docker Certified Associate exam, and be ready to work with containers.\n\nThis is another great course for people looking to learn Kubernetes in 2021. It is yet another gem from Nigel Poulton, author of the previous two Docker courses.\n\nIn this course, you\u2019ll learn the fundamentals of Kubernetes and the \u2018Kubernetes way\u2019. First, you\u2019ll dive into Kubernetes architecture, what the main components and services are, and how they come together to build a production-class container infrastructure.\n\nAfter that, you\u2019ll learn how to install and deploy Kubernetes on several cloud platforms. Finally, you\u2019ll delve into working with pods, deployments, and services.\n\nBy the end of this course, you\u2019ll have a solid understanding of what Kubernetes is and how it works, as well as skills to deploy a Kubernetes cluster and simple applications.\n\nBtw, you would need a Pluralsight membership to get access to this course, which costs around $29 per month or $299 annually (14% discount).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have Pluralsight membership, I encourage you to get one because it allows you to access their 5000+ online courses on all the latest topics like front-end and back-end development, machine learning, etc. It also includes interactive quizzes, exercises, and the latest certification material.\n\nIt\u2019s more like Netflix for Software Developers and Since learning is an important part of our job, Pluralsight membership is a great way to stay ahead of your competition.\n\nPluralsight also has a 10-day free trial without any commitment, which is a great way to not just access this course for free but also to check the quality of courses before joining Pluralsight.\n\nThis is the best online course to learn Kubernetes in depth. As you already know that Kubernetes can run and manage your containerized applications.\n\nThis course will teach you how to build, deploy, use, and maintain Kubernetes.\n\nYou will learn how to install and configure Kubernetes (on your laptop/desktop or production-grade cluster on AWS).\n\nAfter this course, you should be able to run both stateless and stateful applications on Kubernetes.\n\nThis course provides the beginner level introduction to Docker, the most famous DevOps tool. The course is entirely hands-on, so you will not just learn or listen but do a lot of exercises to actually practice the stuff you are learning.\n\nFirst, you will learn basic Docker commands with hands-on exercises, and then you will learn how to build Docker images using Dockerfiles.\n\nYou will also learn Docker Swarm and Docker Compose and build an application stack using Docker Compose Files.\n\nIn short, a complete Docker course for beginners with lots of hands-on exercises.\n\nThis is one of the best courses to learn practical AWS you will find online. This course is created by a former Amazon engineer with 15 years of experience working on AWS.\n\nThis is not your typical AWS reference course. You won\u2019t find most of the knowledge that\u2019s shared here in the AWS docs. The goal here is to help you realize which AWS features you\u2019d be foolish not to use \u2014 features that have passed the test of time by being at the backbone of most things on the Internet.\n\nIn this course, you\u2019ll learn a technique used to help make reliable technical choices without getting paralyzed in the face of so many options. You\u2019ll start by going through the most fundamental services AWS offers such as DynamoDB, S3, EC2. Each section breaks down how it\u2019s used, the pros and cons, why you should (or shouldn\u2019t) be using it, and more.\n\nHere is the link to sign up for this course \u2014 The Good Parts of AWS: Cutting Through the Clutter\n\nYou can either buy this course or you can get and Educative membership to access this course. If you ask me, I suggest you get Educative Subscription which costs $17(50% discount now) monthly, completely worth it for a programmer and software engineers where continuous learning is required. Thanks to The Educative Team for this awesome course.\n\nThis course is also available as e-Book on Gumroad, if you like to read books then you can also check out The Good Parts of AWS eBook. There is a 20% discount available if you buy the book using this link.\n\nDocker provides containers, but they can quickly become messy if you don\u2019t manage them. Kubernetes provides a way to manage them.\n\nKubernetes has emerged as one of the most essential and exciting container management platforms, and in this course, you\u2019ll learn the fundamentals of Kubernetes and the \u2018Kubernetes way.\u2019\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll learn Kubernetes architecture and understand the main components and services, and how they come together to build a production-class container infrastructure.\n\nAfter that, you\u2019ll learn how to install and deploy Kubernetes on several cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to work with pods, deployments, and services.\n\nAfter finishing this course, you\u2019ll have a solid understanding of what Kubernetes is and how it works, as well as skills to deploy a Kubernetes cluster and simple applications.\n\nThat\u2019s all about some of the best courses to learn about Docker and Kubernetes, two of the most important tools for DevOps engineers. As I have said, Docker provides a container which has now become a standard way to deploy your application because it abstracts a lot of setup stuff. You don\u2019t need to worry about inconsistencies in OS, DB version, etc. between the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, Kubernetes is the best container management technology, and you will definitely need it if you are going to use containers in production.\n\nAll these courses are excellent, but you should join the one which suits you better. I put a lot of focus on the Instructor\u2019s style, and whether I can connect to him or not, hence I suggest you to join the course where you can connect with the instructor. If you just need one class, make that to Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide, merely the best course to learn both Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nOther Programming Resources you may like\n\nThanks for reading so far. If you like these Docker and Kubernetes courses, then please share them with your friends and colleagues. If you have any questions or feedback, then please drop a note.\n\nP.

        "title": "The 5 Tips to Tell Better Stories with Data",
        "text": "Data visualization \u2014 and communicating with data in general \u2014 sits at the intersection of science and art. There is certainly some science to it: best practices and guidelines to follow. But there is also an artistic component. This is one of the reasons this area is so much fun. It is inherently diverse. Different people will approach things in varying ways and come up with distinct solutions to the same data visualization challenge. Recently, I finished reading Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic\u2019s Storytelling with Data \u2014 a superbly written, masterful display of rare art in the business world. This book is a straightforward, accessible guide that will help anyone who communicates with data connect more effectively with their audience. Below are the top 5 tips she shared in the last chapter that I found to be a great recap of the book.\n\nTip #1 \u2014 Learn your tools well\n\nTry not to let your tools be a limiting factor when it comes to communicating effectively with data. Pick one and get to know it as best with the basics may be helpful. You don\u2019t need fancy tools in order to visualize data well. There are a plethora of tools out there. The following is a very quick rundown of some of the popular ones currently used for creating data visualizations:\n\nGoogle spreadsheets are free, online, and sharable, allowing multiple people to edit.\n\nare free, online, and sharable, allowing multiple people to edit. Tableau is a popular out-of-the-box data visualization solution that can be great for exploratory analysis because it allows you to quickly create multiple views and nice-looking graphs form your data. It can be leveraged for the explanatory via the Story Points feature. It is expensive, though a free Tableau Public option is available if uploading your data to a public server isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nis a popular out-of-the-box data visualization solution that can be great for exploratory analysis because it allows you to quickly create multiple views and nice-looking graphs form your data. It can be leveraged for the explanatory via the Story Points feature. It is expensive, though a free Tableau Public option is available if uploading your data to a public server isn\u2019t an issue. Programming languages \u2014 like R, D3, and Python \u2014 have a steeper learning curve but allow for greater flexibility, since you can control the specific elements of the graphs you create and make those specifications repeatable through code.\n\nand \u2014 have a steeper learning curve but allow for greater flexibility, since you can control the specific elements of the graphs you create and make those specifications repeatable through code. Some people use Adobe Illustrator, either one or together with graphs created in an application like Excel or via a programming language, for easier manipulation of graph elements and a professional look and feel.\n\nTip #2 \u2014 Iterate and seek feedback\n\nIt takes iterating to get from early ideas to a final solution. When the best course for visualizing a certain data is unclear, start with a blank piece of paper. This enables you to brainstorm without the constraints of your tools or what you know how to do in your tools. Sketch out potential views to see them side-by-side and determine what will work best for getting your message across to your audience.\n\nAt any point, if the best path is unclear, seek feedback. The fresh set of eyes that a friend or colleague can bring to the data visualization endeavor is invaluable. Show someone else your visual and have them talk you through their thought process: what they pay attention to, what observations they make, what questions they have, and any ideas they may have for better getting your point across. These insights will let you know if the visual you\u2019ve created is on the mark or, in the case when it isn\u2019t, give you an idea of where to make changes and focus continued iteration.\n\nWhen it comes to iterating, there is one thing you need perhaps more than anything else in order to be successful: time.\n\nTip #3 \u2014 Devote time to storytelling with data\n\nIt takes time to build a robust understanding of the context, time to understand what motivates the audience, time to craft the 3-minute story and form the Big Idea. It takes time to look at the data in different ways and determine how to best show it. It takes time to declutter and draw attention and iterate and seek feedback and iterate some more to create an effective visual. It takes time to pull it all together into a story and form a cohesive and captivating narrative.\n\nIt takes even more time to do well the most important step: communicating your work, as that is the only part of the entire process that your audience actually sees. Expect it to take longer than you think to allow sufficient time to iterate and get it right.\n\nTip #4 \u2014 Seek inspiration through good examples\n\nImitation really is the best form of flattery. If you see a data visualization or example of storytelling with data that you like, consider how you might adapt the approach of your own use. Pause to reflect on what makes it effective. Make a copy of it and create a visual library that you can add to over time and refer to for inspiration. Emulate the good examples and approaches that you see.\n\nSaid more provocatively \u2014 imitation is a good thing. We learn by emulating experts. That\u2019s why you see people with their sketchpads and easels at art museums \u2014 they are interpreting great works. There are a number of great blogs and resources on the topic of data visualization and communicating with data that contain many good examples. I personally would suggest you start with the Data Visualization Society.\n\nTip #5 \u2014 Have fun and find your style\n\nWhen most people think about data, one of the furthest things from their mind is creativity. But within data visualization, there is absolutely space for creativity to play a role. Data can be made to be breathtakingly beautiful. Don\u2019t be afraid to try new approaches and play a little. You\u2019ll continue to learn what works and what doesn\u2019t over time.\n\nTo the extent that it makes sense given the task at hand, don\u2019t be afraid to let your own style develop and creativity comes through when you communicate with data. Company brand can also play a role in developing a data visualization style; consider your company\u2019s brand and whether there are opportunities to fold that into how you visualize and communicate with data. Just make sure that your approach and stylistic elements are making the information easier \u2014 not more difficult \u2014 for your audience to consume.\n\nThe book is written for anyone who needs to communicate something to someone using data. This includes: analysts sharing the results of their work, students visualizing thesis data, managers needing to communicate in a data-driven way, philanthropists proving their impact, and leaders informing their board. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve their ability to communicate effectively with data. This is an intimidating space for many, but it does not need to be.",

        "title": "Discomfort Shows Us The Way",
        "text": "Discomfort Shows Us The Way\n\nWe only feel uncomfortable about what we really care about\n\nWe are programmed by modern society to seek comfort.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with that, asceticism with no goal is as much a pointless exercise in the egotism of denial as hedonism is in the egotism of plenty.\n\nBut seeking comfort is normal because discomfort is a precursor to pain and pain is a precursor to injury. So avoiding discomfort is a protective mechanism.\n\nThe trouble arises because we also feel discomfort when we do something new because new is unknown and our default setting is to mistrust the unknown.\n\nEven if the unknown may be better, we are hardwired to assume that the unknown is worse than our present situation since being over-prepared is better than being under-prepared. We are already dealing with the devil we know. But the unknown could be a worse devil that we are not able to handle.\n\nThis conservatism can be a hindrance if we allow it to dominate our decision making.\n\nJust because pain is a precursor to injury doesn\u2019t mean that pain always leads to injury. When we are working out our muscles to get stronger, we often feel pain, but that pain is a sign of our stretching ourselves beyond what we can do.\n\nGrowth of any kind means exactly that: moving beyond what you can do and into the unknown. So while discomfort is always a warning to be on the lookout for injury that just means being more alert. It doesn\u2019t mean that injury is inevitable.\n\nOur unconscious bias to treat the unknown as dangerous turns comfort into a goal rather than a measure. We treat discomfort as a sign of something actually wrong rather than a measure of the possibility of something wrong, again because we\u2019re instinctually going to assume the worst.\n\nHow comfortable or uncomfortable something is definitely needs to be something we should pay attention to. But eliminating all discomfort means eliminating all possibility for growth.\n\nBy pushing beyond what we can do now we ratchet ourselves up. Discomfort is not a sign of something going wrong in this case, it is a sign that you are pushing the limits of where you currently are. If you are satisfied with where you are, then avoiding discomfort is fine but if you want to grow or change your circumstances then you need to do something new\n\nAnd furthermore, the things that you are uncomfortable about are the things that you really care about. So following your discomfort will also help you discover the path you really want to be on.\n\nThis means that if we want to change, we should actually seek out discomfort. We should view discomfort as a sign of something that we should be doing rather than of something we should be avoiding.\n\nWe should still be careful, we should still be alert for injury because change carries with it the risk for injury (even if that injury is not physical). But in our modern society, \u201cgoing out of our comfort zone\u201d is generally something positive since we no longer live in a world were fatal mistakes are common.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s recognize that this is easier said than done.\n\nWe are both so hard-wired and so conditioned to avoid discomfort that even if we intellectually realize that we should lean into and maybe even search out discomfort, at some level we still think that being uncomfortable is wrong\n\nIn fact we are so hard-wired this way that when we talk about being courageous and going out of our comfort zone, at some level we are actually still motivated by the desire to reduce our discomfort. We are not happy or satisfied by our current situation and it is that greater discomfort of feeling like a failure that pushes us to overcome the lesser discomfort of change.\n\nSo rather than going out of our comfort zone we are merely expanding our understanding of our comfort zone. We are still being driven by the seeking of comfort and the need to eliminate anything which makes us uncomfortable\n\nWhile this approach often results in an initial action, it is rarely sustainable. We overcome the discomfort of our immediate situation only to land in a new \u201ccomfort zone\u201d that lasts only as long as it takes for us to become dissatisfied again.\n\nNothing has fundamentally changed.\n\nWe get frustrated because we are simply going from one discomfort to another with a brief respite of illusory comfort in between. That is progress but it is not momentum: we have to continually be putting in personal energy and attention to get moving every time we stop. It\u2019s the difference between jumping and flying.\n\nBut if instead we work to eliminate the avoidance of discomfort as a core motivation and focus on our goals and desires, we can shift towards making sustainable progress.\n\nTo do this we need to treat discomfort as a measure and not a goal. We need to do is make peace with discomfort, accept it as a companion not as something we \u201cdeal with\u201d.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean ignoring it. We can\u2019t pretend it is not there, we cannot eliminate it, we can only live with it. The distinction is that ignoring it means that we can pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. But it is too foundational a mechanism and so impossible to ignore.\n\nInstead we must shift to acceptance. Accepting something means acknowledging it but not engaging with it, not trying to change it.\n\nWe respect our discomfort as coming from a place that is trying to prevent harm. Be kind to ourselves, acknowledge that discomfort comes from the care we have for ourselves.\n\nWe can\u2019t pretend that the pain it causes us doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not about aggressively pushing through the pain. Instead we need to recognize that pain and be compassionate to ourselves about feeling it but also be firm.\n\nFeeling fear and pain about taking a step towards your dreams just means you are human. But pain is not the same as injury.\n\nIn fact, shifting to this attitude that discomfort is to be accepted and not eliminated will itself help you to work through the discomfort you feel about accepting your discomfort!\n\nSo when we feel uncomfortable, accept it, embrace it even, but then continue on anyway. Be grateful that you feel discomfort because that means that you still care about something. Say \u201cthanks for your concern, thanks for pointing that out, self. But now I\u2019m going to do this anyway.\u201d\n\nStart small. going out of your comfort zone is going out of your comfort zone no matter how small. But start today.\n\nIf you want to stop working and check out youtube, just work an extra 5 minutes. If you are worried about talking in front of people, say hi to someone as you exit a coffee shop. If you\u2019re trying to write the next great novel, just write anything for 15 minutes every day despite still worrying about whether it is any good.\n\nPractice embracing discomfort and it will lead you down the pathway to success.",

        "text": "Researchers from China have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that can diagnose congenital cataracts as accurately as ophthalmologists.\n\nWhat is Cataract?\n\nA cataract is clouding of the natural lens of the eye. It is extremely common among the elderly population but can also affect infants at birth or develop at a young age.\n\n\u201cIn children, cataract causes more visual disability than any other form of treatable blindness. Children with untreated, visually significant cataracts face a lifetime of blindness at tremendous quality of life and socioeconomic costs to the child, the family, and the society\u201d- American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO).\n\nDetecting Cataracts in Children:\n\nThe asymptomatic progression of pediatric cataracts makes it difficult for early detection. Not to mention that young kids can\u2019t really express themselves. However, catching the disease early is critical; late diagnosis often result in poor visual outcomes.\n\nProblems:\n\nDiagnosis requires expertise, especially in children and neonates.\n\nThere is a relatively small number of ophthalmologists for the size of our population; with an even smaller number of pediatric ophthalmologists.\n\nExperts are concentrated in specialized centers but their coverage is largely insufficient.\n\nRural areas get almost no coverage.\n\nThis lack of accessibility causes lifetime vision loss to affected children.\n\nSolution: AI\n\nA team in China tried to address the problem of lack of pediatric ophthalmologists by using Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks. They built an AI machine, CC-Cruiser, that has three main functions: 1) Diagnosis 2) Risk stratification 3) Treatment suggestions.\n\nScreening for Congenital Cataract using Artificial Intelligence\n\nTheir initial work was done on congenital cataract cases only (amongst other types of pediatric cataracts) but further studies are ongoing.\n\nFuture: AI requires Big Data\n\nA cloud-based platform has been created for multi-hospital collaboration; Doctors at hospitals around the country can access the platform and upload patient images. More data will be collected this way, which is essential to AI\u2019s learning and fine-tuning.\n\n\u201cThe limited resources of patients and the isolation of the data in individual hospitals represent a bottleneck in data usage.

        "title": "I\u2019m Not an Introvert \u2014 I Have Social Anxiety",
        "text": "I used to call myself an introvert. I thought of myself as a loner who\u2019d rather stay home playing video games than go out to big parties. Just the thought of spending too much time around other people exhausted me.\n\nThe trouble with this was that I didn\u2019t actually enjoy spending time by myself. A night spent reading in my room didn\u2019t leave me feeling excited and refreshed; it left me lonely and depressed.\n\nSo, I ended up feeling awful no matter what I did. I could go out with friends and feel awkward all night, or stay in and be miserable.\n\nMy solution was often to turn to substance abuse. I\u2019d drink and smoke cigarettes, which would provide a temporary cure in both situations. When I was in public, it would reduce my self-consciousness and let me enjoy myself. When I was at home, it would make the hours pass more quickly.\n\nOf course, this tactic created far more problems than it solved. I ended up developing addictions to both alcohol and nicotine, and I was no closer to understanding myself.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until sobering up and going to therapy that I grasped the underlying issue: I had been mistaking social anxiety for introversion.\n\nSocially Anxious Extroverts\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with anxiety issues my entire life, but it took me a long time to realize how severely they were affecting my social life. I often wrote off symptoms of anxiety because I thought they were simply traits of introversion.\n\nIn social situations, I constantly worried about coming across as weird or off-putting. I struggled to interact with people because I was so caught up worrying about myself.\n\nI\u2019d often spend entire parties on the balcony, chain-smoking cigarettes as an excuse to avoid crowds. When I did go inside, I\u2019d hover near the wall or try to get into one-on-one conversations in quiet areas. I also often went for the classic move of playing with the host\u2019s pets.\n\nI\u2019ve seen all these actions described as introversion, so I just assumed that\u2019s what it was. I thought that I was nervous at parties because I liked being by myself more. I never took the time to think about whether that was really the case.\n\nThe truth was that my reaction to social situations went far beyond mere introversion. I often panicked before leaving my house, running to the bathroom multiple times because I was so nervous. When I was forced into crowds, I\u2019d have trouble thinking. I even experienced some physical discomfort, like sweaty palms and an uneasy stomach. I missed these clear signs that something was wrong.\n\nWhen I finally took the time to reflect on what I really enjoyed, I realized that I\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m with other people. It\u2019s just that being with others makes me nervous at the same time.\n\nComing to this realization was like a breath of fresh air. Even though I didn\u2019t see any immediate solutions, by finally understanding the real problem, I could see that there was hope.\n\nBeing a socially anxious extrovert is tough \u2014 there are two competing emotions pulling in opposite directions. It\u2019s helpful, however, to understand that the anxiety is the issue, not the extroversion.\n\nI don\u2019t have any easy hacks to make social anxiety disappear. It\u2019s an issue that I\u2019ve been working on for several years, through therapy and on my own, and made gradual but significant progress with.\n\nI think the most helpful thing has simply been exposure. I\u2019ve tried to frequently put myself in social situations, so that I can train my brain to realize that I don\u2019t need alcohol or cigarettes to get through them. It\u2019s been a bit more difficult as everything has shifted online this year, but I\u2019m still trying to find ways to interact with others regularly.\n\nThe Importance of Self-Reflection\n\nPlenty of introverts really are introverts, and that\u2019s okay. More power to them! But, I\u2019m sure there are many others like me who are just overlooking their social anxiety. It\u2019s worth the time to reflect and ask yourself what you really prefer.\n\nAre you staying home to read because you love reading, or because the thought of interacting with other people makes your palms sweat? If it\u2019s the later, a talk with a therapist might help you discover whether you\u2019re really an introvert, or just an extrovert with social anxiety.\n\nThis type of self-reflection is vital because it allows you to find a path that will lead to actual happiness, rather than an avoidance of your problems.\n\nWhen I thought I was introverted, it led to a lot of lonely and depressing nights. By realizing that my problem arose from social anxiety, I was able to start addressing it. That has led to a huge improvement in my happiness and well-being.",

        "text": "What is your single, most important piece of advice for succeeding on Medium for the long haul?\n\nI\u2019ve been writing on Medium since early 2017 \u2014 so more than three years. I started before writers were paid to write here. I realized, almost instantly, that using Medium as my blog was a better idea that writing on my own website for one reason.\n\nThere\u2019s an audience here. When I wrote on Medium and when I did it with consistency \u2014 my posts were read. I could reach out to my own audience, and while doing that, reach a new audience.\n\nFrom the beginning, I knew that Medium was a good tool. Getting paid directly for my work was a nice added feature. But I was already being paid, because I captured the audience Medium helped me reach and built my business around those people.\n\nThe most important advice isn\u2019t about how you write.\n\nThere are things that are really important, if you want to succeed on Medium (if we\u2019re going to count success as earning a decent amount of income and/or having a solid following.)\n\nHere\u2019s a non-exhaustive list:\n\nHeadlines\n\nPhotos (and making sure they\u2019re cited)\n\nMaking sure your post\u2019s format matches Medium\u2019s aesthetic.\n\nConsistency\n\nBuilding up a good backlog of stories\n\nPatience\n\nThose things are all very, very important. But they\u2019re all mechanics. Get those under control and you\u2019ll be writing in a way that aligns with Medium. It\u2019s not much different from learning what any other publication wants and then providing that to them.\n\nWhen I think about all of the people who I talk to about being frustrated that Medium isn\u2019t having the impact they want \u2014 and it\u2019s a lot of people \u2014 there is one thing that stands out to me.\n\nThey let Medium own their audience.\n\nMy single most important piece of advice for success at Medium over the long haul is to start working, right from the beginning, on building your own audience. Don\u2019t count on Medium to do that for you.\n\nLook. This is your business. Medium has its own business and it\u2019s different from yours. They align in some ways. They\u2019re symbiotic. But their business is to bring lots of writers together to create a reading experience to millions of humans. Your business is to do that writing \u2014 for your own readers.\n\nHave a way of capturing the readers who really enjoy your work, so that you can let them know when you\u2019ve written and about other projects that come up for you.\n\nAn email list is your best friend. Truly. You should also have a publication on Medium where you can collect your work and readers can follow you. You should know who your ideal reader is so that you know you\u2019re speaking to them when you write.\n\nBecause Medium can be relatively volatile as far as income sources for writers go. Their algorithm changes or they switch up how they structure their pay system \u2014 and it all screws up with your best laid plans.\n\nAdvice number one: Make building an email list, and learning how to use it, a top priority.\n\nIf you have your own audience, then you\u2019re in control.\n\nMy second most important piece of advice for success at Medium over the long haul, by the way, is to consider Medium a tool and not the sole source of your writing career. It\u2019s a stream, not the whole ocean, you know?\n\nIf you have your own audience, then you can use Medium as a tool for reaching the goals you set for yourself. And if Medium ever stops being the best tool for that job, you\u2019ll be able to pivot relatively easily because your audience is yours.\n\nAnd if you think about Medium as just one tool in your long-haul writing-career box, then you\u2019ll be using others as well. Like self-publishing or writing on your own website or coaching or teaching or freelance writing or . . .\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nAdvice number two (because I\u2019m all about over-delivering!): Consider Medium an income stream, not the whole of your business.",

        "title": "Warning! Unsupervised Neuroscience Ahead",
        "text": "The warning: Care is needed. We are experts at finding patterns in noise, and so are our algorithms.\n\nTake clustering. The problem with clustering is that it returns clusters. I mean, I know that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to do, but that\u2019s actually the problem. Give a clustering algorithm the phone numbers of everyone in Llandudno, ask it to find four clusters in the data, and it will. Now you have four clusters of Welsh people, and are none the wiser as to what to do with them, and neither are they. The mere existence of clusters does not mean there is actual cluster structure in the data.\n\nUnsupervised algorithms are about making sense of data for us, the observer. What they find does not have to coincide with reality. Reality doesn\u2019t have a ground-truth, because it does not have clean, neat carves at the joints except in special cases. And most of those special cases are from artificial systems, with the joints built in. Run a different clustering algorithm on your data, and you\u2019ll get different clusters; run a different dimension reduction algorithm on your data, and you\u2019ll get different dimensions. As Ulrike von Luxburg and friends have so clearly argued, clustering is an art.\n\nThe unsupervised organisation of data is just a description of that data. Just because we can cluster neurons into groups doesn\u2019t mean there exists actual meaningful groups of neurons in the brain; just because we can cluster behaviour into discrete elements \u2014 into states, motifs, syllables, or whatever term you prefer \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean behaviour is actually discrete. To find that it means something, we have to link that discovered organisation to reality, show it has meaning. In neuroscience, that typically means we have to link that organisation of data to something happening in the world, or elsewhere in the brain, or both.\n\nAnd that acid test is passed by the best attempts at unsupervised neuroscience. In the paper from Alon and friends, they showed the neurons\u2019 \u201ctuning\u201d to the hippocampus\u2019 internal dynamics had meaning as location in space (and repeated the same trick for neurons that code for head direction in the rodent thalamus). In the study from Adam Kepecs\u2019 lab on the orbitofrontal cortex, their discrete groups of neurons in turn each encoded a meaningful variable in the decision-making process. Even better, they re-did the whole analysis with another cohort of animals with more neurons, reusing all parameters from first cohort, and ended up with the same results. These studies could show us a mapping between the unsupervised structure of the data and the real world.\n\nTerrific work, but those are the \u201ceasy\u201d ways of doing unsupervised neuroscience \u2014 by relating what we found to what we already know. We already know that hippocampus has place cells, and that there is a head direction system in the rodent thalamus. We already know the neurons in orbitofrontal cortex are heavily implicated in decision making, and to work out what their groups of neurons were encoding Kepec\u2019s lab interpreted their activity as the variables within a mathematical model of decision making. If that model is wrong, the mapping between variables and activity is of little consequence in building our confidence that the clustered neurons are really there. And others, of course, may find different answers: when Anne Churchland\u2019s group went looking for discrete groups of coding neurons in posterior parietal cortex, for example, they found none.\n\nThe ultimate test for unsupervised neuroscience is discoveries that could not be found any other way. There are some examples of that too. For example, we took large-scaling recordings of neurons in the motor system of the venerable sea-slug Aplysia. Using a fully-unsupervised pipeline to analyse that data we discovered its motor system was doubly discrete: on one level, groups of neurons with correlated activity were laid out contiguously in the motor system, beautifully tesselating the bit of brain they were in. On another level, mass populations of neurons with clearly different dynamics were in different parts of the motor system, including a distinct population of oscillating neurons in one spot that were most likely the pattern generating network for movement \u2014 a discovered hypothesis waiting to be tested. Joshua Vogelstein and friends discovered a richly detailed map of the relationship between neural activity and the resulting behaviour of Drosophila maggots, by individually stimulating each of 1054 types of neurons, videoing the behaviour, and clustering it. They thus revealed 29 different types of behaviour and which neurons drove each. But these are discoveries of relationships, of structure; they are not yet that final step of unsupervised discovery of a theory for how a bit of brain works.",

        "text": "Technology Hits\n\nThe New Think Tank\n\nDigital art with permission to use by Igor Morski\n\nFor those who enjoy the infinite, technology is their cosmic playground. For hundreds of years, humans ascertained the unconceivable as technology grew exponentially. Many science fiction buffs remember that H.G. Wells's prediction of the use of wireless communications, genetic science, email, and the World Wide Web (Handwerk, 2016). The very idea of technology is basking in the endless possibilities that remain undiscovered.\n\nAnd while the world waits for the next technological trend, Technology Hits invites you to write, read and seek out opportunities in diverse technology subjects that abound. We formally invite you to become an inventor on our page, bring ideas to life, and discuss the unimaginable with a soiree of other like-minded techies, who really are the leaders of the future.\n\nThe Purpose\n\nSilicon Valley may be the nesting ground for Startup companies seeking their way to success. But, in this global world, ideas, inventions, education, philosophy, and art, generously link itself to all things technical, and you can engage in this \u201cthe future is now\u201d mentality with a sweep of a button.\n\nIf the future is here, we no longer need thinktanks to design the trajectory to where our reality is leading. Technology Hits harnesses a synergistic approach, unlike any other publication. Blockchains, Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation, Edge Computing, Quantum Computing, and Virtual and Augmented Reality are areas where the writers of Technology Hits can make a difference; amplifying ideas on our Quora interface or making a connection on our LinkedIn page.\n\nBut the scope does not end there. We are interested in digital art, philosophy, storytelling, technical insight, and all things technical that touch our everyday life.\n\nDigital art with permission to use by Jason Tait\n\nThere is so much to learn, and technology advances faster and faster. In the 19th century, there were 222,036 patents held, and by 2015, the Patent Office approved 9,646,948 patents! There are more patents than there are people on this earth, and you, my friend, may be the next future patent holder, too (How fast is Technology Accelerating?).\n\nInnovation\n\nIt starts with innovation: the limitless space where ideas ounce and move and sometimes hit, creating an explosion in science. The arena that Technology Hits offers is dynamic, fraught with ubiquity and conceptualizations waiting to be explored. This platform is made for you, the people that are changing the world.\n\nWe ask you to indulge in groundbreaking interpretations of what technology means to you.\n\nDigital art with permission to use by Jason Tait\n\nThe Extra Bonus\n\nThe creator of this new publication Dr. Mehmet Yildiz welcomes you to \u201c join my 100K+ mailing list, to collaborate, enhance your network, and receive technology newsletter reflecting my industry experience.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a contributor to Technology Hits, please send a request via this link.

        "title": "Stop Trying to Nail Down Your Best Publishing Days",
        "text": "Stop Trying to Nail Down Your Best Publishing Days\n\nIt\u2019s about more than the day of the week\n\nPhoto by @fabrikasimf \u2014 premium license via Freepik\n\nI\u2019m going against the grain here, but research speaks for itself. The idea writers should avoid self-publishing on the weekends could be costing you readers. So can trying to nail down the best time to submit to publications to ensure your story goes live at ideal times.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the stats of many writers, pointing out significant drops on the weekends. Yet, I regularly see better traffic on Sundays than Thursdays and Fridays. And on stories published just any old time.\n\nIn October 2020, my most significant spike on Medium happened on a Sunday. In almost every week this year, weekends were not the \u201cdead zone\u201d for views and reads.\n\nScreenshot by the author\n\nWhat affects readership\n\nMany issues affect readership and views, making it nearly impossible to compare apples to apples.\n\nCurrent events\n\nWhether it be politics, social media trends, or celebrity news, what\u2019s going on in the world can affect visits and reads, no matter the day.\n\nI published For the Love of Eddie Van Halen on the Thursday after he passed. Medium curated it that Sunday and readership spiked, resulting in one of my best reading days ever.\n\nParler has also been making recent headlines, which breathed new life into one of my early stories about the platform. It was published on a Sunday in June, and the article saw its largest spike on October 18th \u2014 a Sunday.\n\nThe day\u2019s headlines can help push stories to a trending status, but so can tomorrow\u2019s and next month\u2019s. No matter your audience, what\u2019s going on in the world will affect a story\u2019s traction.\n\nWhat your followers are doing\n\nWho makes up your target audience? People\u2019s professional life and interests determine when they spend time online and what they spend that time doing. A single mom may only have time to read late at night when the kids are in bed. A commuter who takes the train to work might be scanning stories an hour or two every weekday. A small business owner may only read on the weekends when the shop is closed.\n\nIf you have a niche following, you can better gauge when regular readers are most apt to be online, ready to absorb new information. For most writers, though, readers\u2019 habits are varied.\n\nWhat\u2019s popular on the platform\n\nAs I write this, the US is impatiently waiting for the final 2020 Presidential election results. Thus, politically-driven stories and social movements are prominent across most networks. After a time, this will shift to more post-election commentary until the ultra-popularity of political headlines fade and something else takes their place.\n\nHot content changes regularly, so it\u2019s tough to decide exactly when to publish any type of story. Just know that what shows in readers\u2019 feeds is based primarily on algorithms you have little control over.\n\nHow readers engage with the publication\n\nNot every publication is the same, and some have a good grasp on the best time to push things to their followers. Publication newsletters and spotlight posts can rejuvenate a writers\u2019 work on any given day.\n\nFocus on what to write, submit or publish next\n\nForget the days of the week. The beauty of publishing on writing/reading platforms is the ability to control how things are marketed. If data shows your best time to market on Facebook is 8am on a Tuesday, that\u2019s when you should hype your story or article. Best times will vary across social media networks, so your marketing schedule should be optimized per network, not per piece. This allows you to engage people the best way on each channel and gain more readers overall. And isn\u2019t that the real goal here? To introduce ourselves to as many authentic readers as possible?\n\nThere is no perfect launch time that works for everyone. Clicking the self-publish button merely triggers the algorithms. It does nothing to guarantee when all the traffic is going to flow in. So unless you have a massive loyal following of real readers, stop worrying so much about the days, and worry more about what you\u2019re going to share with the world next.",

        "title": "7 Inspiring Questions For A Personal Year-End Review",
        "text": "2021 is right around the corner and for most of us it can\u2019t come fast enough. We\u2019re ready to turn the page on 2020 and start afresh.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worthwhile to take a step back and put these past twelve months in perspective. At the end of each year, I do that by writing up a personal year-end review.\n\nThis exercise helps me set myself up for success in January. I reflect over what I achieved during the year, what obstacles I faced, and what lessons I learned. I try to think positively on the past year so I\u2019ll be motivated and inspired as the new one begins.\n\nThe insights I gain help me choose my goals for the new year. I\u2019m able to see what worked and what didn\u2019t so I can draw up a plan of action. As the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry once wrote, \u201cA goal without a plan is just a wish.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s blog post, I\u2019m sharing the seven questions from my annual review. Feel free to adapt them as you like \u2014 your answers can be a few sentences or several paragraphs long. It\u2019s entirely up to you.\n\nAnd you can still complete this annual review even if December has passed. I usually write it up the last week of December, but I\u2019ve also completed it at the beginning of January.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in:\n\n1. What were your plans/goals/dreams for 2020? Evaluate how they went.\n\nUnder this question, I list any New Year\u2019s resolution or other goals I made at the start of the year or throughout the year. Then I evaluate how they went.\n\nI chose the word \u201cevaluate\u201d because even if I didn\u2019t quite reach the goal I set at the beginning of the year, I might still have made significant progress and be able to check it off as a victory. Or perhaps my goals changed as the year progressed.\n\nSo even if you didn\u2019t reach a goal you\u2019d hoped to achieve, you can take a step back and evaluate why that happened. Maybe the goal was too overwhelming or too vague or you didn\u2019t prioritize it or there were circumstances outside your control that prevented you from achieving it. If you want to tackle the goal again in 2021, these observations will help you avoid making the same mistakes.\n\nConversely, if you did achieve your goals, you can evaluate what helped you to succeed so you can repeat that success with new goals in 2021.\n\n2. What new skills did you learn this year?\n\nI love jotting down any new skills I learned because it shows how I grew as a person in the past year. It\u2019s fascinating to think about how you can do something now that you couldn\u2019t in 2019.\n\nAs a writer, I love learning new skills as they help me widen the topics I can write about. I wrote an article here about the many different hobbies of famous writers.\n\nNew skills can be something that you learned in a matter of minutes or something that you dedicated several months to learning. It could be something you learned from a course (in person or online) or a YouTube video or a book or a friend or family member.\n\n3. What were several highlights of the year?\n\n2020 was a crazy and unpredictable year. For most of us, it was filled with disappointments and a rollercoaster of emotions. Some of us experienced the loss of loved ones. During times like this, I think it\u2019s more important than ever to stay positive.\n\nSo look back on the year for the big and little blessings. Were there any wonderful, unforgettable moments?\n\n4. What did you accomplish this year that you\u2019re most proud of?\n\nThis one is pretty self-explanatory. Take time to give yourself a pat on the back here.\n\n5. What (and/or who) are you most thankful for this year?\n\nIt\u2019s so important to practice gratitude at the end of the year. If you jot down a person under this question, you might even want to say your thank you directly to them with a phone call or a written note.\n\n6. What went well? What didn\u2019t go well?\n\nAfter writing down answers to all of the previous questions, I usually have a lot of thoughts swirling around in my head. So here I can spill those out on the page. I\u2019ll write a summary of overall how I think the year went: what strategies were effective at helping me achieve my goals, what prevented me, etc.\n\n7. What was the biggest lesson (or lessons) you learned this year?\n\nFinally, boil down into a sentence or two (or more if you\u2019d like) your biggest takeaway from the year and how that can help you going forward in 2021. As the Psalmist writes in Psalm 90, \u201cTeach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nI hope these questions help you as you draw up goals for the new year, and I also hope they help you reflect positively on the past year.\n\nBy the end of the year, we can forget a lot that happened. We might think that the year went terribly as we worked towards our goals. However, after writing up the annual review, we realize that we had many more successes than we originally remembered.\n\nI love the year-end review so much that I actually write up a month-in-review each month too. I share more about that in my blog post about the two journaling methods I use to boost my productivity.\n\nHappy New Year! I hope you have a fantastic 2021.",

        "title": "The Rise of the AI",
        "text": "Today Google finally released the long awaited AI powered messaging app Allo. This messaging app is powered by the amazing Google AI which is a competitor of Apple\u2019s Siri, Where Allo is prmarily text based and Siri is voice based. This app will also be competing with various other AI powered messaging apps such as the indian app Hike, China\u2019s WeChat, Facebook\u2019s M.\n\nSo being that much of a geek and nerd to know all of the above like the back of my hand, I had to have this app ASAP so as soon as me and my friends heard the news and the app went live on the Play Store in India we all had it.\n\nWe right away started testing out all the bells and whistles of the app, and one thing we all agreed on was damn the AI is good, because within 30 minutes of conversation in Hinglish (Hindi written with English Alphabets) between us and the AI had started predicting some of the basic stuff. And Damn we were impressed by that, because since forever we have been convinced that Hindi/Hinglish is a tough language to understand for an AI or a machine because of our experience with the AutoCorrect. The number of errors made by AutoCorrect in the US is not even close to the number it makes in India, and because of this we always end up either disabling it or set it to such a light mode that its nonexistent.\n\nSo for an AI to start predicting words for to say in Hinglish such as \u201cKYA?\u201d correctly we were impressed. So we then started exploring more features, and we started playing with the google AI. We asked all the silly questions, all the good questions, all the funny questions and the AI never disappointed us.\n\nBut during all this experimentation I realized something, the AI was predicting everything from what to say next to searching stuff that we wanted to discuss and stuff like that. For example I wanted to discuss about the girl in the movie Step Up, but obviously I did not remember her name, so my friend simply asked \u201c@google Step Up 2 cast\u201d and bam! google returned with the search results of this query. With the name of the girl. And then I wanted them to cross reference this information with a very old music video of theSong Numb by Linkin Park. Because today by chance saw that video and I was just shocked to see the same girl from Step Up 2 as the lead in the video. So the purpose of doing all this excercise was supposed to give my friends the shock and awe i experienced when i saw that girl in that old video which we all grew up listening to.\n\nBut since we were discussing all this on Allo my dear friend simply asked google for it, and she just gave up the same girl\u2019s name. So this event made me realize two things :\n\nHaving the google search at your fingertips can be a boon to your conversation or it can simply ruin the effect you want to create while talking. And second the ability to search everything from the Chat window itself will exponentially increase our dependency on google for everything. It is already being debated in various forums that google is making the upcoming generations dumb, because they have all the information they need at their fingertips. Now Google has done this literally.\n\nIn the above incident we did not use our memory banks at all, if we had simply tried to remember the video of Numb, we may not have gotten the answer quickly but eventually we would have remembered that the same girl worked in Step Up 2. But the AI simply made this act and experience redundant and pointless.\n\nSo by this post i am not trying to say AI is a bad thing, but rather i am simply trying to point out a side effect of such technology. Right now this side effect may seem minor but if we look at it in the long term this can be begining of Skynet!\n\nToday the AI just made our memory redundant, maybe in 20\u201330 years AI will be so sentient that it will feel that entire human race is redundant and pointless. But i hope by that time this happens we may also have developed technology to have emotions and most importantly a conscience. And then an even more ridiculous thing that i hope for is that we may be able to combine these two together. A sentient AI with emotions exactly like ours, kind of like the robot from iRobot.\n\nBecause this merger of two major technologies will be the only thing standing between SkyNet and a place where AI and Humans live in peace and harmony. I always hope for the second option.\n\nWhat do you think would the consequences of rise of the AI? Share your opinions in comments below. And if you enjoyed reading please recommend.",

        "text": "The Power of Habit\n\nWhy We Do What We Do In Life and Business\n\nThe Power of Habit, published in 2014, and just around 300 pages, combines historical examples, scientific discoveries, and common sense approaches to illustrate how anyone can make and break habits.\n\nThe Habit Loop\n\nAward winning reporter, Charles Duhigg shares useful case studies of people with extensive brain injuries to explain how and why your brain forms habits. Habits are your brain\u2019s way of conserving energy. The Habit Loop Model of Cue, Routine, Reward is the recipe your brain uses to create a habit out of any routine in order to be more efficient.\n\nThe science of habit forming has been applied to marketing products like Febreze and even coaching NFL teams.\n\nEven more interesting, the author retroactively applied The Habit Loop to the twelve-step AA program. It turns out those twelve steps developed over eighty years ago with no basis in science or therapeutic studies provide a powerful method for breaking alcohol addiction. While AA doesn\u2019t work for everyone, it has helped over ten million people achieve sobriety, lending creditably to its processes.\n\nBelief in The System\n\nOnce you have already picked up a bad habit and want to change it, according to The Power Habit, you can\u2019t simply eliminate the habit, as perhaps many people looking to quit smoking can attest. You must replace the routine with something else while keeping the cue and reward in place.\n\nOne of the more compelling examples in the book involves a woman hoping to stop the common problem of nail biting. Her therapy began by asking her to become more aware of when she felt compelled to chew. When she felt the urge, she was asked to keep count on an index card.\n\nOnce she became more aware of the impulse, she was then asked to swap out the habit of biting with something less destructive, like rapping her knuckles on a table or rubbing her arm. Every time she managed it successfully, she gave herself a checkmark on the index card where she was recording her habit. After a week, she had minimized her nail-biting to just a few times in total.\n\nLike anything in life, success is not possible without belief. Charles Duhigg makes his case for the power of believing with a football story about the Indianapolis Colts and Peyton Manning. Even highly disciplined sports superstars can benefit from good habit-forming.\n\nNot to spoil the story, but they go on to win the Super Bowl but not before they began to believe in the powerful forces at work behind forming good habits.\n\nUsing the Habit Loop and Understanding Habit Formation\n\nThe more a person comes to understand habit formation, the more success they\u2019ll experience at changing bad habits and adopting good ones. Whether you\u2019re looking to lose weight, stop smoking, exercise, or just be better organized, the Habit Loop provides a pathway.\n\nJust because it\u2019s incredibly straightforward doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy, however. The Power of Habit does a fabulous job breaking it down simply for you, but real work is up to you.",

You try the pomodoro method. You take that walk around the block, as suggested by everyone. No major improvements. You\u2019re not being as productive as you should, and you need to fix that\u2026 fast.\n\nSo you put on your headphones, pull up your favorite pop song or ambient rain mix and listen. Instantly, you can focus on those boring tasks on your to-do list (looking at you, email).\n\nAnd now you got one of them done. Then another. Now you\u2019re bobbing your head and in the zone.\n\nWhen nothing else seems to help make us productive, the right music can supercharge us. But in terms of our brain and work, what does music do and why does it help us?\n\nOver the next few newsletters, we will share why music affects our brains, explain how it boosts our thinking, and link up some of our favorite tunes that help us focus. We hope you enjoy!\n\n(Continue the conversation. Share your favorite jams by replying to this email or hitting us up on social @TheMissionHQ.) \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb6\n\nScience, Music, and Your Brain\n\nStudies about how music affects our brains and emotions have been ongoing since the 1950s, when physicians began to notice the benefits of music therapy in European and U.S. hospital patients. However, humans have been using music to communicate thoughts and feelings to one another for centuries.\n\nToday, research suggests that music can help relieve negative emotions like stress, anxiety, and depression. It can even decrease instances of confusion and delirium in elderly medical patients recovering from surgery. Furthermore, research says that listening to happy or sad music can make us perceive others as being happy or sad, respectively. All of these findings make it clear that, for better or worse, music\u2019s impact on our emotions is very real.\n\nIn terms of how music affects the brain, we can turn to a specific niche of research called neuromusicology, which explores how our nervous systems react to music. Basically, music enters the inner ear and engages many different areas of our brains, some of which are used for other cognitive functions, as well. (If you want to know the specifics of this detailed process, Dawn Kent explains it neatly in her thesis.)\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, the number of brain areas activated by music varies from person to person, depending on your musical training and your personal experiences with music. Therefore, how music impacts your ability to concentrate or feel a certain emotion can be expected to vary from person to person, too.\n\nHowever, there are some general brain and mood patterns that modern music research reveals, and these can help us decide what kinds of music to listen to at work. In tomorrow\u2019s letter, we will explain exactly what those are and share more of the science behind music. Stay tuned!",

And I\u2019ve found myself thinking some silly thoughts.\n\nThings like, \u201cif I get that work, my life will be made.\u201d\n\nAnd, \u201cThis is going to change the game for me, I\u2019m going to level up my happiness x100 if this happens.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\nThis kind of language is dangerously close to the absolutist if/then frame of happiness.\u200b\n\nHave you ever thought to yourself, if I could just get that promotion, I\u2019d finally be happy\u2026?\u200b\n\nOr maybe it wasn\u2019t about work or a promotion. Perhaps it was if only I could win that award, or buy that new house, or get married, or move to that country or lose ten kilos: Some specific goal or event you identified as the critical factor to feeling whole, fulfilled, happy.\n\nI\u2019d guess most people have had moments like this; where they lock onto an idea and convince themselves that that, that thing, holds the final number of the combination to unlock their happiness and bring total fulfilment for the rest of their lives.\u200b\n\nThe problem is, it rarely does.\n\nSure, the pay rise or award won or wedding or new car boosts happiness for a while. But eventually, when the novelty wears off, we go right back to the same level of happiness we felt before it. Then, there\u2019s a new \u2018big thing\u2019 we strive for, in hopes that it will fulfil us in the long term.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the case according to the theory known as the hedonic treadmill (or hedonic adaptation).",

        "text": "The 5 Most Common Types of Bias\n\nIf we approach the topic from a statistical point of view, there are five ways in which bias can creep into the results.\n\nConfirmation bias\n\nConfirmation bias is the inclination to look for, decipher, favor, and review data that affirms or bolsters one\u2019s earlier individual convictions or values. Therefore, confirmation bias is a powerful type of cognitive bias with a critical impact on society\u2019s correct workings by misshaping evidence-based decision-making.\n\nAn example of this is when you remember information selectively or make a biased interpretation of information given to you. Studies showed that we could even be manipulated to remember fake childhood memories. This indicates that people sometimes don\u2019t even notice when they analyze data in a biased way (another psychological phenomenon that fits this category is wishful thinking).\n\nSelection bias\n\nSelection bias is the bias introduced by selecting individuals, groups, or data for analysis that does not achieve proper randomization, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population to be analyzed. The term \u201cselection bias\u201d usually refers to a statistical analysis\u2019s bias resulting from the sampling method. Therefore, it is essential to consider selection bias. Some conclusions of the study may be wrong.\n\nOutliers\n\nAn outlier is an extreme data value. For example, a 110-year-old customer or a consumer with $10 million in their savings account. You can identify outliers by carefully inspecting the data, especially when distributing the values. Since outliners are extreme data values, it can be dangerous to decide based on the calculated \u201caverage.\u201d In other words, extreme behavior can have a significant impact on what is considered average. It is imperative to base your conclusions on the median (the average value) to have an accurate result.\n\nOverfitting and underfitting\n\nUnderfitting implies that a model gives an oversimplistic picture of reality. Overfitting is the inverse (i.e. an overcomplicated picture). Overfitting risks causing a particular assumption to be treated as the truth, whereas it is not the case in practice.\n\nHow can this bias be counteracted? The most straightforward approach is to ask how the model was validated. If you receive a somewhat glazed expression as a reaction, there is a good chance that the analysis outcomes are so-called unvalidated outcomes and, therefore, might not apply to the whole database. Always ask the data analyst whether they have done a training or test sample. If the answer is no, it is highly likely that the analysis outcomes will not be applicable to all customers.\n\nConfounding variables\n\nBasically, this happens when additional factors influence variables you have not accounted for. In an experiment, the independent variable usually affects your dependent variable. For example, if you want to investigate whether the need to exercise leads to weight loss, the need to work out is your independent variable and the weight loss is your dependent variable.\n\nDisturbing factors are all other factors that also influence your dependent variable. They are additional factors that have a hidden influence on your dependent variable. Aggravating factors can cause two main problems: increased variance and the introduction of bias.\n\nIt is essential to confirm that the conclusion drawn from research and analysis results is not affected by distortions. Uncovering biased results is not the sole responsibility of the analyst concerned. It is the joint responsibility of all those directly involved (including the market participant and the analyst) to reach a valid conclusion based on the correct data.",

        "text": "Why is the HBP Important?\n\nAccording to a report conducted by the World Heath Organization, it is estimated that 1 in 4 people will undergo some sort of mental or neurological disorder in their lives. That\u2019s almost 2 billion people. With the brain acting as the powerhouse to our body\u2019s decision-making and interpreter of our experiences, it becomes evident why neurological disorder is such a prominent problem facing society today.\n\nAs Henry Markram states, \u201c without decisions: we cannot see; we cannot think; [and] we cannot feel.\u201d He reasons that upon walking into a room, 99% of what you see does not actually come from the eyes; Rather, it is what you infer from the room upon which you are entering\u2014i.e., the layout of the room; the walls; the windows; how the furniture is arranged; how the floors meet the walls, etc. And it is this prevalence of decision-making throughout the human brain which is so important to our evolutionary kind, that it\u2019d be foolish to not dedicate time and energy into understanding and pinpointing the very fundamentals of what causes our own degradation, and \u2018sickness.\u2019\n\nThe increasing size of the neocortex across the evolution of primates is attributable to its fascinating success throughout this evolutionary process. It was so successful, in fact, that as brain matter continued to grow, primates eventually reached a point where they ran out of room in their skull for the brain to keep growing!\n\nAlarming change in brain size across human evolution (Source: The Acquatic Human Ancestor Theory)\n\nBut it didn\u2019t stop there. The brain continued growing, but now, folding in on itself, cramming every last bit of brain cells it can fit. Why? So it could store even more information and be able to perform even more complex functions.\n\nThat is, after all, the final product of evolution, according to Henry Markram, and it\u2019s why simulating the brain to perfection (purely from a pattern, circuitry-based perspective, as all brains are unique in composition) is the holy grail of neuroscience, as it will ultimately, physically(!) transform the way we think. Not only that, but it will allow us to perceive reality through another lens\u2014that is, a virtually realistic lens.\n\nWhat next?\n\nBy developing a virtually, realistic, working simulation, scientists may even be able to simulate a \u2018sick\u2019 computer\u2014i.e., a computer which is \u2018sick\u2019 with Parkinson\u2019s disease, or at least a disease similar in manner. In this way, it is believed that curing Parkinson\u2019s disease in this \u201csick,\u201d mathematically-computated-based simulation, we will be able to devise newer, creative ways of replicate this cure in real life.\n\nIn summary, by using a mathematically simulated model, which requires a computationally complex and able super-computer, we would be able to integrate a miniaturized model based on physiological data that describes the anatomy of, and activity of the brain in certain regions parts. This cataloging of specific cortical regions of the brain would ultimately allow us to understand the brain better, at least from a mathematical standpoint, which may allow us to better understand diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s, as well as how we may be able to cure it (i.e., with the help of brain-related medical treatments like Brain-Machine Interfaces.\n\nThis is the future of neuroscience.",

        "text": "A Simple Insight to Help Worriers Rein in Anxious Thoughts\n\nTeaching an anxious brain to picture happier scenes or scenarios helps against the inner dialogues that fuel daily anxieties\n\nThe most frightening movie monsters are the ones you never see. That\u2019s according to a 2020 study of horror films that appeared in the journal NeuroImage.\n\nFor that study, researchers in Finland scanned the brains of 37 people as they watched a lineup of scary movies that included The Exorcist, Insidious, and eight others. The study authors found that people were much more frightened by unseen or implied threats than by ones that actually appeared on screen.\n\nThat finding isn\u2019t too surprising: \u201cDon\u2019t show the monster\u201d is a timeworn rule in film and television horror, and the great terror writer H.P. Lovecraft famously said that \u201cthe oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\u201d The common wisdom here is that, left to its own devices, the human brain will usually come up with something more disturbing than anything a writer or director could dream up.\n\nAnd research on anxiety reveals that, much like that unseen movie monster, the most nagging and distressing concerns are typically ones we can\u2019t picture very clearly.\n\n\u201cWhen people worry, and particularly for those with generalized anxiety disorder, there tends to be a lack of mental imagery,\u201d says Colette Hirsch, PhD, a clinical psychologist at King\u2019s College London. Her research has found that rather than fire up the brain\u2019s projector screen, worry predominantly involves language-oriented parts of the brain. \u201cPeople tend to worry in words or sentences and at a more abstracted level,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s as though they\u2019re talking to themselves about possible negative outcomes.\u201d\n\nHirsch is quick to add that certain subtypes of anxiety, such as social anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, don\u2019t play by these rules. Both of those anxiety types tend to feature prolonged stretches of negative mental imagery.\n\nBut for most worriers, Hirsch says that words dominate. Teaching an anxious brain to picture happier scenes or scenarios may help people defang the inner dialogues that fuel their daily anxieties.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to worry in words or sentences and at a more abstracted level. It\u2019s as though they\u2019re talking to themselves about possible negative outcomes.\u201d\n\nWhy words flood the worried brain\n\nFor a forthcoming study in Current Directions in Psychological Science, researchers at the University of Arizona explored the neurological makeup of the human imagination, which includes the mind\u2019s ability to anticipate and fret about future hardships. Like Hirsch\u2019s research, the study finds evidence that worrying may tilt the brain away from vivid mental imagery and toward hazier, language-based patterns of activity.\n\n\u201cIndividuals who often worry or ruminate tend to get stuck in negative, repetitive forms of thought that involve focusing on one\u2019s feelings, problems, and symptoms,\u201d says Jessica Andrews-Hanna, PhD, first author of that study and director of the Neuroscience of Emotion and Thought Lab at the University of Arizona. \u201cGiven the repetitive and habitual nature of such thoughts, memories and future thoughts start to lose their detail and become overgeneralized.\u201d\n\nIn the study, Andrews-Hanna and her co-author Matthew Grilli divide the imagination and its associated brain networks into two systems, or \u201cstyles of thinking.\u201d The first, which she calls \u201cthe mind\u2019s eye,\u201d is an image-oriented style that involves \u201cthinking in a detailed and specific way\u201d about a memory or a hypothetical event. The second system, which Andrews-Hanna calls \u201cthe mind\u2019s mind,\u201d is a word-oriented system that tends to produce reflective and abstract thoughts and activates parts of the brain that deal with language.\n\nEveryone possesses and uses both of these systems, she says. But the word-oriented system seems to be dominant among people who frequently worry or ruminate.\n\nWhy does the worried brain seem to prioritize words over images? It may have something to do with the way an anxious mind turns inward.\n\n\u201cAnxiety is very interior-focused, whereas the exterior world is inherently imagery based,\u201d says Matthias Mehl, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Arizona. (Some of his work has found that people who talk a lot about themselves \u2014 which traditionally has been viewed as a sign of narcissism \u2014 is actually an indicator of distress and negative emotions.)\n\nMehl points out that mindfulness training \u2014 which according to research can reduce anxiety, depression, worry, and rumination \u2014 shifts a person\u2019s attention toward here-and-now sensory information and away from the self-directed and often verbal forms of inner dialogue.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re truly in the present and attendant to your sensory input, this is not verbal,\u201d he adds.\n\nPicturing a life without worry\n\nIf the language-oriented parts of the brain become overactive among worriers, image-based therapies might help turn down that overactivity. And Hirsch says she\u2019s now using these insights to inform her clinical work.\n\n\u201cI tell my clients that worry is like a magnet, and words seem to make that magnet more powerful.\u201d\n\nWhen someone is worrying, she says it can help if that person takes a moment to think of a happy or relaxed scene. For example, you could imagine yourself in one of your favorite places, or you could recall a happy experience in detail. \u201cIt won\u2019t last, but that kind of image might turn the volume down on your worrying,\u201d Hirsch says.\n\nThese suggestions are in line with a lot of existing research. For example, spending time each week recalling positive memories has been shown to reduce stress and interrupt negative thoughts and feelings. Also, guided-imagery therapy, during which a person is instructed to imagine a certain place or setting in great detail, can also reduce anxiety. For a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychology, people were guided through images of urban or nature settings. Both exercises led to significant reductions in anxiety, that study found.\n\n\u201cI tell my clients that worry is like a magnet, and words seem to make that magnet more powerful,\u201d Hirsch says.\n\nIt takes practice for habitual worriers to recognize when their mind has gotten stuck in a whirlpool of unhelpful words or self-talk. (Here again, mindfulness techniques can help.) But with time and training, people can escape from that whirlpool or avoid it in the first place. By activating different areas of the brain, pleasant mental imagery seems to help them do that.\n\n\u201cThese habits are hard to change, but you can change them,\u201d Hirsch adds.",

        "title": "How To Figure Out What Genre To Write In",
        "text": "What genre should you write in? Thriller books sell a lot of copies. So does science fiction, romance and even erotic fiction books.\n\nA few years ago, a book marketing expert told me self-published authors earn a good living writing in these genres.\n\nI wanted to earn a good living from writing books too.\n\nSo I spent a couple of months trying to write a thriller book that I could sell. I got up early every morning to work on it. And I hated it.\n\nThe process felt a lot more like work than anything enjoyable, and I couldn\u2019t get the story right, let alone finish it.\n\nI felt like I\u2019d never become an author.\n\n1. Are you writing the truth?\n\nRobert McKee is a screenwriting guru that film companies like Pixar call when they have problems with their scripts. He\u2019s also the author of the popular book every writer should read: Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting.\n\nA couple of years ago, he gave a storytelling conference in a hotel in Sligo, in the West of Ireland.\n\nAt the end of the conference, I got a chance to meet McKee. They say you should never meet your heroes, and I was a little nervous.\n\nI thanked him for his talk and then asked, \u201cHow does a writer figure out what to write about?\u201d\n\nSuffice to say, I didn\u2019t elaborate on my attempt to write lousy thrillers or erotic fiction.\n\nHe took a copy of Story from me and autographed the first page of it with this piece of advice,\n\n\u201cWrite the truth.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t think much about how to apply it for a couple of weeks until I started writing thrillers again.\n\n2. What books are in your library?\n\nOne morning, I got frustrated with the manuscript for my thriller and ripped it up. I was nowhere near the end.\n\nI turned around and looked at my bookshelf. My bookshelf was full of business books, biographies, memoirs, and books about creativity and even some self-help.\n\nI wasn\u2019t reading any thriller books or much science fiction or erotic fiction. And yet, for some reason, I was trying to write those types of stories. Instead of writing my personal truth, I was in it for the money.\n\nIt was no wonder I felt blocked and miserable.\n\nSo I started writing non-fiction about problems I had at work and in my business. I started writing personal essays about creativity, fitness and parenting. I found writing my form of the truth, like McKee advised, felt much easier and more enjoyable.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re feeling blocked or frustrated, consider what type of books fill your bookshelf or Kindle library.\n\nWriting what you love to read will help you find ideas for your next project.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, because you\u2019ve already read a lot of these books, you understand the conventions of the genre. So you know what readers expect.\n\n3. Are you mindful of your influences?\n\nConflicting advice alert!\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the middle of a creative project, be careful of reading too many contemporary books about a similar topic.\n\nWhat you read informs what you write.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t consciously set out to plagiarize, the ideas and stories you read will seep into your subconscious and will influence your work.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s best to approach a creative project with a blank slate.\n\nYour influences include books, music, television shows, people you talk to and blog or other writers you read or follow.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about inadvertently taking on a contemporary writer\u2019s voice, consider cultivating older influences. Instead of reading something new, review the bestseller lists from 50 or 60 years ago, or classics out of copyright.\n\nYou may find an interesting idea or angle for your book or story that other contemporary writers have forgotten.\n\nOn the other hand, if you spent a lot of time reading books that were published today or yesterday, you\u2019re more likely to regurgitate somebody else\u2019s ideas.\n\nDeciding what to write about is a big question for every writer.\n\nSure, you can write to market and knock out a thriller, romance or science-fiction book. But the happiest writers focus on revealing a personal truth. It\u2019s hard and worthwhile work.\n\nSo, what\u2019s your truth?",

        "title": "How The COVID-19 Pandemic Sets The Stage For Corrupted Citizen Control",
        "text": "How can all that happen?\n\nThe crux of the movie Now You See Me 2 revolved around a chip that the elite could use to manipulate stock markets, governments and the general populations, and its ending scene is as shown in the Youtube clip below:\n\nEnding scene for Now You See Me 2\n\nWhile we don\u2019t see it occurring so blatantly to us yet, the possibility of the ruling elites being able to one day wield their powers and subjugate the general populace is downright scary.\n\nIdeas are circulating about that it might be better to have a \u201cCOVID-19 vaccine passport\u201d, as it has been reported on Yahoo:\n\nAustralians who want to travel overseas will likely require some sort of \u2018passport\u2019 to confirm they\u2019ve received the Covid-19 vaccine, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce has revealed. \u201cWhat we are looking at is how you can have a vaccination passport, an electronic version of it, that certifies what the vaccine is, is it acceptable to the country you are travelling to,\u201d Joyce told Nine. Joyce said creating the document would be tough, but likely key to ensuring safe travel. \u201cWe are looking at changing the terms and conditions to say for international travellers that we will ask people to have the vaccination before they get on the aircraft,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cBut certainly for international visitors coming out and people leaving the country (Australia), we think that\u2019s a necessity.\u201d Labor frontbencher Bill Shorten expressed support for the proposal, saying Australians would likely want to know whether the passengers they are seated next to were vaccinated. \u201cI would expect anyone coming into Australia is going to have to demonstrate to us that they are COVID safe,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the one hand, yes we do need to ensure safety and halt the spread of the virus.\n\nBut on the other hand, are such control measures necessary, especially when there is no conclusive proof that this highly infectious virus is causing significant death and destruction.\n\nRather, there is significant proof from this pandemic that:\n\nPeople with dysregulated autophagy mechanisms, such as those who are experiencing obesity, type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or heart disease are at higher risk of death from an infection. People are experiencing higher levels of stress and insecurity as the entire global economy suffers. Jobs are lost, livelihoods are affected \u2014 the fallout can also take a significant toll on one\u2019s psychological health. A misrepresentation of the death toll from COVID-based infections can skew public perceptives towards obtaining a vaccine or a drug, which plays right into the hands of Big Pharma. Lest we forget, the drug Tamiflu was once upon a time stockpiled for a flu pandemic, only for various criticisms to emerge about the efficacy of the drug\u2026 but by then, Roche had already pocketed \u00a3473 million from the British government. In the same vein, Pfizer\u2019s stock rose when it announced that its vaccine showed promising results, and Pfizer\u2019s CEO managed to sell one ton of stock on the same day. Would have been a cool profit. Coincidence, or well-timed? But yet there are already reports of severe allergic reactions to the vaccine from unknown causes.\n\nI\u2019m always an advocate of supporting one\u2019s immune system, which is the most crucial piece in the body\u2019s infectious defences. But yet most people still do not understand how a virus can infect a cell, as well as how the immune system recognises the infection and proceeds to dispose of the viral threats.\n\nAs long as we don\u2019t know how to support immune functions against viral threats from the scientific perspective, we can do all we want in terms of social lockdowns and symptom-alleviating drugs\u2026\n\nBut will that be enough, you reckon?\n\nAt the very least, let\u2019s aim to figure out how our immune system works on virus elimination from our body, no?",

        "title": "I Survived Toxic Startup, Here\u2019s the Antidote",
        "text": "I usually talk in very glowing terms about startup life. Sometimes I forget that it can suck.\n\nI\u2019m lucky because, in over 20 years of this entrepreneurial insanity, it\u2019s been rare that I\u2019ve gotten screwed over or been forced to make decisions that I might regret later. But make no mistake, I have indeed ended up with the short end of the deal more than once. I\u2019ve been betrayed both personally and professionally. I\u2019ve had to make painful decisions that \u2014 while I don\u2019t regret them \u2014 I sure didn\u2019t want to make at the time.\n\nWe tend to push the startup mythology as a utopian meritocracy where the best ideas always win \u2014 ideas that are executed by anti-heroes with minds that are wired to see the future in a way that you and I can\u2019t. We paint these visionaries as magnets of money and talent. Then we have them falling into billion-dollar valuations because they deserve it.\n\nThe truth isn\u2019t anything like this mythology, but it\u2019s just as strange.\n\nTruth is about as strange as fiction\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley was especially popular with people in the startup game. It\u2019s because they nailed all the flaws. It\u2019s well known that Mike Judge hired a number of valley players as consultants, and those consultants hit almost every sour note perfectly.\n\nIn fact, a lot of what happened on the show happened to me almost in real time. Silicon Valley began airing right after I sold one of my startups, and they aired seasons 1\u20133 while my other startup went into our Series B raise and then through an acquisition by a private-equity firm.\n\nAlmost went broke? Check. Right before our Series A hit our bank account, we were one week short of missing payroll.\n\nYou can take less? We did. We took about half of our highest investment offer at half the valuation.\n\nCopycats? They were everywhere, including one that lifted every pixel of our website except for our name and another who listed me as their CEO.\n\nPatent trolls? You bet we got hit. I\u2019m not at liberty to talk about how it ended.\n\nIntellectual espionage? Yeah, there was more than one company that tried to steal our IP under a ruse, including one who tried to get me to drop trade secrets during an \u201cinterview\u201d for an overseas tech magazine.\n\nStartup is not utopia, but it\u2019s not dystopia either\n\nStarting a company is no ticket out of the real and ruthless business world. There\u2019s no escaping malfeasance, manipulation and straight up evil. And when you\u2019re on your own and you\u2019re small, with no one to back you up, all of that evil can fester inside you real quick if you let it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll wind up succumbing to it and becoming exactly what you were railing against when you went out on your own in the first place.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do that. Yes, startups can be toxic, but there are antidotes.\n\nNever do anything just for the money\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019re going to be tempted by deals, customers and investment that will put a shitload of cash in your coffers for the wrong reasons. You can say you\u2019ll never do that, or you can say of course you\u2019d do that. Either way, when the time comes, just know that taking money for money\u2019s sake \u2014 whether it\u2019s a customer you\u2019re not ready for or an investor who wants you to be something you\u2019re not \u2014 is one step further away from your mission. It\u2019s one step closer to toxicity.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s a giant step.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how a cool and forward-thinking startup lost its way, it probably happened when the leaders justified a deal they shouldn\u2019t have made because they couldn\u2019t say no to the money.\n\nI\u2019m not a fool. I know money is the fuel that powers the rocket. But as backwards as this sounds, it\u2019s true: I know many more entrepreneurs who regret taking money than entrepreneurs who regret not taking the money.\n\nThere is no such thing as a sweetheart deal\n\nAlong those same lines, there is never a deal that allows a startup to go from a little to a lot overnight without some massive compromise. I\u2019m not here to be your ethical compass, but I will tell you that the startup game is rife with get-rich-quick schemes.\n\nThe worst of these are the startup-in-a-box models \u2014 step-by-step, surefire plans to make you rich with the added bonus of being your own boss. Sometimes it\u2019s multi-level-marketing, sometimes it\u2019s drop shipping, sometimes it\u2019s a digital currency. Those former Ponzi schemers and charlatans lean on the utopian haze of startup life to add glitz to the kind of scam that\u2019s been going on since the dawn of the last century.\n\nBelieve me when I tell you that any entrepreneur who has found the can\u2019t-miss strategy for making money would be scaling that strategy completely on his or her own. There\u2019s no need to cut a middleman into the deal.\n\nSet your expectations correctly\n\nThe vast majority of startups fail. Sometimes they fail early, before the idea even gets off the ground. Sometimes they fail late, when all the mass-market assumptions turned out to be susceptible to a fatal flaw that everyone ignored.\n\nBe prepared for a lot of failure. It comes with the job.\n\nAlso, a very, very small percentage of entrepreneurs get to f-you money. I don\u2019t have f-you money. But here\u2019s my dark secret. I don\u2019t want f-you money. Never did.\n\nI\u2019ll spare you the cautionary tales and morality plays, but more money really does come with more problems. Some of us get to see that early, some don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to believe me, but as I\u2019ve ridden this roller coaster over and over again, I\u2019ve met very few people with both f-you money and happiness.\n\nJust make sure you want what you\u2019re asking for, because you\u2019ll probably get it.\n\nTrust, but verify\n\nThis is an old adage, but I\u2019m shocked at how often it\u2019s ignored, especially when I\u2019m the one ignoring it. You don\u2019t have to live your life in bubble wrap, but whenever money leaves your hands, you should have a clear indication of where it\u2019s going to end up and a signal back to you when it gets there.\n\nThis includes purchases, partnerships, salaries, and especially any time you hand authority over to someone else for something that\u2019s very valuable to your company.\n\nAgain, you don\u2019t have to be cynical about every action. If you put an NDA in front of an investor before you pitch, that investor is going to show you the door. But before you sign the term sheet to take that investor\u2019s money, you should be doing the same amount of due diligence on them as they are doing on you.\n\nYour currency is appreciation\n\nAll of these admittedly simple scenarios distill down to one that isn\u2019t really talked about much.\n\nYou start a company to solve old problems in new ways. You start a company because the way the old regime does things irritates you. You start a company to help people.\n\nYou don\u2019t start a company to buy a boat.\n\nIt\u2019s probably easier to reach a certain level of financial and social success by being a role player at an established company and following rules and standards that were established years ago, maybe even years before you were born.\n\nBut, in a startup, every time a customer says thank you, every time you make a customer\u2019s life a little better, every time a customer\u2019s eyes light up because they see their old problems in a new light, that\u2019s your reward. You made that happen. That\u2019s your currency.\n\nAnd therein lies the antidote. If you perpetually prioritize your customers, your employees, and your community, your startup life will remain non-toxic, maybe even utopian.\n\nHey!

        "title": "7 Things I Gave up to Pursue My Entrepreneurial Endeavors",
        "text": "1. S E C U R I T Y\n\nWhen you are working a traditional job, it is easy to forget that you generally have some sense of security. As soon as you commit to pursuing entrepreneurial projects instead of maintaining traditional employment this becomes abundantly clear in many ways:\n\nMargin for Error \u2014 Most companies have some built in margin of error that they allow employees before firing them. At a minimum, it is likely cost prohibitive at most companies to arbitrarily fire employees. As an entrepreneur you are constantly faced with small decisions, any of which can derail your project or business.\n\n\u2014 Most companies have some built in margin of error that they allow employees before firing them. At a minimum, it is likely cost prohibitive at most companies to arbitrarily fire employees. As an entrepreneur you are constantly faced with small decisions, any of which can derail your project or business. Healthcare \u2014 One of the most effective forms of \u201cGolden Handcuffs\u201d that American employer have is healthcare. It may not be a great plan, but navigating the healthcare market as an entrepreneur can be distressing and time consuming. If you have a chronic condition, as 60 percent of Americans do, this is a major concern. If you have family relying upon your traditional job for benefits, the potential risk is extraordinarily high.\n\n\u2014 One of the most effective forms of \u201cGolden Handcuffs\u201d that American employer have is healthcare.

If you have a chronic condition, as 60 percent of Americans do, this is a major concern. If you have family relying upon your traditional job for benefits, the potential risk is extraordinarily high. Retirement \u2014 Entrepreneurs need to consider what\u2019s going to happen after they retire. A common problem with entrepreneurs is that they are so focused on the present and creating a business, that they neglect planning for retirement. Planning for retirement is harder for entrepreneurs because of the irregularity of their incomes and less options than many working traditional salaried jobs.\n\n2. R E L A T I O N S H I P S\n\nPhoto by Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash\n\nEntrepreneurs do not need to sacrifice all relationships for the sake of their own personal success, but having a job with irregular hours, high personal accountability, and sporadic bursts of stress makes it difficult to keep up with friends and family.\n\nIt is even worse when it comes to dating. In my experience, anything that deviates from the societal norm (working a traditional job) may be initially seen as exciting by a potential partner but it is quickly viewed as a personality flaw. It is very hard for someone working a traditional job to understand the pressure and effort required to keep an entrepreneurial venture alive.\n\n3. C O M P L A C E N C Y\n\nPhoto by Drew Coffman on Unsplash\n\nComplacency is generally viewed as a negative trait but it is also a luxury that most entrepreneurs will not experience.\n\nCreating a new business or entrepreneurial venture is hard. Keeping it afloat while competing with larger businesses or well funded individuals is even harder.\n\nThis typically involves constant attention to detail, strategizing, adapting, and having a clear understanding of market realities.\n\nNone of this lends itself to complacency, which allows you to coast by by putting in \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cacceptable\u201d levels of effort.\n\n4. R O U T I N E S\n\nPhoto by insung yoon on Unsplash\n\nWhile many writers/growth hackers swear by the benefits of routines (i.e. get up at 5 a.m. every day or do these 5 things before lunch), my experience has been that being an entrepreneur requires you to let go of routines.\n\nThat is not to say you won\u2019t form new routines. You almost certainly will.\n\nBut most routines are difficult to maintain.\n\nI would say that flexibility and adaptability are far more important to most entrepreneurs.\n\nYour schedule is constantly in flux, you have unexpected opportunities come up which demand a disproportionate amount of time and focus, and you are typically filling multiple roles for your business.\n\n5. V A C A T I O N S\n\nPhoto by Simon Migaj on Unsplash\n\nEntrepreneurs are obviously allowed to take vacations.\n\nAfter all \u2014 isn\u2019t that sort of flexibility one of the benefits?\n\nYes and no.\n\nIf you are the sole entrepreneur working on a project, it is hard willingly allow your businesses growth to suffer. Even if you are overworked and desperately need a vacation.\n\nEven if you do manage to take a vacation, it will almost certainly be a working vacation.\n\nI actually prefer to work everyday, regardless of what day of the week it is or where I am, 365 days per year if that means I get to pursue projects I am passionate about.\n\nBut this lifestyle is certainly not for everyone, and it may lead to problems as the majority of the world is not operating under the same assumption.\n\n6. S T A B I L I T Y\n\nPhoto by NeONBRAND on Unsplash\n\nFinancial stability is amazing and is definitely something I can appreciate.\n\nBut a major shift for me, as someone who loves personal finance, is learning to live without financial stability.\n\nThe level of financial risk varies depending on your financial resources, living situation, and the cost of your idea.\n\nThat is why many entrepreneurs start off with a \u201cside hustle\u201d which is a good way to test an idea without quitting your primary job.\n\nBut regardless of how prepared you feel, there is always an element of uncertainty.\n\n7. T R O P H I E S\n\nPhoto by Sung Jin Cho on Unsplash\n\nThere are almost no external rewards for being an entrepreneur until you have had major financial success. And this can literally take decades.\n\nA traditional job offers you a steady stream of titles and clear promotions, which is much easier to internalize as being successful.\n\nThis can be disheartening sometimes, but it makes those rare moments of success all the more worthwhile.\n\nI also think this form of delayed gratification is a true gift in a world where most people are looking for a quick dopamine fix, whether it\u2019s through a like on social media, or a literal award for a job well done.",

        "title": "The Winning Ad \u2014 Lessons In Book Promotion",
        "text": "Version A (thank you, Vico Biscotti, for your review used as copy for this ad)\n\nI\u2019m deep into book promotion. I recently started to create the first ads for the How to Self-Publish Your Book: The Fast, Free & Easy Way promotion campaign. The one above seems to be the winning one in the A/B test. It proves that less is more and that what counts are the reviews and price.\n\nHere is the B version. It\u2019s not exactly tanking, but it doesn\u2019t produce nearly as good results.\n\nVersion B\n\nAs a writer who not that long ago started her self-publishing career, I feel that book promotion is one of the most treacherous and confusing aspects of self-publishing. The number of misleading information and book promotion businesses bordering on scam is astonishing.\n\nWriters get easily swindled out of money on the sites that do not bring any sales but take their money nevertheless, and then, if one dares to complain, they will blame it all on the writer, the book cover, or whatever else but themselves and their poor service.\n\nThe truth is, some sites will bring sales to the same author promoting the very same book, while others won\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple. Unfortunately, separating the wheat from the chaff is not simple at all and there is no other way but to try it out and test the options.\n\nBy doing this, I\u2019ve already wasted a lot of money on useless promo services and that\u2019s one of the main reasons why I\u2019m writing my next book in the self-publishing series. It\u2019s called You Self-Published, Now What? How to Promote Your Book.\n\nThe book will help writers avoid unnecessary losses I and too many others have endured and show you how to make the best out of what little funds you have, which is exactly what I\u2019m doing. The ad above is doing well on BookBub promotion platform and I\u2019m happy with how that is working out.\n\nThat, for instance, is one of the options I can recommend and will write more about in the new book. Like my previous book (How to Self Publish Your Book: The Fast, Free & Easy Way), the new one will also come in the form of a 101 guide for beginners and I will keep it at the lowest price point so that it will be affordable to all.\n\nAs a result, I\u2019m not earning much and am currently facing a loss due to the investment in promotion. On the other hand, though, the book has stayed in the top 10 in two categories on Amazon for three months in a row now, which means that Amazon algorithm is recognizing it as something worth supporting and is helping me promote it.\n\nI\u2019m going to earn a bit over $70 this month on Medium and I will (yet again) invest it all in the book promotion. While this will allow me to continue with testing and experiments that are vital for a better understanding of what is worth the investment and what isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not quite enough.\n\nI\u2019m currently conducting the research and collecting the links to useful resources and information as well as monitoring the results, costs, and sales resulting from my marketing campaign. I\u2019m also testing different ads and copy. Like with the previous book, I will soon start publishing my findings in a form of blog posts prior to launching the book.",

        "title": "Design principle: Aesthetics",
        "text": "Now that we know a bit more about aesthetic design, let\u2019s look at why it matters.\n\nWhy aesthetic design matters?\n\nNot long ago user were expecting only functional and usable products when they were buying. Today, users expectations have evolved together with the design field.\n\nPeople expect usability by default and are seeking products that are more than functional and usable. We want to experience pleasure, to stimulate our senses. We want the products we use to evoke positive emotion in us. Aesthetic design is crucial to satisfy these needs.\n\nWe all judge the book by its cover. The better the book cover the more we believe the content is better. This is phenomenon called \u201cAesthetic-usability\u201d. Beautiful products/objects are perceived as easier to use and more valuable than ugly ones. Even if it is not true!\n\nThis phenomenon is especially valid when the products compared are equal in functionality and ease of use. The better looking product will win over the users swiftly.\n\nAesthetically pleasing designs are bringing up positive attitude in the users. It makes them care more about the product. Aesthetic design makes people more loyal of the brand and tolerant toward mistakes or failures. Imagine all the apple fans.\n\nEarly impressions of a product design matter! Aesthetic design is influencing how people think and feel. It influences how much pleasure we feel from the product. Aesthetic design affects our long-term attitude about products and even people.\n\nAesthetic design matters not only to make the first impression, but also to keep strengthening the bond with the user. The design of our products needs to be aesthetically pleasing consistently across the whole product and user journey.\n\nDesign for aesthetic pleasure\n\nLet\u2019s see how the words above can be useful for us to make better design. We have to design products that deliver pleasure to the user with aesthetics and usability.\n\nBut when aesthetics are in the senses of our users, how do we know what to design? The answer can be given by the people we\u2019re designing the product/experience for. We need to understand them before deciding what is aesthetically pleasing.\n\nWhen we are designing products for really wide audience it is wiser to keep things simple as much as possible!\n\nThere are 4 important pleasure aspect that we need to consider when we want to make our designs aesthetically pleasing.\n\nPsychical pleasure\n\nPleasure derived mostly from touch, smell and taste. Think of designing hand-held product, computer devices, VR set even a normal pen.\n\nWe need to make sure the design is ergonomic, it feels comfortable and doesn\u2019t overload the user senses. Consider how sensitive are your user\u2019s senses, what is the average norm. Make sure the smell and taste is either neutral or brings positive associations.\n\nSocial pleasure\n\nPleasure derived from interacting with other people or with AI(still not that common). This context is very broad it can be from home assistant device and VR experiences to a room/building where social events will be hosted.\n\nWe need to make sure the design supports social interaction in the best way possible. It could be as simple as the sound aesthetics of the coffee machine that allows employees to communicate, while waiting for the coffee to be ready.\n\nPsychological pleasure\n\nPleasure derived from completing a task or feeling in control and safe. This context is very tightly related to the usability of the product. But it can be also related to how the product design looks.\n\nFor example, a solid and stable looking car gives more psychological comfort than one that seems it might break if you open the door. Same is valid for digital products where the user feels in control and knows the task can be completed for sure.\n\nMaking things look and feel simple and stable. Guiding the user with great composition and motion. Using aesthetics plays a big role in making the users feel safe and in control.\n\nIdeological pleasure\n\nThis context is mostly about abstract pleasure. I like to think of it as the glue that binds the other pleasure types. It is the meaning of the words in the books not the colors, font sizes and page layouts.\n\nFor example, in product design taking the sustainability angle can trigger pleasure in the user, making her feel well because she is responsible for the environment. Here are a 5 startups that are using that context.\n\nWe need to make sure that our designs communicate ideas and deeper meaning. This can frequently result in very deep aesthetically pleasure once the user realizes it.\n\nBalancing aesthetics and usability\n\nThere are cases where we need to sacrifice aesthetics, due to different limitations depending on the context. Other times aesthetics could dominate the usability aspect.\n\nAesthetics and usability in balance\n\nThis is what most of the cases as Designers we should strive to achieve in our designs. There are many good examples from smart phones and apps to computer chairs that look and feel good, but also have the desired usability.\n\nAesthetics over usability\n\nSome times products have dominating aesthetics that are not supported by good usability and ergonomics. This is mostly visible in the fashion industry.\n\nI guess these might be nice in winter time :)\n\nShoes made to look nice and attractive, while at the same time destroying the feet of the user. This demonstrates clearly how humans can be seduced by aesthetic design and even at the price of their health.\n\nUsability over aesthetics\n\nOther times usability must be on focus no matter what. Equipment designed for emergency situations, where people cognition is compromised. In this cases aesthetics are with low priority. When designing for such cases there are a lot of constraints from different authorities and requirements. Using Hick\u2019s law for quick decision making can help you make the better design decisions.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nFirst impression matters. When we perceive beauty with more of our senses we feel deeper pleasure from the design. Aesthetic design gives users pleasure from the start! It makes them form a bond with the design, bond that goes beyond the initial interaction.\n\nAesthetic design is perceived as more friendly, usable and valuable.\n\nCall to action\n\nIf you found this article useful tap the \ud83d\udc9a so others can enjoy it, too.\n\nThanks for your time!

        "text": "By John Stanton \u2022 May 20, 2019\n\nPrivacy is indeed a major concern for Americans and should not be the preserve of the wealthy.

        "title": "How to build the perfect Deep Learning Computer and save thousands of dollars",
        "text": "Updated 12/11/2019\n\nBuilding your own Deep Learning Computer only takes a few hours. Assembly video is below.\n\nPicking the 4 most important parts: CPU, GPU, Storage and Memory.\n\nThere are only 8 components to a build: GPU, CPU, Storage, Memory, CPU Cooler, Motherboard, Power, Case. The first 4 are the most important. When training, data flows from storage to memory to the GPU, while the CPU helps along the way (manipulates batches, etc). So, you want to make sure:\n\nYour CPU can support all your GPUs\n\nYour GPU is fast enough and can fit the model and data batch in memory\n\nMemory is DDR4 and big enough to float most datasets uncompressed\n\nStorage is M.2 PCIe and big enough\n\nMake your computer expandable to 4 GPUs with the right CPU\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how many GPUs you\u2019ll need because some models take 10s of hours to train (Vision CNNs, Natural Language Processing LSTMs, Capsule Auto Encoders, etc). So, one of the best ideas is to start with 1 or 2 GPUs and add more GPUs as you go along.\n\nEach GPU requires at least 8x PCIe lanes (it\u2019s 16x officially, but there\u2019s data for which 8x is good enough if you\u2019re not running cross-GPU experiments). You will need 4x PCIe lanes for the M.2 SSD (which plugs right in and is 5x faster than SATA3), and another 4x PCIe lanes for Gigabit ethernet. That\u2019s a total of 40 PCIe lanes and will restrict your CPU choices quite a bit. Your CPU will dictate the motherboard you need. (For example: AMD Threadripper CPU = X399 chipset motherboard, Intel 7900X CPU = X299 chipset motherboard, etc).\n\nYou\u2019ll want a CPU with 8+ cores / 16+ threads and 40+ PCIe lanes since this allows 4 experiments per GPU (16 experiments if you have 4 GPUs). Typically models take up at least a couple gigabytes of GPU memory so it\u2019s rare you can run more than 4 experiments per GPU. Finally, make sure the PCIe lanes are actually getting routed to the expansion slots.\n\nAMD CPUs offer better value than Intel\n\nAs of December 2019, AMD offers more performance for less money. AMD\u2019s 1920X with 12 Cores/24 Threads/60 PCIe lanes is only $199! Intel\u2019s 7900X with 10 Cores/20 Threads/44 PCIe lanes is $1000. Benchmarks show comparable performance, so AMD seems like a no-brainer. AMD\u2019s second generation 2920x is only $400. (Disclosure: I\u2019m long AMD stock.)\n\nYour GPU needs to have enough memory and be fast enough\n\nGPU memory works differently than computer RAM, so if you don\u2019t have enough memory to fit your model you won\u2019t be able to train (as opposed to train slowly). Once in a while I have a model that requires 10GB+ to run, so if in doubt, choose one with more memory.\n\nNvidia GPUs are easier to use than other platforms because they have the most community support for tools (Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc). Buy cards that have \u2018blower style\u2019 fans instead of the large double fans because if you have multiple GPUs you need to vent air outside of the box. (eg 1080 Ti Founder Edition, or 2080 Ti Asus Turbo)\n\nYour choices are basically:\n\nSuper High-end: Titan RTX (24GB / 4608 Cores / 576 Tensor Cores / $2,500) You can only fit one of these on the bottom slot because Titans don\u2019t use blower fans.\n\nTitan RTX (24GB / 4608 Cores / 576 Tensor Cores / $2,500) You can only fit one of these on the bottom slot because Titans don\u2019t use blower fans. High-end : 2080 Ti (11GB / 4352 Cores / 544 Tensor Cores /$1149), 1080 Ti (11GB / 3584 Cores / $500 used), 2080 Super (8GB / 3072 Cores / 384 Tensor Cores / $730)\n\n: 2080 Ti (11GB / 4352 Cores / 544 Tensor Cores /$1149), 1080 Ti (11GB / 3584 Cores / $500 used), 2080 Super (8GB / 3072 Cores / 384 Tensor Cores / $730) Mid-tier : 2070 Super (8GB / 2560 Cores / 320 Tensor Cores / $530)\n\n: 2070 Super (8GB / 2560 Cores / 320 Tensor Cores / $530) Low-end (Best Value) : 2060 Super (8GB / 2176 Cores / 272 Tensor Cores / $410)\n\n: 2060 Super (8GB / 2176 Cores / 272 Tensor Cores / $410) GPU inventory is very limited, so you may have to hunt around for inventory\n\nThe Titan RTX is a monster card and ~55% faster than 1080 Ti on 32 bit training and 135% faster in half precision mode because of the additional Tensor Cores and extra memory which allows for much larger batch sizes. 2080 Ti is ~40% faster than 1080 Ti on 32 bit training and ~65% faster when used in half precision mode. From there, speed performance is linear to the number of CUDA cores so expect 1080 Ti to be ~40% faster than 1080 and 1080 to be 33% faster than 1070.\n\nStorage and Memory need to be as fast as possible\n\nBecause you\u2019ll be moving lots of data around from storage to memory then to the GPUs, you want that pipeline to be as fast as possible. Use M.2 SSD NVMe, which plugs right into the motherboard and DDR4 memory.\n\nImportant tradeoffs of my build and common pitfalls\n\nInitial single-GPU build costs $3k and can expand to 4 GPUs later\n\nHere is my parts list with updated pricing and inventory.\n\nGPU: I picked the 1080 Ti intially because a 40% speed gain versus 1080 is significant when you\u2019re talking about 10-hour train times, and the extra 3GB of memory is important when working with large models or increasing training speed with larger batch sizes. 1080 Tis are hard to find now, so check eBay. I later added a 2080 Ti and a Titan RTX in the bottom slot. As of 2020, the 2060 Super is the best value for a starter card.\n\nCPU: AMD\u2019s 1920X has 12 cores and 38MB cache and is $150 more expensive vs. 1900X\u2019s 8 cores and 20 MB cache. Earmarking 2 cores / 4 threads per GPU and the fact I might want the machine to double as a staging server later, 1920X gives me a little more breathing room.\n\nStorage: I used a single 1TB M.2 SSD, I don\u2019t like having stuff on different drives and 500GB seems small considering datasets are often tens of gigabytes. I might add a super large spinning hard drive for \u2018cold\u2019 storage later.\n\nMemory: Quad channel memory is used because 1920X runs faster with quad than dual channel memory. 4 x 16GB is chosen because maximum supported memory is 128GB so it\u2019s an easy upgrade path without needing to remove chips later. 3000Mhz is the fastest memory compatible with the motherboard (it\u2019s overclocked from base 2667Mhz).\n\nPower Supply: 1600W P2 is enough to cover 4x250W GPUs + 180W CPU + 150W for everything else and a little bit of headroom for overclocking. You don\u2019t want to max out your power supply because fans kick in like crazy when it\u2019s running at high utilization.\n\nCase: Lian-Li PC-O11AIR because I need a case with 8 expansion slots (most mid-tower cases have 7, which means you cannot fit 4 double-wide GPUs). Between this case and the Corsair Air, this case looks nicer and comes with dust filters.\n\nAvoid these 7 Common Pitfalls\n\nRun through this list to make sure your build checks out.\n\nGPUs overheat my computer: Make sure you get the blower-style GPUs (The 2080 Ti version is called Turbo by Asus) because they vent out the back of the case. The \u2018Overclock\u2019 \u2018OC\u2019 type cards will have 2 large fans that blow into the computer, which will overheat. You also need a fan that delivers cold air directly onto the GPUs\u2019 intake. You can fit one Titan RTX in the bottom slot if your case has a vent on the bottom like the O11AIR . Not enough PCIe lanes: You need at least 8x PCIe lanes / GPU (16x is better). If you have 4 GPUs, with a M.2 drive and Gigabyte ethernet, it\u2019s 40 PCIe lanes at a minimum. My model doesn\u2019t fit in my GPU memory: large Convolutional Networks and LSTMs use a lot of GPU memory, 8GB vs. 11GB is a big difference. Motherboard doesn\u2019t fit 4 GPUs: Your motherboard needs to have slots for up to 4 GPUs and they must have space between them to use all 4. Best way is to check is a visual inspection on Google Images or search for people who have done it. Case doesn\u2019t fit 4 GPUs: most mid tower-cases only have 7 expansion slots, so you will not be able to put a 4th double-wide GPU in the bottom slot. I\u2019ve only found Lian Li and Corsair as options. Power Supply doesn\u2019t have enough power / is too loud: You need to account for GPU (~250W each), CPU (~180W), Other (~150W, Motherboard, fans, etc). Overclocking draws a lot of power as well. Some power supplies are loud, read reviews online for quietness info. Typically the 80+ Platinum rated ones are quieter. My CPU cooler blocks the first GPU slot: Big air coolers such as Noctua sometimes will block the first GPU slot. Search for others who have used the combo.\n\nA budget expandable Deep Learning Computer at $2k\n\nKnowing all this, you can see how the following is a budget expandable Deep Learning Computer that costs $2k and is also expandable to 4 GPUs.\n\nBudget computer before taxes, it\u2019s still expandable to 4 GPUs. As of Jan, 2020, you can replace the 1070 with the 2060 Super for $410. Prices for components have dropped a lot, you can get 1900X for $160. 32GB RAM for $150. 1TB EVO for $200.\n\nSave a thousand dollars as compared to buying\n\nIf you are considering buying a system instead of building one, you can get a 4x2080 Ti system from Exxact for $7,999, which is the best deal I\u2019ve found. The 2x2080 Ti system goes for $5,899. Building your own 4 GPU system in 2020 is a total of $6,600: $3,000 + $500 (upgrade to 2080 Ti) + 3 x $1,200 (3 more 2080 Ti) - $500 (NVMe and RAM are cheaper in 2020). So that\u2019s $1,400 (~20%) cheaper to build.\n\nThere are benefits to buying a pre-built though, such as a 3-year warranty, support, and pre-installed software. If you\u2019re a busy individual or buying for academia/a company and want to simplify your life, it\u2019s worth considering.\n\nExxact\u2019s ready-to-run Deep Learning computers with 3 year warranties\n\nOrdering and putting parts together\n\nDesign your build on PCPartPicker.com\n\nPCPartPicker is very useful because it lets you select parts and tells you if there are incompatibilities, it also gives you the best price across several reputable sellers.\n\nBandh, Adorama, Newegg, and Amazon are all reputable resellers. If in doubt, check Reseller Ratings.\n\nPutting parts together takes a few hours\n\nAssembly breaks down into the following 4 steps: 1) Case prep 2) Motherboard prep 3) Mount Motherboard 4) Install Memory, GPU and wrap up.\n\nHere is a short video of me assembling my computer:\n\nShort video on the actual assembly\n\nI also watched this build video for X399/Threadripper, you can probably find a similar video for your parts list.\n\nInstall software with online scripts and tutorials\n\nIf you follow tutorials, it\u2019s relatively easy to get the stack up. If you don\u2019t use tutorials or the wrong one, then it will be very frustrating!\n\nI installed Ubuntu 16.04 and used this tutorial for the CUDA/CuDNN/Tensorflow install. I think there\u2019s a prebuilt for Tensorflow now so you don\u2019t have to compile it from scratch.\n\nExpanding to more GPUs\n\nI added a Titan RTX, a 2080 Ti, and another 1080 Ti and it was really straight forward. You will have to upgrade your Nvidia driver to nvidia-410 to run the 2080 Ti.\n\nMy Deep Learning computer with 4 GPUs \u2014 one Titan RTX, two 1080 Ti and one 2080 Ti. The Titan RTX must be mounted on the bottom because the fan is not blower style.\n\nBenchmarking your Deep Learning Computer\n\nContinue to the next post: Why your personal Deep Learning Computer can be faster than AWS to learn what drives Deep Learning Performance and how your computer will stack up against the cloud.\n\nSee new photos and updates: Follow me on Medium and Twitter!\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy is expandability important in a Deep Learning Computer?\n\nIf you don\u2019t know how much GPU power you\u2019ll need, the best idea is to build a computer for Deep Learning with 1 GPU and add more GPUs as you go along.\n\nWill you help me build one?\n\nHappy to help with questions via comments / email. I also run the www.HomebrewAIClub.com, some of our members may be interested in helping.\n\nHow can I learn this stuff?\n\nStanford is giving away a lot of their CS curriculum. So look there. There are also great articles on more cutting edge research here.\n\nWhat models can I train?\n\nYou can train any model provided you have data, GPUs are most useful for Deep Neural Nets such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GANs. Some examples w/ code & datasets are listed on my website thisisjeffchen.com.\n\nVision and photo enhancement is really good now, which makes the new iPhone 11 amazing.\n\nMore FAQ: is located at the bottom of the page here.",

        "title": "Journal Your Way Through Anxiety To Have A Better Relationship With Your Emotions",
        "text": "Journal Your Way Through Anxiety To Have A Better Relationship With Your Emotions\n\nTen minutes per day is more than enough to make an impact.\n\nPhoto by Ava Sol on Unsplash\n\nI used to be an emotional wreck. My anxiety was high, and my self-esteem was at an all-time low. Negative thoughts often got the best of me. So as you can imagine, it didn\u2019t take long to enter an endless cycle of mental health problems, from which it was incredibly difficult to escape.\n\nOverthinking became commonplace. I struggled to look at myself in the mirror because I was deeply ashamed of what I looked like. Frequent feelings of anxiety took over my mind, and I often struggled to go outside because I was afraid of what other people thought of me. Saying my life sucked would be an understatement.\n\nBut one day, I stumbled across the habit of daily journaling. At first, I thought it was some cliche self-help gimmick. Deep down, I was incredibly skeptical. But after trying it out for a few weeks, I noticed the incredible impact it had on my emotional wellbeing. Quoting an article published by Harvard Medical School:\n\n\u201cThe act of thinking about an experience, as well as expressing emotions, seems to be important. In this way, writing helps people to organize thoughts and give meaning to a traumatic experience. Or the process of writing may enable them to learn to better regulate their emotions. It\u2019s also possible that writing about something fosters an intellectual process \u2014 the act of constructing a story about a traumatic event \u2014 that helps someone break free of the endless mental cycling more typical of brooding or rumination. Finally, when people open up privately about a traumatic event, they are more likely to talk with others about it \u2014 suggesting that writing leads indirectly to reaching out for social support that can aid healing.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like my past-self, you overthink\u2026 a lot. So if you want to improve your mental health and emotional wellbeing, writing down your emotions could be a great way to ease any feelings of anxiety, depression, or stress.\n\nHere\u2019s how to start.",

        "title": "What Being Broke Taught Me About Launching a Successful Business",
        "text": "You need to want it \u2014 above all of your fears\n\nMy ideas were the only thing keeping me going.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen the movie The Dark Knight Returns, but there\u2019s a scene in which Batman/Bruce Wayne, after being thrown into an inescapable pit by his nemesis Bane, has to risk his life to free himself. Only one other person in history had made the jump, and in both cases, it was the adrenaline from the fear of death which got them from A to B.\n\nSome of us are stuck in a pit, and we can\u2019t get to where we want to be\u2026because we aren\u2019t utilising our fear. If you know you have everything to lose, you work fast. For me, I knew if I didn\u2019t work, I wouldn\u2019t eat.\n\nPeriod.\n\nWork as though you have everything to lose. Use the pressure around you and take the risk. Put in the hours you need to, in order to train and make the jump that requires that level of faith.\n\nYou must be resourceful before you scale\n\nDon\u2019t dream big if you can\u2019t master the small.\n\nIf you\u2019re crappy with the small things, increasing size and reach just makes your crappiness even worse. The premise is the same in business. When you launch a new product or service, you need to make sure that you make the most of what you have before you facilitate growth, or get more people involved.\n\nIn the early stages of my start-up venture, I was a one-man-band. I created all the online marketing materials, I manned communication and admin, I wrote all the partnership documents. I responded to emails in third person to maintain professionalism.\n\nWithin a week, my start-up gained traction from over 200 users on social media, and within two weeks of opening my first community event, we were almost sold out.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating overwork. I\u2019m not saying to start a business right this moment. I\u2019m not saying to acquire any of these skills you don\u2019t have.\n\nI\u2019m saying to be resourceful. Max out before you add. I was forced to do this in the early days because I was broke. Make sure you\u2019re in a relatively good place with your venture or side hustle before pursuing growth.\n\nYou\u2019d be surprised what making use of what you have at your disposal can do for your business.\n\nYour business goals must have clearly defined metrics\n\nStop being so vague, for goodness\u2019 sake.\n\nI know it\u2019s comforting to aim for a multi-million-making business \u2014 but there\u2019s no point if you don\u2019t have a clear and logical way to get there. You can\u2019t order a taxi to a certain destination without first inputting your location.\n\nBeing broke meant that I needed to be very strategic with my money management, both in a personal capacity and in a business space. These were my goals:\n\nClear my $1000 overdraft\n\nPay my $900 rent\n\nSave at least $200 for launching my business.\n\nI carefully saved 10% of all my erratic revenue-generating activities and used the rest to pay off my debt and buy groceries.\n\nI still use this method now, although I save 30% of my income for business reinvestment. Although my aim was small, I had a clearly defined goal and a strategy on how to get there.\n\nIt\u2019s the same strategy I\u2019m using to make my first million. Watch this space.\n\nMonetary incentives for team members isn\u2019t enough\n\nDid you read that correctly?\n\nMoney isn\u2019t enough, and knowing that will save you a lot of aggravation when you start bringing people on board. It was easy for me to find out since I had no money. I was forced to find other ways to draw the kind of people I wanted to work with.\n\nI found my CTO (Chief Technology Officer) when she came across my business online. She emailed me straightaway. I told her straight up:\n\n\u201cLook, I can\u2019t offer you a salary right now. I\u2019m going through a rough patch myself so if you want to get on board, I need to know that I can still count on you.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, explaining that she wasn\u2019t even considering the money. She loved the cause, the idea, the business model. She bought into the vision.\n\nThe same occurred when our team grew. More people started dedicating their time and skills, not for money, but a genuine passion.\n\nIf I possessed the capacity to pay a salary, it would\u2019ve been the first way I would try to attract talented team members. But relying on passion and buy-in to the cause meant that I could weed out poor team members from the jump.\n\nIf you are looking for team members in your business venture, consider your value proposition.\n\nIf the only buy-in they express is money, I\u2019d advise you to keep looking.\n\nChanging behaviour is the key to success.\n\nYour goal isn\u2019t to make profit.\n\nThat\u2019s right. You aren\u2019t in business or entrepreneurship to make profit. Or sell a product or service, or fix a problem.\n\nWhat you need to focus on is how you will change behaviour.\n\nIt\u2019s no good fixing a problem if people won\u2019t buy into your solution. How will you impact the behavioural patterns of your chosen audience? When I had no money for fancy products or detailed consultancy services, I had to really dig deep and figure out what I was trying to do with my business.\n\nDuring the summer, I worked as a library assistant every so often to make ends meet. I processed hundreds of incoming and outgoing books. Students would sometimes ask me my thoughts on a particular book. \u201cThis one\u2019s a keeper,\u201d I might say, or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019d listen, and either take home the book or lay it on the table. It was reflecting on this that I truly understood what it meant to have a monopoly in business.\n\nThe most successful business has the authority to change behaviour. They are socially validated. As a librarian\u2019s assistant, I had the credentials and authority to provide a service and opinion, which changed the behaviour of the recipient.\n\nBrands like Apple don\u2019t need to do too much marketing beyond announcing the release of a new iPhone, and consumers will flock because Apple is perceived as the definitive authority capable of changing consumer behaviour with their brand.\n\nI applied this to my business. Suddenly, my whole brand and consultancy was about producing the changed behaviour which would attract more consumers. That\u2019s when my community grew \u2014 I wanted to change them, and they bought into it.\n\nWhen drafting out your business ideas, ensure your outputs are underpinned by the desire to change the behaviour of the consumer. Once you have their attention, you have authority.",

        "title": "Is Eco-anxiety the Future of Our Mental Health?",
        "text": "Is Eco-anxiety the Future of Our Mental Health?\n\nIf we don\u2019t act immediately, yes, it will be.\n\nPhoto by Fernando @cferdo on Unsplash\n\nWhat is the first thing that comes into your mind when you hear the words \u201cclimate change\u201d?\n\nNow, think about the second thing that comes into your mind.\n\nAnd now the third.\n\nDid any of your thoughts include its impacts on our mental health? And if so, was that your first, second, or third thought? When we think about climate change, we tend to overlook the importance of its psychological consequences.\n\n\u201cImagine you go outside and you look up in the sky, and there is a comet there. And\u2026 you just have been told by scientists that that comet is racing toward the Earth and it\u2019s going to kill everybody and everything in a big fiery storm, [but] nobody notices the comet. And you say, \u201cHey look, there is a comet and it\u2019s going to kill all of us\u201d, and people don\u2019t seem to care.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the American Psychological Association (APA) co-published a report, which focuses on the impacts of climate change on mental health. Just reading the introductory note, you can understand the importance of future related implications. As it is mentioned, depression, stress, social and community tension, aggression, violence, and crime are all associated consequences. The report also touches on eco-anxiety, which is termed in its glossary as \u201ca chronic fear of environmental doom\u201d. [1]\n\nSearching further, other definitions of eco-anxiety \u2014 or climate change anxiety \u2014 describe it as an existential fear, as it is mentioned, for example, by Dr. Steffi Bednarek, Psychotherapist, in this video made by BBC Northern Ireland. Dr. Bednarek also describes it as \u201can anxiety about the future and a trauma that we have not experienced yet, but that we know is going to come our way.\u201d She says that although climate change anxiety is a relatively new term, it\u2019s not new as a phenomenon. [2]\n\nWhat makes you understand better the feeling of eco-anxiety are the descriptions that sufferers give in BBC\u2019s video.\n\n\u201cWhen big ecological disasters happen around the world, I feel a sense of anxiety, I feel a sense of sadness and a sense of loss,\u201d says one. Another sufferer explains his eco-anxiety in a hypothetical context saying, \u201cImagine you go outside and you look up in the sky, and there is a comet there. And\u2026you just have been told by scientists that that comet is racing toward the Earth and it\u2019s going to kill everybody and everything in a big fiery storm, [but] nobody notices the comet. And you say, \u201cHey look, there is a comet and it\u2019s going to kill all of us\u201d and people don\u2019t seem to care.\u201d\n\nBut what exactly triggers eco-anxiety? In the video, the people who talk about their experience also refer to thoughts that make them feel eco-anxious.\n\nFor instance, one of them says that when he thinks about the fact that other parts of the world are more severely impacted by climate change, that triggers his anxiety. One of the other interviewees mentions \u201cthe fear of people mistreating each other out of panic and fear\u201d as one of his most stressful thoughts. Getting emotional, anger, powerlessness, frustration, and helplessness are feelings that the third interviewee in the video says she experiences due to thoughts related to climate change.\n\nWhat those people have in common is that they care about the environment and its protection; they care so much that the state of their mental health is seriously affected.\n\nSo, what we\u2019ll happen in the future if we don\u2019t act sufficiently and on time at the present? Will everybody \u2014 whether they care or not about climate change now\u2014 suffer from eco-anxiety?\n\nIn countries such as Bangladesh that have already been severely affected by climate change, it seems that the immediate impacts of the phenomenon on mental health are already noticeable. For example, this is evident through the work of Psychologist Amanda Carrico, Ph.D. Carrico, as it is mentioned in this article on APA\u2019s website, was told by a family in rural Bangladesh that they anguished over migrating to India to find work, after the productivity of their farmland was negatively impacted by climate change. [3]\n\nAs you can understand, or even have experienced yourself, agonizing over leaving your country and moving to one characterized as an \u201cincreasingly hostile to immigrants\u201d is a mentally straining situation to be. This, among other things, proves how climate change can affect adversely one\u2019s mental health.\n\nThus, thinking about possible scenarios and taking into consideration how climate change already affects many people psychologically, it seems that the most likely answer to the questions stated previously is this: Our future and that of generations to come will be impacted by eco-anxiety, severely.\n\nIf substantial action is not taken now, everything at some point will get worse. Then, we will all feel eco-anxious, because it won\u2019t longer have to do with mere thoughts about events happening \u201csomewhere else\u201d, but with experiences related to events happening in the cities we all live in.\n\nReferences:",

        "title": "The battle for replacing coal with renewable energy in Kosovo",
        "text": "The battle for replacing coal with renewable energy in Kosovo\n\nThe World Bank and US government have been planning support for a new coal plant in Kosovo for over a decade. But could the falling cost of renewable energy combined with cutting-edge air pollution research change the equation?\n\nNearly eight kilometers from the capital city of Pristina, two Yugoslav-era coal-fired power plants continue to generate electricity, heaving masses of particulate matter and trace metals into the air that float directly into the city. After the US Embassy in Pristina started posting the air quality index readings live on its website early this year, citizens took to the streets, demanding cleaner air for all. But for Kosovo, a country living on the edge of Europe, avoiding coal remains elusive \u2014 the lignite heats most homes and powers nearly all buildings, because Europe\u2019s newest country is sitting on the world\u2019s fifth largest lignite reserve. Kosovo doesn\u2019t need to rely so heavily on coal, however. With the falling cost of solar, wind, and now, storage, and the investment opportunities arising for clean energy options, the people living in Obilic have a clear choice for clean energy\u2013 if they\u2019re allowed to make it.\n\nKosovo A, the power plant with the dubious distinction as \u2018the largest point-source of pollution\u2019 in all of Europe, was built in the early 1960s as a mining and electricity generation operation. The mine-mouth plant evicted a number of residents from their homes, and through the years, as more resources have been extracted, it has encroached further upon local villagers\u2019 homes, setting off legal debates and a host of controversies surrounding the proposed construction of a new plant. The World Bank and multilateral development banks remain at the forefront of financing coal versus cleaner renewable energy projects. The banks have been deliberating the construction of a new coal plant for nearly a decade, but will they leave behind a community forced to evacuate due to coal mining or pave a new way forward to finance sustainable energy systems for the poorest, most vulnerable populations?\n\nFor nearly 20 years, as villagers in nearby Hade continue to fight for resettlement rights, the World Bank has been breaking its own rules and safeguards to accommodate new coal mining operations, exposing residents who stayed in their homes to continuous harmful dust and constant noise pollution. Efforts to promote energy efficiency and conservation in homes have helped raise awareness, yet still maintain reliance on the dirty low-rank lignite coal for electricity that is stifling economic development.\n\nThe need for green lending\n\nKosovo, on its own, cannot significantly invest in the energy sector, due to devalued credit and lack of capital. In spite of this, small local solar and wind companies are emerging to generate electricity in one of the sunniest spots across Southern Europe. However, now citizens are faced with the tough task of convincing lenders to invest in the green energy and new jobs that attract innovation and retain the country\u2019s talented youth. Without the option of clean electricity from major lenders, Kosovars are stuck paying the high cost of poor health, noxious air pollution, and few job opportunities for advancement and competitiveness.\n\nOne more major hitch remains if coal is continued for electricity generation \u2014 the dirty nature of the lignite itself.\n\nScientists at the University of California, Berkeley took samples of the lignite found in Kosovo back to the lab for elemental analysis. The elevated levels of arsenic, chromium, and nickel only tell part of the story, showing up in hospital admission records and high rates of air-pollution-related respiratory illness. Taking a drive through the coal mine exposes many of the contemporary social issues Kosovo faces, including a lack of jobs, opportunities, and mechanisation of dirty industry. The coal plant experiences frequent blackouts and due to a recent power trade dispute with Serbia, stopped generating electricity and slowed down European clocks by six minutes. The mine itself feels strangely open and empty except for the rows of houses perched right next to coalfields, still at odds and in direct conflict with the coal operators.\n\nA five-kilometre-long conveyor belt delivers the lignite coal from the mine to both Kosovo A and B in an open-air system. There are plenty of hazards for the few mine workers left, including dust exposure to untreated lignite coal containing unsafe levels of arsenic. The youngest populations are most at risk to these hazardous pollution, and to the hoards of youth protesting on the streets of Pristina, better air quality comes at a major tradeoff. If youth have family connections working outside of Kosovo or ability to work elsewhere, they will, and Germany looks pretty attractive for those seeking employment and new opportunities. However, for all the repatriated Kosovars now trained in green, clean-tech economies, why not enable a bank-funded program to repatriate new clean energy jobs in Kosovo? This investment option could make both economic and social wellbeing a priority for future energy infrastructure decisions that also considers future costs of a looming public health crisis.\n\nThomas Berg\n\nPart of the conversation surrounding a new \u2018clean coal\u2019 plant omits key information about a supercritical boiler that can generate electricity at a higher efficiency and heat than \u201860s-era coal plants. Higher temperature boilers can increase the amount of toxic trace metals present in the air emissions escaping the coal plant. New technologies may reduce sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides emissions relative to their current levels, but may not completely mitigate the full negative effects of combusting coal. Even the most advanced filters and de-NOx units can\u2019t change the low quality of the lignite fuel itself, highlighting the challenge for cleaner electricity supply.\n\nA sustainable path forward\n\nThe bright side is that resettlement doesn\u2019t need to be the solution anymore for those living next to the exposed, overburdened shadow of the lignite mines. Solar and wind electricity, along with coordinated regional efforts across southeast Europe, could bring cleaner electricity to the Kosovo power sector and create new jobs and opportunities that have been missing for more than a decade since the war ended.\n\n\u201cThe people living in Obilic have a clear choice for clean energy\u2013 if they\u2019re allowed to make it.\u201d\n\nA commitment toward European accession could include a jobs creation stimulus package that includes energy efficiency investments alongside supply-side resources to transition Kosovo from lignite toward cleaner electricity that can enable new jobs for the 21st century.\n\nKosovo is primed to be a major destination situated north of Greece and Macedonia, and close to the pristine Adriatic coastline. With fine wines and coffee industry gaining notoriety across the Balkans, why not ensure the air and water is clean and of high quality?\n\nAs great as the macchiatos and burgeoning wine industry, a healthy environment and sustainable energy plan underscores the need to ensure that the future of Kosovo lies in its history, culture, and people and not in the millions of tons of lignite best left in the ground. For the financial institutions with clear lending and decision-making power, the responsibility is to invest in the country\u2019s most abundant energy resources \u2014 that of solar, wind, small-hydro and geothermal renewable energy, which offer a lower-cost and lower-carbon pathway to sustainability \u2014 leaving the coal in the ground and the power with the people.",

        "title": "Want to Be a Writing Prodigy?",
        "text": "Maybe you were that kid who was given a writing prompt in grade school and got lost filling a page with words and ideas. When the time was up, you easily had a few complete pages.\n\nMaybe, like me, you were given a blank journal as a birthday gift and you began writing a book all your own. Whatever else happened in life, you knew at a young age that putting words to your intimate reality was something that only you could do. You identified as a writer. In fact, you were a writer. You had a book to prove it.\n\nPerhaps your third-grade teacher allowed you to skip English class and sit out in the hallway so you had quiet time to write your play? You included hand-drawn pictures (because no one told you a play didn\u2019t include pictures) of pirates and candy and pioneers \u2014 some mishmash of Little House on the Prairie, a children\u2019s book that belonged to your younger brother, and the game of Candyland. This before fan fiction was even a thing.\n\nOr you were one of the few dorks how actually relished diagramming sentences in the fifth grade. You had a pouch with red and black pens, a ruler, and a special notebook just for this task.\n\nHow lucky the child-writers\n\nDo children still get to enjoy this rare pleasure? Do adults notice? I live in a Texas school district where athletics trumps all. You never open the local news to see a picture of a kid hunched over a desk writing by the glow of a task lamp, but they\u2019re here. There are different kinds of Friday Night Lights, baby.\n\nKids who write do so in private, often filling pages and notebooks in secret. All you need is a quiet room and some time, and a pen and paper, of course... no computer, word processor, or laptop is necessary. And if you grew up in the 70s and 80s, writing was the perfect activity for bookish types of a certain age.\n\nIt\u2019s also an amazing activity for unleashing creativity in adults if you can stand the slow, sometimes hypnotic pace of handwriting.\n\nTake it slow and see what happens\n\nAn accomplished pianist I know once pointed out that adults who want to learn the piano are never content to start with Row, Row, Row Your Boat. They want to jump right into the Moonlight Sonata. Being able to slow down practice is a gift learned young.\n\nThe craft of writing \u2014 all art, actually \u2014 is hard work. Just like the young volleyball recruit going through her drills and the basketball player\u2019s early morning hoops, creatives must also accept the tedious pace of working through their craft.\n\nWhen you\u2019re writing with a pen in your hand, moving over a notebook, you are plumbing a deep, ancient, creative source.\n\nSince I could hold a pen, I\u2019ve written nearly every day of my life \u2014 at least a few words. I\u2019ve used journals, blank books, and blogs. I\u2019ve used pens and pencils and keyboards on all types of machines. And I can attest to the power of handwriting.\n\nThere\u2019s something about paper that helps me solidify thoughts better than a backlit screen. I\u2019ve rarely wanted to exchange that privilege with another. Writing on paper, with a pencil or pen, is a primal, creative act that pays huge creative dividends. Although I can write faster on a keyboard, I could never give up writing by hand. I\u2019d feel like I was missing something deeper and messier.\n\nBut the best writers are touch typists, right?\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, handwriting is so slow and tedious. You can\u2019t read your own writing after you\u2019re done. Your hand cramps. If you come up with anything good you just have to sit at a keyboard and re-write it anyway. I agree with all of that.\n\nI\u2019ve read many articles about successful writers who started writing as adults because they figured out how to write fast and furious. They naturally developed a voice that vibes great with their internet audience. They easily write/type in several languages and crank out stories like a machine. Maybe you, too, want to be that writer whose Medium earnings blow 98% of the rest of us out of the water. Though I practice daily, I\u2019m not there yet.\n\nSomewhere in every writer, though, there\u2019s a voice that won\u2019t go away. When I hear mine most clearly, I\u2019m usually not typing. I\u2019m holding a pen. Certain glittering, literary treasures only emerge when you write your sentences longhand.\n\nProficient learners are not necessarily prolific writers\n\nIn 2014, a widely circulated study showed that students who took class notes with a pen on paper retained complex concepts better than those who took notes on a laptop.\n\nThe research doesn\u2019t say which students got better grades.\n\nThe ones who took notes the old-school way acquired knowledge that stuck. Turns out the ones who tapped notes on a keyboard merely regurgitated what the professor said verbatim, resulting in shallower processing. When it came time to reformulate the lessons, they came up short.\n\nWhen students listen, process, and summarize concepts in longhand, they learn more during the actual lesson. Their brains were engaged in ways the typists were not. Makes sense.\n\nThe good and bad news is that the hand writers produce fewer words. They also tend to get, you know\u2026 creative. Since it takes longer to handwrite than type, the students actually think about what the instructor is saying and quickly pen it to paper, making sense in whatever way their brain decides is best. Rounding sharp corners, the working brain causes problems. At least I\u2019ve found this to be true.\n\nThe research doesn\u2019t say which students got better grades. Sometimes, overthinkers can make a beautiful mess of ideas as they churn them through their gray matter.\n\nBeyond note-taking, you stir the creative process \u2014 often more than you bargain for \u2014 when you write out your thoughts longhand.\n\nThis 30-year journaling trend\n\nArtistic types hoping to stimulate their creative juices widely adopted Julia Cameron\u2019s Morning Pages practice, which she describes in her 1992 book The Artist\u2019s Way. Almost thirty years later, it\u2019s still #1 on Amazon in the popular psychology, creativity, and genius category. [Note: the \u201cGenius\u201d category.]\n\nPeople swear by this stream-of-consciousness journal-writing practice first thing in the morning \u2014 I have occasionally done morning pages throughout my life, although I\u2019m not in a regular habit.\n\nMany writers intuitively know that writing by hand with a good pencil or gel pen brings out their genius. What is going on in the brain that makes handwriting so key to the creative process? Is there any conclusive neuroscience research to back up the claim that handwriting that unlocks creativity?\n\nSome startling handwriting facts\n\nBrain scans show you use more parts of the brain when you write by hand. Think about it: your hand needs to move over the paper and grip the pen (motor skills). You must remember how to form the letters (memory). You fill a page with lines of cursive (spatial reasoning). You construct sentences from thoughts (imagination and creativity). You also smell the ink and feel paper (tactile pleasures). Your entire brain is firing away.\n\nThere\u2019s also a link between handwriting and mindfulness. When you write, your brain lights up just as it would if you were meditating. This is great news for those who strive for productive mornings that don\u2019t end up killing half of your workday. Now you can skip the meditation practice and just write. One less thing.\n\nCertain glittering, literary treasures only emerge when you write your sentences longhand.\n\nThe handwriting child has an edge\n\nThere\u2019s something childlike and exploratory about handwriting \u2014 about writers in general, but those who write by hand, especially.\n\nSince you\u2019re activating more parts of the brain at once, you give it a better workout, so to speak. This is a bonus if you\u2019re an actual child. Children who learn to handwrite (and use it regularly) tend to write \u201cmore words, faster, and to express more ideas\u201d than those who use a keyboard.\n\nWorking brains cause problems. I\u2019ve found this to be true\u2026 Sometimes, overthinkers can make a beautiful mess of ideas as they churn them through their gray matter.\n\nAs a child who wrote a lot, I can attest to certain benefits. Some of them admittedly of the navel-gazing sort. But also the ability to write a decent college essay; being the go-to pro-bono writer of nonprofit press releases; not embarrassing oneself while composing interoffice emails; and the ability to land an average (but better than minimum wage) writing job in the first place.\n\nMeanwhile, written in the off-hours are there are these therapeutic personal essays\u2026\n\nI told you it gets messy. I suspect sometimes that too much creativity \u2014 can you have too much? \u2014 makes it difficult to make real money writing. Just a hunch.\n\nIs your creative edge worth it?\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the time I visited my brother in the workshop of the furniture maker who apprenticed him. My brother is a master craftsman of wood. The kind of carpenter who hand planes curving staircases and dovetails the joinery of drawers. He fusses over woodworking details very few people can appreciate or afford.\n\nAs we were walking around the shop I spotted a cardboard box from Ikea with the name of some chintzy shelving system \u2014 Kallax or Billy. Who knows how it got there, but its existence among the sawdust mocked the shop's efforts. \u201cDoing some resale?\u201d I kidded him.\n\nWhy work so hard when others make it look so easy? Recently a Medium writer I follow \u2014 someone I\u2019ll bet is all too familiar with the handwriting/creativity link \u2014 wrote a post about that insulting, ubiquitous \u201cHi\u201d story that parked on everyone\u2019s Medium home screen for days.\n\nI see you, Alison Acheson. So much for all that talk about writing great headlines.",

        "text": "My Favourite Productivity Advice Ever\n\nOn getting that large or neglected creative project done NOW, without the guilt of neglecting everything else.\n\nI don\u2019t use this every day, but I do use it when I\u2019m writing a book, have a deadline approaching, or just want some extra strength immersion in that intoxicating buzz of creative flow.\n\nIt\u2019s powerful but simple \u2013 when I want to prioritize a certain project, and get it done as quickly as I can, I do it first and ruthlessly ignore everything else. This means scheduling a time, preferably right upon waking up, and not doing anything else unless completely necessary. No computers, or phones, or even talking to anyone if not needed. Most importantly, HOLY CRAP DO NOT CHECK FACEBOOK, TWITTER, OR THE NEWS! This is especially important during stressful times \u2013 creativity really does require retreating from the outside world for awhile, and you can\u2019t do this if your brain has decided that there are impending dangers you must immediately attend to.\n\nFear is the root of creative block, so why subject yourself to it just before getting to work?\n\nWe\u2019re so used to the hyper-connectedness of our society that it almost seems wrong to unplug. People expect you to always be available to them, and to respond quickly. But does that mean you have to? Perhaps this is a belief worth questioning. Why do we feel entitled to each other\u2019s attention, time, and energy, right now? And why do we feel obligated to give it, too?\n\nWhether you think it\u2019s right or wrong, it\u2019s definitely an obstacle for a self-motivated creative. You could be neglecting the most important work of your life, just because of something like FOMO, someplace like Twitter. Or fear of someone getting mad because you didn\u2019t get their text. Doesn\u2019t that seem silly?\n\nWhat about the fear of missing out on amazing creative discoveries, life-changing inspiration, or the profound epiphanies often experienced with regular creative sessions? It\u2019s all there waiting for you to start paying attention to it.\n\nWith creative work, there\u2019s something special about being totally unplugged, waking up early, and getting right to it before anyone or anything interferes. I\u2019m not a morning person at all, but I will wake up enthusiastically for this. Without coffee. It\u2019s life-changing.\n\nIf you dream about going on a creative retreat, this could be the perfect DIY version.\n\nBlock off some mornings, even if you have to get up extra early, and make sure everyone knows not to disturb you.\n\nTurn your phone, computer, and any other devices off before bed, and when you wake up, leave them off! Take care of your basic needs, do some meditating, journaling, or whatever rituals you need to do to be ready to work, then begin your creative project. Leave your devices off until you\u2019re satisfied with your work session.\n\nSometimes for me this means leaving my phone and email off all day, and nothing bad has come of this yet.\n\nObviously if your task involves your computer or another device you can use some common sense here \u2013 maybe you can power up your laptop and leave the internet off, or at least stay signed out of email. Be strict, for your own sake.\n\nNot only do I survive when I go whole days without my phone and email, but I feel like a new person. The usual stream of inspiration becomes an all-encompassing cloud of creative power. Time-wasting habits are broken. Anxiety drops down to zero.\n\nImagine the profound effect of doing this every day, every morning, or even just once a week!\n\nIf you hate mornings and are thinking about trying this at night before bed instead, here is my word of caution: if you are truly in a state of flow while creating, you might find that your brain is so stimulated that you won\u2019t be able to sleep afterward. This side-effect of creativity is a great advantage if you decide to try a morning session though! Especially if you\u2019re excited about your work (which you should be).\n\nDo you give enough time and space your creative life to bloom? Do you prioritize the work that is most important to you? You deserve it, guilt-free.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nIf you are blocked:\n\nIf you feel lazy or unmotivated:\n\nIf you feel like a disaster:",

        "title": "A Virologist\u2019s Case For The COVID-19 Vaccine",
        "text": "A Virologist\u2019s Case For The COVID-19 Vaccine\n\nWhy I will be getting the vaccine when it becomes available\n\nPhoto by Ibrahim Boran on Unsplash\n\nRecent announcements from COVID-19 vaccine trials have sparked much interest and excitement. The first two vaccines announced from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are mRNA vaccines, whereas the third potential candidate finishing up late-stage clinical trials is a viral vector vaccine from Oxford/AstraZeneca. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine has been granted emergency approval in the UK and Canada, and it is very likely that it will gain this approval in the US today. Many other vaccines are in clinical trials and will likely be announcing results soon.\n\nAlthough these announcements have generated much excitement, there is a significant portion of the population that is hesitant to get excited about the possibility of a vaccine. Reasons for this hesitation range from concerns about the short time spent in clinical trials to concerns about what the vaccines contain.\n\nI am a virologist. I also tend to lean fairly conservative (whatever that means anymore) when it comes to many political issues. Since the majority of vaccine concerns are being voiced by conservatives, I wanted to take a minute to explain my perspective on getting the COVID-19 vaccine and why I plan on getting it when it becomes available. Most of this article will focus on the new mRNA vaccines as they are the leading candidates at the moment, but I will reference other vaccine platforms when relevant.\n\nIf you have concerns about whether or not you should get the vaccine, I hope these thoughts will help you as you think through that decision.\n\nThe vaccine is effective\n\nI plan on getting the vaccine because the clinical trial data shows that they will protect against the virus.\n\nPerhaps some of the most anticipated and exciting news about the COVID-19 vaccines in development is that they appear to be highly effective. This is the case for the two leading mRNA vaccines, at least. Pfizer announced that their vaccine was 95% effective against COVID-19 in their phase III clinical trials. The graph (figure 13 on page 58 of the report submitted to the FDA) showing cumulative COVID-19 cases in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, is about as clean and clear as you can get in a phase III clinical trial, showing a stark and definitive protective effect in the vaccine group.\n\nSimilarly, Moderna announced that their vaccine is 94.1% effective. These are very promising numbers. AstraZeneca was the third company to announce an effective vaccine, with one dosing regimen showing 62% effectiveness and another regimen showing 90% effectiveness. For comparison, the seasonal flu vaccine is typically 40\u201360% effective each year (this is in part due to the nature of the influenza virus compared to coronaviruses).\n\nTo be fair, these efficacy numbers are specific to the clinical trials environment. In the real world, vaccine effectiveness might be lower. However, these data showing very high vaccine effectiveness suggests that these vaccines work well and will protect a significant number of people. I would guess that efficacy rates in the wild will be quite similar to those reported above, if just slightly lower.\n\nThe vaccine is safe\n\nI plan on getting the vaccine because all signs point to the vaccine being safe.\n\nThe two leading vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA-based. mRNA is a natural molecule in our own cells, taking instructions coded in our DNA and presenting that information to proteins called ribosomes, which build proteins from the mRNA instruction. Coronavirus mRNA vaccines contain instructions that tell your cells how to make a Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) protein that is typically found on the outside of the virus. Your cells then take these instructions and make the protein, which they then present to your immune cells to recognize and make antibodies towards (this is an over-simplified explanation, but it serves our purposes).\n\nThis is actually what would happen in a normal infection, except in a normal infection, the virus would introduce instructions for your cells to make all the viral proteins instead of just the one that the vaccine has. There is therefore no possibility of infection from mRNA vaccines, because there are no instructions to make all the necessary virus components. Further, mRNA is an inherently unstable molecule, meaning that it will degrade rather quickly (and thus not stay in our cells for very long), and it cannot change our cell\u2019s DNA. This rationale is why mRNA vaccines are considered very safe.\n\nBut do we really know that these vaccines are safe? They\u2019ve only been in trials for a few months, and vaccines normally spend years in clinical trials, right?\n\nFrom years of vaccine research, we have a good understanding of vaccines and how they work in the body, so we have a good idea of what to be looking out for as far as adverse events or side effects, both severe and non-severe. For example, typical non-severe or minor adverse events often include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, fever, fatigue, and headache. These symptoms have been noted in the COVID-19 vaccine trials, and although they may be uncomfortable, they usually resolve within a few days. Severe adverse events that have been seen with other vaccines include seizures, anaphylaxis, and Guillian-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (note that GBS, the adverse effect with the most potential to have long lasting effects, has a prevalence of between 6 and 40 cases per 1 million people in the US, and being sick with diarrhea, lung, or sinus issues poses a greater risk for developing GBS than vaccines). We also know that typically these symptoms develop within days to months, not years down the road.\n\nWhile this is the first mRNA vaccine to be approved, there are several reasons to be confident in the safety of these vaccines. As explained above, the theoretical basis for mRNA vaccines gives every indication that they will be safe and not cause serious adverse effects. Further, mRNA vaccines have been in development for several years for other infectious diseases, such as influenza, and clinical trials had already begun.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine trials are also under intense scrutiny, as the whole world is watching for obvious reasons (for example, Oxford\u2019s vaccine trial results have generated questions and concerns from the scientific community). Independent review boards are being used to review the results to eliminate as much bias as possible.\n\nModerna has enrolled 30,000 participants and Pfizer nearly 44,000, and to date, there have been no severe adverse events following immunization. The AstraZeneca vaccine trial, which also enrolled around 30,000 participants, saw one participant develop spinal cord inflammation. The trial was immediately halted until review occured, and it was determined the patient developed multiple sclerosis and there was no evidence that this was related to the COVID vaccine.\n\nTo question the speed of development and approval of these vaccines is a legitimate concern. The development of a COVID-19 has proceeded at an unprecedented pace. This is especially true for mRNA vaccines, as the mRNA vaccine platform has yet to be approved for any disease. However, this rapid development does not mean that bad science is being done. It is indeed impossible to know all the downstream effects of these new vaccines. However, there has been no evidence to warrant any fear that these vaccines will be anything other than safe. Compare that with the known detrimental effects (both short term and long term) that COVID-19 can have on the body and I believe that the risk-benefit analysis weighs heavily on the side of the vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine will allow us to reclaim our social lives\n\nI plan on getting the vaccine because I want us all to be able to spend quality time with our friends and families again.\n\nThis year has been difficult for most of us, not only because of the pandemic but perhaps even more so because of what the pandemic has taken away from us: our social lives. I truly believe the short- and long-term mental health effects from social distancing and isolation are underappreciated as of yet. An effective vaccine holds the potential to allow us to reclaim our social lives without the fear of spreading the virus to those we love.\n\nAlthough there are some concerns that a vaccine will not fully allow us to get back to normal, I believe these concerns are overstated. An effective vaccine that is widely accepted by the public will severely limit the number of people that the coronavirus can infect, which in turn will drive down viral transmission. In the best-case scenario, there will not be enough people that the virus can infect to keep it in circulation.\n\nBut even if vaccination rates are much more modest, any proportion of the population that is immune to the virus should decrease viral transmission. Not to mention the fact that especially vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with risk factors, will have an option for a line of protection even if the general public is less than enthusiastic about the vaccine. We cannot let perfect be the enemy of good enough.\n\nTwo common objections\n\nThese are the main reasons I am planning on getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Honestly, for many people, getting the vaccine just seems like common sense. Why wouldn\u2019t you get the vaccine?\n\nYet, there are quite a few people who are hesitant to get the vaccine. And a growing number are voicing outright opposition to the vaccine. Hesitancy that spawns from uncertainty about the safety of a new vaccine is reasonable, though there is good reason to believe that the vaccine will be both safe and effective. However, there are a couple of claims that are making their rounds that are misleading people about the vaccine, causing unwarranted fear and opposition to the vaccine. This article would not be complete if I didn\u2019t address these concerns.\n\nThe vaccine does not contain poisons\n\nYou might come across some claims that the new COVID vaccines that they are making contain different chemical poisons. Statements like these are designed to frighten and intimidate, often using unfamiliar chemical names to frighten people. What statements like these are trying to imply is that there are chemicals in the vaccine that are toxic to our bodies.\n\nHowever, this misunderstands (or deliberately ignores) the definition of poison. Poison is a vague term, and it is determined by the dose. It is true that a lot of vaccines contain small amounts of different chemicals (with long, frightening names) that are used at various stages of the production process, but the amount of these chemicals in the final vaccine products is minuscule. For example, the amount of formaldehyde, a common chemical named as one of the \u2018poisons\u2019, in a vaccine is less than the amount of formaldehyde that our own cells produce as a natural by-product of metabolism (for more information about vaccine safety, see my article, \u201cYour Flu Questions Answered\u201d). So, to call that poison is to misuse the concept of poison.\n\nThe COVID vaccines are going through rigorous safety trials, and the only ones that will get FDA approval will be those that can show that they are both safe and effective. And as stated above, the safety data for the mRNA vaccines is looking very good. It is true that we cannot know for certain the long-term safety profile of these new vaccines, but this is also true of any novel medicine or medical device. The vaccines will continue to be closely monitored for safety even after they pass through Phase III clinical trials. However, there is no reason at the moment, from theory or clinical trials, to believe that these vaccines will be anything but safe. On the other hand, we can be quite sure that COVID-19 will continue to harm and kill people in the absence of a vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine does not contain aborted fetal tissue\n\nStatements asserting that the COVID vaccine contains or is made with aborted fetal tissue are increasingly becoming a common refrain in some circles opposing the vaccine. These statements are not new among those who have opposed vaccination for years, but rather have been recycled for various vaccines.\n\nWhat is new, however, is that I am starting to hear this line of reasoning in the more mainstream conservative community in reference to the COVID vaccine. The reason for this is fairly obvious. Abortion is being used as a trigger word to rally conservatives that would not normally fall into to the far-right community, but already have some concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine. And it is an effective persuasion tool. However, this statement is at best a half-truth designed to mislead, and at worst an outright lie.\n\nTo begin, I want to make one thing abundantly clear: none of the vaccines currently in development contain aborted fetal tissue. The two leading mRNA vaccines contain lipids and mRNA, and the next contender (Janssen) is based on a recombinant protein encoded in a viral vector. More traditional vaccine approaches use a weakened or killed form of the virus that causes COVID-19. Any statement that asserts the new COVID-19 vaccine contains aborted fetal tissue is simply incorrect.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, we can look into where statements about aborted fetal tissue originate. As far as I can tell, claims such as these are based on the fact that research groups and companies often use a particular cell line, named HEK-293 cells, during their vaccine development stage. It is true that the HEK293 cell line was derived from an aborted fetus in 1973 in the Netherlands. However, there are several important points that need to be discussed before we use this as a reason to oppose vaccines.\n\nFirst, the reason for the abortion is unknown. The scientist who derived the cell line from the fetus could not recall the circumstances in which he obtained the fetus. What is certain, however, is that reason for the abortion had nothing to do with the scientist making the cell line with the tissue (it could have even been a spontaneous abortion \u2014 we just don\u2019t know). There is little moral ground for blaming the scientist in this situation. As a parallel, if an organ donor is murdered, we wouldn\u2019t say it is morally reprehensible to use his/her organs to save a life on the basis that the murder itself was immoral.\n\nSecond, the HEK293 cell line is a very popular cell line in biological/medical research (probably second only to HeLa cells, another cell line with a controversial origin story) and is used in practically every major lab and biotech company that exists today. They are widely used to study various aspects of infection, vaccine, and drug effects. They work very well in genetic assays, often playing a vital role in genetic research.\n\nSo, if research with this cell line provides grounds to not get the COVID vaccine, then it also provides grounds not to get any vaccines (which certain groups would likely agree with) or medications at all, as practically every lab that has produced modern therapeutic agents has used this cell line at some point, from cancer labs to infectious disease groups to basic biology researchers.\n\nFinally, and relating to the original point, whereas HEK293 cells have likely been used at some point in researching a vaccine, they are not used to produce the vaccine. The cells are used in the testing process, not the development of the actual vaccine.\n\nActually, if you support the claims that vaccines contain trace amounts of the cells they are grown in, you should be for the new mRNA platform of vaccination. All components of mRNA vaccines can be made completely free from any animal-based products. They are not grown in human cells at all, much less the HEK293 cell line.\n\nBut even the traditional approaches to the COVID-19 vaccine would not use HEK293 cells to grow the virus. These cells simply do not work well to produce large amounts of virus. Rather, another cell line, called Vero cells (derived from African green monkey kidney cells) has proven to be the best at producing large amounts of the coronavirus, and it is likely that this would be the cell line of choice for the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIn sum, the vaccine itself does not contain (or use) aborted fetal tissue; however, the research process that led to the vaccine likely at some point used that cell line. Just like the research that led to most modern medicines that save countless lives today.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are struggling over whether or not you should get the vaccine when it becomes available, I hope this helps you think through the decision. I know that it can be a tough choice due to the different uncertainties and concerns that you may have, or might have heard about from close friends and family. However, I think the theory and data for the new vaccines are solid, showing them to be both safe and effective.\n\nI plan on getting the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. I hope you will too.",

        "title": "John Steinbeck on How to Confront Your Writing Fears",
        "text": "Do you struggle with fear as a writer?\n\nFear that your writing isn\u2019t good enough? That people will criticize what you write? That you\u2019ll write one good story and then never be able to write anything else?\n\nFears like these can feel overwhelming and make you think that maybe you should just give up on writing. It\u2019s easy to imagine that the greatest writers confidently showed up each day at their desks with words flowing effortlessly from their fingers.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. Even the greatest writers are not immune to fear and self-doubt.\n\nNobel laureate John Steinbeck was one famous writer who wrestled with insecurity and anxiety throughout his entire writing career. But he didn\u2019t let those fears defeat him.\n\nRead on to discover his invaluable advice for how to confront your writing fears.\n\nJohn Steinbeck\u2019s Disillusionment as a Young Writer\n\nOn March 8, 1962 John Steinbeck wrote a letter to Edith Mirrielees, his former creative writing professor at Stanford University. Steinbeck had studied English Literature at Stanford but never completed his degree.\n\nIn the letter, he reminisces over his college years and his time in Mirrielees\u2019s story writing class. He had shown up to the class with the hope that Mirrielees would reveal a formula for writing good short stories.\n\nHowever, this hope was soon dashed. He writes,\n\n\u2026Although it must be a thousand years ago that I sat in your class in story writing at Stanford, I remember the experience very clearly. I was bright-eyed and bushy-brained and prepared to absorb from you the secret formula for writing good short stories, even great short stories. You canceled this illusion very quickly. The only way to write a good short story, you said, was to write a good short story. Only after it is written can it be taken apart to see how it was done. It is a most difficult form, you told us, and the proof lies in how very few great short stories there are in the world.\n\nMirrielees was giving her students a dose of reality. There was no magic formula to follow that would result in a prize-winning story in one go. Rather, writing was a journey of blood, toil, tears, and sweat.\n\nAt the time, Steinbeck was not prepared to hear that. He writes,\n\nThe basic rule you gave us was simple and heartbreaking. A story to be effective had to convey something from writer to reader and the power of its offering was the measure of its excellence. Outside of that, you said, there were no rules. A story could be about anything and could use any means and technique at all \u2014 so long as it was effective.\n\nSteinbeck soon realized that nearly all of his stories did not measure up to Mirrielees\u2019s rule. This greatly discouraged him. He observes,\n\nSo there went the magic formula, the secret ingredient. With no more than that you set us on the desolate lonely path of the writer. And we must have turned in some abysmally bad stories. If I had expected to be discovered in a full bloom of excellence, the grades you gave my efforts quickly disillusioned me. And if I felt unjustly criticized, the judgments of editors for many years afterwards upheld your side, not mine.\n\nSteinbeck began to doubt his skills as a writer. The struggle to transfer one\u2019s emotions onto paper can be exhausting and fraught with fear. He laments,\n\nIt seemed unfair. I could read a fine story and could even know how it was done, thanks to your training. Why could I not do it myself? Well, I couldn\u2019t, and maybe it\u2019s because no two stories dare be alike.\n\nAnd, yet, despite his disillusionment, Steinbeck refused to give up. What was his secret that kept him pushing forward?\n\nHow Steinbeck Was Able to Write Through His Fears\n\nSteinbeck must have been tempted over the years to put away his typewriter and not write another line. The daily diary that he kept while working on The Grapes of Wrath reveals how agonizing it was for him to continue writing.\n\nIn one entry, he writes,\n\nI am assailed with my own ignorance and inability\u2026Sometimes, I seem to do a good little piece of work, but when it is done it slides into mediocrity\u2026\n\nIn another,\n\nMy work is no good, I think \u2014 I\u2019m desperately upset about it\u2026I\u2019m slipping. I\u2019ve been slipping all my life.\n\nBut there was something that compelled him to keep coming back to his manuscript. In the letter to Mirrielees, he writes,\n\nOver the years I have written a great many stories and I still don\u2019t know how to go about it except to write it and take my chances. If there is a magic in story writing, and I am convinced that there is, no one has ever been able to reduce it to a recipe that can be passed from one person to another. The formula seems to lie solely in the aching urge of the writer to convey something he feels important to the reader. If the writer has that urge, he may sometimes but by no means always find the way to do it.\n\nDespite his fears, Steinbeck knew that he was called to be a writer. There was a passion deep within him that could only be satisfied by getting his thoughts down on paper. He knew that he had something valuable to say to his readers, and he wasn\u2019t about to let his fears destroy him.\n\nDid he have a special formula for overcoming those fears? Unfortunately not. He admits to Mirrielees,\n\nIt is not so very hard to judge a story after it is written, but after many years, to start a story still scares me to death.\n\nSo how did Steinbeck find a way to write through his fear? Steinbeck shares an invaluable piece of wisdom in his letter. He observes,\n\nI will go so far as to say that the writer who is not scared is happily unaware of the remote and tantalizing majesty of the medium.\n\nEssentially, his secret was this: he accepted his fears as an unavoidable part of his writing journey and eventually came to see them as validation that he was a serious writer.\n\nWhat to Do When Fear Threatens to Sabotage Your Writing\n\nThe novelist Steven Pressfield in his nonfiction book The War of Art writes,\n\nAre you paralyzed with fear? That\u2019s a good sign. Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do. Remember one rule of thumb: the more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.\n\nBut don\u2019t let those fears continue to paralyze you. Those fears are telling you that you need to roll up your sleeves and get to work. Like Steinbeck, we must continue writing if only to silence the critic who is ourselves.\n\nEveryone\u2019s fears are unique to their own situation and will require different methods to keep them in check.\n\nMaybe you will find it encouraging to read about the lives of famous writers who have struggled with the same difficulties as you.\n\nOr perhaps like Steinbeck you will find a writing notebook helpful.\n\nOr maybe you will need to set a daily word count goal and find friends to keep you accountable.\n\nIn 1962, Steinbeck shared this advice for writing through fear in a letter to his friend Robert Wallsten,\n\nForget your generalized audience. In the first place, the nameless, faceless audience will scare you to death and in the second place, unlike the theater, it doesn\u2019t exist. In writing, your audience is one single reader. I have found that sometimes it helps to pick out one person \u2014 a real person you know, or an imagined person and write to that one.\n\nWhatever method you use, the most important step is to not let the fear stop you from getting started. Just begin and then refuse to quit.\n\nAs Steinbeck writes in the same letter to Wallsten,\n\nLose track of the 400 pages and write just one page for each day, it helps. Then when it gets finished, you are always surprised\u2026Write freely and as rapidly as possible and throw the whole thing on paper. Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down. Rewrite in process is usually found to be an excuse for not going on.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nAt the end of his letter to Mirrielees, Steinbeck reminds her of a final piece of writing advice she gave him when he decided he was going out into the world to try to be a writer. Steinbeck writes,\n\nBut surely you were right about one thing, Edith. It took a long time \u2014 a very long time. And it is still going on and it has never got easier. You told me it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe writing journey requires much courage and fortitude. But don\u2019t become discouraged if you are overcome by fear and uncertainty.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be scared. It\u2019s a normal part of the writing process, a rite of passage that every writer experiences.\n\nAs Steven Pressfield observes,\n\nIf you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), \u2018Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?\u2019 chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.\n\nFear is proof you are on the right path, proof that you care about your readers, proof that you will keep pushing yourself to improve your craft, proof that you are doing something truly brave. You are willing to spill your heart out on paper and let others judge your work.\n\nIf Steinbeck had run from his fear, the world would have lost out on his towering literary contributions. The same is true for you. You have a story that only you can tell. Don\u2019t let fear hold you back from sharing your voice with the world.\n\nUltimately, it is how you respond to fear that determines whether or not you will become a truly great writer.",

        "title": "What to Know About Serious Adverse Effects and Deaths in the Moderna Vaccine Data",
        "text": "What to Know About Serious Adverse Effects and Deaths in the Moderna Vaccine Data\n\nThere were 13 deaths, but none are considered related to the vaccine\n\nCredit: NurPhoto/Contributor/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, a panel of medical experts met to discuss the Covid-19 vaccine produced by Moderna, with the goal of deciding whether to recommend emergency use approval of the vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Among the many topics they covered in the eight-hour livestream, they discussed deaths and serious adverse events documented in Moderna\u2019s data.\n\nThis information was included in a briefing document published by the FDA ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. As in Pfizer\u2019s trial data, which showed that six people had died but that none of those deaths were related to the vaccine, the Moderna data also included some deaths. Thirteen people in Moderna\u2019s 30,000-person trial died as of December 3. Seven of those people were in the placebo group and didn\u2019t receive the vaccine, and six were in the group of people who got the vaccine. None of the deaths were deemed related to the vaccine treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, for context, that the deaths of over 307,000 Americans have been attributed, definitively, to Covid-19.\n\nOf the people who died in Moderna\u2019s vaccine group, two were over the age of 75 and had preexisting cardiac disease. One of them died from a cardiopulmonary arrest after the first dose, and the other died of a heart attack after the second dose. Another person was 70 years old with cardiac disease and was found dead at home 57 days after getting the second dose.\n\nOne person who died was 72 years old and had Crohn\u2019s disease and short bowel syndrome. After getting the second dose, they were hospitalized for thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets in the blood) and acute kidney failure due to obstructive kidney stones, and complications led to multiorgan failure and then death.\n\nAnother person was 56 years old, with hypertension and chronic back pain that was treated with opioids. This person died, 37 days after getting the first dose, with head trauma listed as the official cause. A sixth person died of suicide 21 days after the first dose.\n\n\u201cThese deaths,\u201d notes the FDA report, \u201crepresent events and rates that occur in the general population of individuals in these age groups.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s data documented some serious adverse events (SAEs) too. One person had intractable nausea the day after receiving the second dose. Two had facial swelling days after getting the second dose, and both of them had a history of getting cosmetic dermal filler injections in their cheeks. Another person reported swelling in the lips two days after vaccination; they had previously received cosmetic dermal fillers injected into their lips. All of these people recovered with the help of antihistamines or a steroid course, and an expert noted that these risks would be included in the prescribing documents.\n\nNonserious adverse effects included pain at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle and joint pain, and chills \u2014 common side effects related to vaccination. People in the vaccine group had higher rates of lymphadenopathy (specifically, swelling of the lymph node in the armpit and tenderness in the vaccination arm) and hypersensitivity events like rashes and hives, though nobody in the trial reported anaphylaxis. (For comparison, a handful of people with a history of severe allergic reaction have experienced anaphylaxis after getting the Pfizer vaccine.)\n\nThree people in the vaccine group also developed Bell\u2019s palsy, a condition in which half the muscles in the face temporarily become paralyzed or weakened. All of the people who had Bell\u2019s palsy had preexisting conditions that make it hard to pin the cause on the vaccine, but \u201cconsidering the temporal association and biological plausibility,\u201d the FDA paper notes, \u201ca potential contribution of the vaccine to the manifestations of these events of facial palsy cannot be ruled out.\u201d The FDA recommends further surveillance of this condition if the vaccine gets an EUA. Researchers have previously raised concerns about Bell\u2019s palsy as an adverse event of other vaccines (in adults and in children), but there does not appear to be a consensus on this question.\n\nIn a Q&A following the safety segment, Paul Offit, MD, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed out that the rates of Bell\u2019s palsy in both Moderna\u2019s and Pfizer\u2019s trials were higher than known baseline levels (about 40,000 people in the United States annually), noting, \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure how we are so comfortable with this being a background rate.\u201d Rachel Zhang, MD, a medical officer on the FDA panel who presented the safety data, assured him, \u201cThis is something we\u2019re looking into and thinking a lot about.\u201d",

        "title": "An Introduction to 5 Types of Image Annotation",
        "text": "Looking for information on the different image annotation types? In the world of AI and machine learning, data is king. Without data, there can be no data science. For AI developers and researchers to achieve the ambitious goals of their projects, they need access to enormous amounts of high-quality data. In regards to image data, one major field of machine learning that requires large amounts of annotated images is computer vision.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Computer Vision? What is Image Annotation? Common Image Annotation Types 2D Bounding Boxes 3D Bounding Boxes / Cuboids Polygons Lines and Splines Semantic Segmentation\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read the entire article? Watch our 5-minute video instead!\n\nWhat is Computer Vision?\n\nComputer vision is one of the biggest fields of machine learning and AI development. Put simply, computer vision is the area of AI research that seeks to make a computer see and visually interpret the world. From autonomous vehicles and drones to medical diagnosis technology and facial recognition software, the applications of computer vision are vast and revolutionary.\n\nSince computer vision deals with developing machines to mimic or surpass the capabilities of human sight, training such models requires a plethora of annotated images.\n\nWhat is Image Annotation?\n\nImage annotation is simply the process of attaching labels to an image. This can range from one label for the entire image or numerous labels for every group of pixels within the image. A simple example of this is providing human annotators with images of animals and having them label each image with the correct animal name. The method of labeling, of course, relies on the image annotation types used for the project. Those annotated images, sometimes referred to as ground truth data, would then be fed to a computer vision algorithm. Through training, the model would then be able to distinguish animals from unannotated images.\n\nWhile the above example is quite simple, branching further into more intricate areas of computer vision like autonomous vehicles requires more intricate image annotation.\n\nWhat are the Most Common Image Annotation Types?\n\nWondering what image annotation types best suit your project? Below are five common types of image annotations and some of their applications.\n\n1. Bounding Boxes\n\nFor bounding box annotation, human annotators are given an image and are tasked with drawing a box around certain objects within the image. The box should be as close to every edge of the object as possible. The work is usually done on custom platforms that differ from company to company. If your project has unique requirements, some companies can tweak their existing platforms to match your needs.\n\nOne specific application of bounding boxes would be autonomous vehicle development. Annotators would be told to draw bounding boxes around entities like vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists within traffic images.\n\nDevelopers would feed the machine learning model with the bounding-box-annotated images to help the autonomous vehicle distinguish these entities in real-time and avoid contact with them.\n\n2. 3D Cuboids\n\nMuch like bounding boxes, 3D cuboid annotation tasks annotators with drawing a box around objects in an image. Where bounding boxes only depicted length and width, 3D cuboids label length, width, and approximate depth.\n\nWith 3D cuboid annotation, human annotators draw a box encapsulating the object of interest and place anchor points at each of the object\u2019s edges. If one of the object\u2019s edges are out of view or blocked by another object in the image, the annotator approximates where the edge would be based on the size and height of the object and the angle of the image.\n\n3. Polygons\n\nSometimes objects in an image don\u2019t fit well in a bounding box or 3D cuboid due to their shape, size, or orientation within the image. As well, sometimes developers want more precise annotation for objects in an image like cars in traffic images or landmarks and buildings within aerial images. In these cases, developers might opt for polygonal annotation.\n\nWith polygons, annotators draw lines by placing dots around the outer edge of the object they want to annotate. The process is like a connect the dots exercise while placing the dots at the same time. The space within the area surrounded by the dots is then annotated using a predetermined set of classes i.e. cars, bicycles, trucks. When assigned more than one class to annotate, it is called a multi-class annotation.\n\n4. Lines and Splines\n\nWhile lines and splines can be used for a variety of purposes, they\u2019re mainly used to train machines to recognize lanes and boundaries. As their name suggests, annotators would simply draw lines along the boundaries you require your machine to learn.\n\nLines and splines can be used to train warehouse robots to accurately place boxes in a row, or items on a conveyor belt. However, the most common application of lines and splines annotation is autonomous vehicles. By annotating road lanes and sidewalks, the autonomous vehicle can be trained to understand boundaries and stay in one lane without veering.\n\n5. Semantic Segmentation\n\nWhereas the previous examples on this list dealt with outlining the outer edges or boundaries of an object, semantic segmentation is much more precise and specific. Semantic segmentation is the process of associating every single pixel in an entire image with a tag. With projects requiring semantic segmentation, human annotators will be usually be given a list of pre-determined tags to choose from with which they must tag everything within the page.\n\nUsing similar platforms used in polygonal annotation, annotators would draw lines around a group of pixels they want to tag. This can also be done with AI-assisted platforms where, for example, the program can approximate the boundaries of a car, but might make a mistake and include the shadows underneath the car in the segmentation. In those cases, human annotators would use a separate tool to crop out the pixels that don\u2019t belong. For example, with training data for autonomous vehicles, annotators might be given instructions like \u201cPlease segment everything in the image by roads, buildings, cyclists, pedestrians, obstacles, trees, sidewalks, and vehicles.\u201d\n\nAnother common application of semantic segmentation is medical imaging devices. For anatomy and body part labeling, annotators would be given a picture of a person and be told to tag each body part with the correct body part names. Semantic segmentation can also be used for incredibly specialized tasks like tagging brain lesions within CT scan images.",

        "text": "TensorFlow or PyTorch? A Guide to Python Machine Learning Libraries (with examples!)\n\nLearn the top Machine Learning libraries for Python with code examples and tutorials for TensorFlow, Therano, Caffe, PyTorch, and Sci-Kit Learn.\n\nOriginally published at kite.com\n\nIntroduction\n\nPython is the fastest-growing programming language out there. That isn\u2019t surprising given that it\u2019s simple, easy to use, free, and applicable for many computing tasks. Data scientists in particular have embraced Python\u2019s efficient syntax, learnability, and easy integrations with other languages such as C and C++.\n\nAll these positive qualities, along with the recent spike of interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, can help explain the plethora of powerful open-source libraries and frameworks for machine learning and data science applications. There are libraries that can be put to use in a multitude of applications, including:\n\nnatural language processing / NLP (tensorflow)\n\nvisualization and analysis of complex data (therano)\n\nimage recognition (caffe)\n\nprediction and recommendation\n\nOpen-source frameworks have popped up to address all of the above applications, and now it can be confusing to decide on which library to use for which project. Tensorflow or Sci-kit? Should I use Keras on top of Microsoft\u2019s CNTK? What\u2019s the best application to use MXNet?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve determined the goals and overall priorities for your project, this article can help you select the language that is the best fit for your project. Some of the questions that you\u2019ll need to consider include:\n\nYour confidence level with machine learning fundamentals\n\nIf you will be using the framework for classic machine learning algorithms or for Deep Learning\n\nWhat application you will be using the framework for: be it heavy numerical computations, complex data analysis, image analysis, or education and research\n\nWhether or not you\u2019ll be using any additional hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), software, or cloud services for scaling on to bigger data sets.\n\nEach open-source framework available today has its own strengths and weaknesses when measured across these factors. And choosing the best framework for your needs will really depend on just what you want to accomplish. For example, if you are new to machine learning or want to use classic machine learning algorithms, Sci-kit could be the best choice. On the other hand, if you need to do heavy numerical computations, Theano would work much better. In any case, no matter your specific situation \u2014 this guide will aim to help you figure out which framework is the perfect fit.\n\nOverview of the top ML libraries for Python\n\nAmong all the myriad of options available for open-source Python frameworks, here is the compilation of our top 5 choices in descending order. You can follow along with examples for each library, stored in Kite\u2019s github repository.\n\n5. Sci-Kit Learn\n\nIdeal for: ML beginners\n\nSci-kit Learn is a library that features a host of the classical machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), KNN Maps, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers, Random Forests, and regression algorithms. It includes options for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Thus, it\u2019s ultimately an effective tool for statistical modeling. It has been built on many other Python libraries like SciPy, Numpy, and Matplotlib, and some of its core algorithms are also written using Cython. I created an example of a Sci-Kit operation here.\n\nStrengths:\n\nGreat for beginners and for those looking to explore machine learning algorithms\n\nGood for data-mining and simple projects like predictions on small or labeled data sets\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nDoes not support ANNs\n\nDoes not support GPU computing\n\nWhat sets this framework apart from others is an easy-to-use interface for developers and a high level of abstraction that allows especially beginners in machine learning to get easily acquainted with the platform, without having to deal with the nitty-gritty of actual algorithms.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to run and debug, and there are some nice and easy tutorials available to help understand the algorithms when you do have to work with them. However, Sci-kit Learn does have a couple of limitations.\n\nFirstly, it does not support Artificial Neural Networks. Secondly, it\u2019s only suitable for small projects with small datasets, and for tasks that are not particularly computationally intensive. This is mainly due to the fact that the framework does not support GPU computing. For more seasoned or hard-core developers, it can feel limiting to some extent, as the abstraction doesn\u2019t allow for fine tuning the underlying algorithms.\n\n4. Theano\n\nIdeal for: Hardcore developers requiring high-speed computation over a single GPU\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a framework that can crunch numbers like a pro, then Theano will be your best bet. Theano is a workhorse well-equipped for numerical computing and sits under a large number of other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras. The framework lets you efficiently work with mathematical expressions that include multi-dimensional arrays.\n\nStrengths:\n\nEfficiency in crunching large and multi-dimensional data sets\n\nProvides the developer ample flexibility to fine-tune underlying algorithms and create novel models.\n\nWeakness:\n\nA very steep learning curve\n\nDoes not support scaling over multiple GPUs\n\nWhile Sci-kit Learn is for beginners, Theano is only for advanced deep learning experts. The API is low-level, so you really need feel comfortable in your coding abilities if you\u2019re looking to explore this framework. The syntax for Theano is quite tightly integrated with NumPy and its code can run efficiently \u2014 both on a CPU and a GPU. You can see an example of a script using Therano here.\n\nIn contrast to Sci-kit learn, Theano empowers any developer with a complete flexibility to fine-tune and control their models. It even allows the developer to implement and test completely unconventional models. Although Theano works better than Tensorflow over a single GPU, it still doesn\u2019t match up to Tensorflow when working with multiple GPUs.\n\nHowever, since Theano has been around longer, it does have a lot more documentation. The biggest drawback is that MILA, the makers of Theano, have decided to stop maintaining the framework following its 1.0 release. Nonetheless, it continues to be a great choice for avid deep learning enthusiasts.\n\n3. Caffe\n\nIdeal for: Mid-level programmers and image processing\n\nCaffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) was mainly built to support Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is the framework of choice for those working on computer vision, image processing, and feedforward networks. The framework is a Python-based API, which was mainly written in C++. Models in Caffe are represented by Protobuf configuration files and the framework, is, in fact, the fastest CNN implementation among all Deep Learning frameworks. It works well on image segmentation and classification tasks. With a single GPU, Caffe can process more than 60 million images in a day! Here is a simple example of using a pre-trained Caffe model to correctly identify an image as the digit, \u201c5\u201d.\n\nStrengths:\n\nHas great ready-to-use models for image recognition\n\nIt is the fastest CNN implementation framework\n\nModels and optimizations are configured rather than coded\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nNot suitable for RNNs\n\nPoor documentation\n\nCreating new layers requires defining full forward, backward and gradient updates\n\nThe best thing about Caffe is that models and optimizations are not \u2018coded\u2019, but rather \u2018configured\u2019 \u2014 this reduces a lot of headaches for developers. So, if you have a large set of images that you need to classify or run some regression algorithms on, you can quickly apply a DL Network without having to write even a line of code. You can also train over multiple GPUs, but this has some limitations: for example, you can\u2019t do model/data parallelism. Another upside of Caffe is that it has a pretty good developer community \u2014 there\u2019s a whole \u2018Model Zoo\u2019 available where you can find a number of CNN implementations and models, like AlexNet, GoogleNet, NIN, etc. This is something that other frameworks lack.\n\nAlthough the framework is great for CNNs and image processing, it\u2019s not suitable for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and applications involving text, sound, and time series data. Moreover, even though there are a lot of layers ready to be implemented, the creation of new layers can be tedious, as one would need to define full forward, backward and gradient updates for each new layer. Besides, the framework offers a medium-level abstraction \u2014 it\u2019s high-level enough to allow you to do quick experiments and flexible enough to allow you to fine-tune some of the aspects. This detail may be a pro for mid-level developers, but it feels somewhat limiting for hardcore developers.\n\n2. Pytorch\n\nIdeal for: Both academic use and production\n\nPytorch was developed using Python, C++ and CUDA backend. Created by the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research team (FAIR), Pytorch is fairly new but is already competing neck-to-neck with Tensorflow, and many predict it will soon become a go-to alternative to many other frameworks.\n\nStrengths:\n\nCoding is easy, so it has a flatter learning curve\n\nSupports dynamic graphs so you can adjust on-the-go.\n\nSupports GPU acceleration\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nQuite new, so it has a smaller community and fewer resources available online\n\nPytorch is being lauded particularly by beginners, mostly due to its easy-to-write code \u2014 but the framework is basically a blend of both high and low-level APIs. In actuality, it\u2019s suitable for both academic uses as well as hard-core deep learning. It features a number of pre-trained models and when coding in Pytorch, you don\u2019t need to categorize numbers into \u2018int\u2019, \u2018short\u2019, or \u2018double\u2019 data types, like other coding languages. This makes the performance of operations and functions on this framework more intuitive compared to other options. You can see example code for PyTorch here.\n\nThe highlight of this framework, though, is that it offers developers the ability to use dynamic graphs. Tensorflow, Theano, and their derivatives allow you to create only static graphs, so you have to define the whole graph for the model before you can run it. However, in Pytorch, you can define or adjust your graph during runtime, so it\u2019s more flexible and allows you to use variable length inputs, especially in your RNNs. The framework also provides strong support for GPU acceleration, so you get both efficiency and speed. The main drawback to Pytorch, though, is that the framework is still growing and you may encounter some bugs. Moreover, owing to its younger age, the resources to supplement its official documentation are still quite scant. But looking at overall trends, this will not be a problem for too long, as more and more developers are converting to Pytorch and the community is growing slowly but steadily.\n\n1. Tensorflow\n\nIdeal for: Intermediate-level developers and for developing production models that need to quickly process vast data sets\n\nTensorflow is currently hailed as the best ML framework out there. Within a very short time, it has become a favorite for many developers and is witnessing an ever-growing community and extraordinary development momentum. The framework was developed by the Google Brain team and supports all platforms, from Linux to Android. It is a high-level framework that allows you to run low-level code with supporting libraries. Ultimately, it allows you to monitor the progress of the training process, while tracking a lot of metrics and not having to bother about most of the other details.\n\nStrengths:\n\nFlexibility\n\nContains several ready-to-use ML models and ready-to-run application packages\n\nScalability with hardware and software\n\nLarge online community\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nSupports only NVIDIA GPUs\n\nA slightly steep learning curve\n\nTensorflow\u2019s architecture and UX are different from other frameworks in that the nodes in a Tensorflow graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges of the graph represent multidimensional arrays (tensors). These tensors flow between the nodes, giving you a lot of flexibility when it comes to creating new nodes, unlike the Caffe architecture, for example. The system also has a host of models to choose from: the framework is pre-loaded with packages that let you perform voice recognition and machine translation, and models that let you run regressions, classifications, neural networks and an assortment of other algorithms. Tensorflow can be used for quite a few applications within machine learning. Check out a basic \u201cHello, World\u201d program here and a more traditional matrix example here.\n\nBut the feature that really takes the cake is Tensorflow\u2019s computing capabilities. To date, Tensorflow is the strongest contender in the distributed processing arena. It provides remarkable scalability and lets you deploy your computations to multiple CPUs, GPUs, other servers, mobile devices, and the Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine. You can do this without having to rewrite any code \u2014 that\u2019s truly powerful. The main downside, though, is that at the moment, it only supports NVIDIA GPUs. Also, when it comes to RNN support, it is ultimately weaker than some other frameworks and the learning curve can be a little steeper than Sci-kit and Pytorch. Overall, with a strong Google backing and a huge online community, Tensorflow is here for the long haul.\n\nConclusions\n\nTo sum up, while Tensorflow has gained enormous popularity owing to its flexibility and distributed processing capabilities, Pytorch is also slowly gaining momentum owing to its flatter learning curve and ability to process dynamic graphs. Both of these frameworks are multi-purpose and can be applied to many types of projects. Other frameworks like Caffe, Theano, and Sci-Kit Learn are more specialized and aimed toward specific tasks.\n\nNonetheless, machine learning and artificial intelligence are the future and these open source frameworks have brought ML to the grasp of any developer with a really keen interest. These libraries provide the tools for any Pythonista to practice machine learning principles. Pick a framework that meets your level of expertise and application domain and try out your first project!\n\nThis post is a part of Kite\u2019s new series on Python.

        "title": "5 Hats You Need to Wear to Crush Your Entrepreneurial Goals",
        "text": "5 Hats You Need to Wear to Crush Your Entrepreneurial Goals\n\nFocusing too intently might be ruining your productivity.\n\nPhoto by Austin Distel on Unsplash\n\nLet\u2019s be real y\u2019all \u2014 being an entrepreneur isn\u2019t always what it\u2019s cracked up to be. As Thomas Frank pointed out in his recent YouTube video, 5 Things I\u2019d Tell My 19-Year-Old Self About Running a Business, every entrepreneur has to wear several hats. Whether that\u2019s shifting between creative and managerial tasks, or something completely different, every business owner/entrepreneur/self-employed individual different modes of working.\n\nAfter recently starting a blog, I\u2019ve felt this on all sides. Not only are we responsible for the upkeep and layout of our website, but we\u2019re also responsible for managing our social media, responding to people\u2019s questions and comments, and let\u2019s not forget actually writing the blog.\n\n\u201cmode\u201d, noun, a way or manner in which something occurs or is experienced, expressed, or done.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is that we try to shift through different modes on purpose. This list of the five modes of entrepreneurship is meant to help you do that. It\u2019s meant not only to remind you of your responsibilities towards yourself and your business but of the different modes, you have the opportunity to flip between to be the most effective and happy.\n\n1. The exploration hat\n\nThe exploration mode is the mode that every future entrepreneur goes through before they even decide what they\u2019re going to try doing with their life. In the exploration mode, an individual will think of ideas. They\u2019ll lay down before they fall asleep every night and think about all of the things they want to do, all of the places they want to go, the person they want to be and the things they want to create.\n\n\u201cexplore\u201d, verb, inquire into or discuss (a subject or issue) in detail.\n\nIn the exploration mode, the creator must let themself think and dream and feel without a filter. You must not control what is going through or prevent something from passing through your mind. Anything goes. Let it through, let it pass, or let it stick. Don\u2019t lock yourself down on a particular idea \u2014 open yourself up to a vast array of possibilities.\n\nFor my own business and entrepreneurial pursuits, I\u2019ll often put this down in my calendar as \u201ctinkering time\u201d. This is what Barbara Oakley, author of A Mind For Numbers, refers to as diffused thinking, as opposed to the productive focused thinking. Exploration mode is where it all begins \u2014 which kind of makes it the most important. If it\u2019s not where you start, if it\u2019s not where you begin, then everything you produce can still be good, but it will miss a key ingredient \u2014 unbridled creativity.\n\n2. The brainstorming hat\n\nNow you have your ideas. Once you have your ideas, your unbridled and unfiltered list of things you\u2019ve come up with, you have to get into actionable steps. Now that you\u2019ve decided what your options are, you have to pick something. The brainstorming mode isn\u2019t as much of a creative process, but a revisionary process. Once you have your ideas, you have to decide which you are going to use in your life/business/etc.\n\nWhether it be throwing your ideas out on Reddit (my favorite pass-time) and waiting for feedback or talking with a few friends on Skype, get your ideas out into the world in a brainstorming and experiential way.\n\n\u201cbrainstorming\u201d, noun, group discussion to produce ideas or solve problems.\n\nBut, as you can see in the definition of brainstorming brought to us by Google, brainstorming is about more than just yourself. When you have a brainstorm, you have to have a whirlwind of brains, plural. We often mistake brainstorming for sitting in our room by ourselves \u2014 but that\u2019s just thinking, maybe it\u2019s idea generation.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.\u201d \u2014 Maya Angelou\n\nTo truly brainstorm, you have to work with other people. Whether it be throwing your ideas out on Reddit and waiting for feedback or talking with a few friends on Skype, get your ideas out into the world in a brainstorming and experiential way. I\u2019ve talked with friends over the phone, co-workers over Zoom, and family at the dining table and come up with more ideas than I ever could on my own. When you have your idea and are ready to get to work, don\u2019t forget to bring your crew together and get some ideas.\n\nThis is also the mode where you\u2019re researching, reading articles, books, etc. on what you\u2019re looking into as a potential idea to proceed on. And if you don\u2019t have anybody to brainstorm with about your ideas, write a letter to yourself. In brainstorming mode, your mind is testing out ideas, deciding how to proceed.\n\n3. The monk hat\n\nMonk mode is the third mode and it builds off of the results of your two previous modes. Once you have your ideas, and once you\u2019ve filtered those ideas through your mind and the minds of others, you have to apply them to your life and your model of business.\n\n\u201cA monk may be a person who decides to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his or her life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.\u201d (\u201cMonk\u201d, from Wikipedia)\n\nIn her TED talk, \u201cWant to be more creative? Go for a walk\u201d, Marilly Oppezzo talks about something called \u201cappropriate novelty\u201d. Creative ideas can come from anywhere, but they must be practical.\n\n\u201cMonk mode will increase your resilience and independence. If you were able to cut people and pastimes from your life, what does it say about you?\u201d \u2014 Lucio Buffalmano\n\nThe monk mode of the entrepreneur\u2019s creative process is the most spiritual and introspective of the modes. In the monk mode, an artist is focused on what is most important for their life, mission, and goals right now. I write often about my commitments list, but there\u2019s another thing that I use to postpone my goals and dreams. I have a chart with a timeline for the next eleven years of my life.\n\n\u201cI plan to live a few months in San Diego, I plan to pursue a certain career, I want to join a climbing gym. These three goals, among the dozens of other goals I have in this chart and in my head, are no less real or exciting to me as those I\u2019m pursuing now. They\u2019re simply not those I\u2019m ready to pursue. I have intuited and factually know that the time is not right.\u201d (From my 2019 personal journal)\n\nI figured that out in monk mode. Monk mode is when we can journal, when we can process where we are, get in touch with how we\u2019re feeling and who we need to be, and what we need to be pursuing to keep ourselves interested and passionate about the work that we\u2019re doing.\n\n4. The grinding/working hat\n\nNow you\u2019ve thought of ideas, you\u2019ve filtered the ideas, and you\u2019ve ideologically processed them, now you\u2019re ready to work through those tasks \u2014 and once you\u2019re done, you\u2019re going to see the results. This is often our least favorite mode, but it can be one of the most important ones. It becomes especially productive when you invite creativity into it. [\u201cgrind\u201d, noun, hard dull work.]\n\n\u201cGreatness is sifted through the grind, therefore don\u2019t despise the hard work now for surely it will be worth it in the end.\u201d \u2015 Sanjo Jendayi\n\nThis is that 4-hour block of time you\u2019ll spend designing your website or the 10-hour day you\u2019ll spend rounding up a list of clients who might actually be willing to speak to you. It\u2019s the weekend you spend in constant writing mode, or the endless research hole you go down into for your next piece.\n\nThis is where the real work happens \u2014 and you\u2019re prepared for it. Don\u2019t forget to grind. Otherwise, everything else you\u2019ve done in preparation for your work is kind of a moot point. This is where I will put about a five-hour block of time into my calendar where I\u2019ll go either to a quiet coffee shop, the library or somewhere else I know I won\u2019t be disturbed.\n\n5. The executing hat\n\nIn this mode, you have to use your executive functions to say \u201cyes\u201d to the things you need to say \u201cyes\u201d to and \u201cno\u201d to the things that you need to prevent from cluttering your schedule at the current time in your career path/year/etc. [\u201cexecute\u201d, verb, carry out, or put into effect (a plan, order, or course of action).]\n\nExecuting mode is all about taking your ideas that align with your current stage of life and your current goals, and making them happen. In executing mode, you\u2019re emailing people, you\u2019re making phone calls, you\u2019re filling out your calendar, creating a clear and actionable task list, and preparing to sit down and work.\n\nNot only are we responsible for the upkeep and layout of our website, but we\u2019re also responsible for managing our social media, responding to people\u2019s questions and comments, and let\u2019s not forget actually writing the blog.\n\nFor me, executing mode is when I\u2019m finally able to check off my task. It\u2019s where I finally hit send on the email, or add the meeting I wanted to schedule to my calendar, buy the product/membership, and more.\n\nExecution mode is all about getting balls rolling, whether that be planning for you to do the work or delegating to someone else. This is where stuff gets done. Save this mode for when you\u2019re brave enough to really do something. This is when you buy the domain name, publish the blog, outline the next post. When you finish in this mode, the task is complete, the plan has been executed, and it\u2019s time to move onto the next amazing project.",

        "title": "What's Happening When Your Sleepy Body Starts to Jerk",
        "text": "Why Your Body Sometimes Jerks As You Fall Asleep\n\nA closer look at hypnic jerks\n\nImages by the author (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nAhh\u2026 sleep. How nice. You turn off the lights. You close your weary eyes. You sigh. You relax. Your breathing slows down. Your mind begins to wander off, fading into the nightly oblivion.\n\nThen\u2026\n\nYou stumble, trip, fall. Your body jolts. Your leg kicks. Your heart pounds. Huh? What happened? Did you mistakenly fall asleep on a trapdoor?\n\nNope. You simply experienced a hypnic jerk.\n\nWhat\u2019s a hypnic jerk?\n\nA hypnic jerk, or sleep start, is a phenomenon that occurs when your body transitions from wakefulness to sleep. It involves a sudden involuntary muscle twitch and is frequently accompanied by a falling or tripping sensation. It\u2019s that strange muscle spasm that happens when you\u2019re lying in bed, trying to sleep, and are suddenly jolted awake because you feel like you stumbled over something.\n\nHypnic jerks are common and benign.\n\nBut what causes them? Well, no one really knows. It\u2019s still a mystery. However, researchers have come up with several hypotheses that may explain them, with the following two being the most popular.\n\nHypothesis 1: Your body twitches as daytime motor control is overridden by sleep paralysis\n\nHow is it that a bedfellow of yours doesn\u2019t wake up pummeled and bruised if you have a dream about a boxing match? Is it because they\u2019re having a complementary dream where they\u2019re blocking all your jabs, hooks, and other punches?\n\nNope. The person sharing the bed with you doesn\u2019t get pummeled because when you\u2019re asleep, your body is paralyzed. This is due to something called REM sleep atonia, which prevents you from acting out your dreams.\n\nREM atonia works by inhibiting your motor neurons. It does so by raising the bar on the amount of electricity the brain must send down a motor neuron to trigger a movement. So, for instance, the little bit of electricity that your brain sends to your finger to make it move when you\u2019re awake is no longer enough when you\u2019re under REM atonia.\n\nWhen you\u2019re asleep, your body is paralyzed. This is due to something called REM sleep atonia, which prevents you from acting out your dreams.\n\nNow, the thing is that there is no single on/off switch in your body that inhibits all your motor neurons at once. Instead, the subsystems of your brain that handle sleep need to wrestle control from the subsystems that handle wakefulness. And sometimes, during this wrestling match, some motor neurons are fired randomly, causing your body to twitch.\n\nHypothesis 2: Your brain thinks you\u2019re a monkey falling off a tree\n\nImage modified by the author. Illustration source: Alessandro D\u2019Antonio/Unsplash\n\nImagine you\u2019re a monkey and the last rays of sunlight have just disappeared behind the green forest canopy. It\u2019s getting dark, and you say to yourself: time for sleep. Your brain begins to ooze some melatonin into your bloodstream and you yawn. Drowsy, you settle down on a comfortable tree branch.\n\nYour eyelids become heavy and your breathing slows. The outside world begins to fade. Sounds become distant.\n\nAt this point, the subconscious part of your brain takes over. \u201cPerfect,\u201d it says, \u201ctime to boot up the dream images.\u201d Your brain initiates the dream procedure, and just when you\u2019re about to nod off completely, it notices that all your muscles have suddenly and unexpectedly relaxed. \u201cHoly Banana!\u201d your brain screams panic-stricken, \u201cMayday! Mayday! We\u2019re in freefall! Dammit! Wake up! Wake up! Shit, crap! Brace for impaaaact!\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re probably aware, we humans descend from primates who lived and slept on trees. This means that we\u2019ve inherited some monkey brain routines that no longer serve any purpose. Among them, according to the monkey-fall hypothesis, is a reflex that jolts you awake when you\u2019re falling from a tree.\n\nYou see, when a monkey is unexpectedly soaring through the air, its muscles no longer have to prop it up and so they go limp. Confusingly, however, your muscles also go limp when you\u2019re sleeping.\n\nSo, when you drift off into sleep and your muscles relax a little too fast, your groggy brain sometimes misinterprets this for falling off a tree. As a result, your brain freaks out and triggers a reflex that startles you awake in an attempt to prepare for an imminent crash onto the forest floor. Little does your brain know, in its sleepy state\u2014and that you no longer live in trees.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear either way\n\nHypnic jerks are involuntary muscle contractions that occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. They\u2019re most likely to occur if you\u2019ve been gulping down too much coffee, have been stressed or sleep-deprived, or did some vigorous exercise before going to bed. About 70% of people have experienced them. Even so, they are not well understood.\n\nEither way, hypnic jerks are benign and nothing to worry about. The worst that can happen is probably an occasional kick against the shin of whoever is sharing the bed with you.",

        "title": "What is Content Marketing?",
        "text": "How is content marketing different from traditional advertising?\n\nWhat most people find difficult to understand about content marketing is how it differs from traditional advertising. After all, if \u201ccontent is king,\u201d what have companies been marketing with all these years?\n\nTraditional advertising is interruptive and allows marketers to push out their message in front of their audience \u2014 regardless of whether or not they want to see it. Traditional advertising rushes at consumers in the form of newspaper ads, magazine ads, billboards, radio ads, television ads, and direct mailings.\n\nOn the other hand, content marketing is much more subtle. This marketing is entertaining and educational. It draws in customers through storytelling, articles, blog posts, newsletters, emails, quizzes, infographics, videos, and podcasts. Content marketing offers consumers value and thereby makes them appreciate your company\u2019s existence. You\u2019re not advertising directly to your customers. You\u2019re offering them something in your marketing that helps them feel connected to your brand.\n\nContent marketing also excels through avenues like a company or outside blog, social media sites, YouTube, and online articles. These formats have only become more available in the past two decades, and companies are taking advantage of them.\n\nThere are a few other ways that you may distinguish content marketing from traditional advertising:\n\nShort-term v. Long-term\n\nTraditional advertising operated on the idea that a customer would see the ad and be enticed to buy the product immediately. But\u2026who actually does this? Conversely, content marketing doesn\u2019t worry about selling a product each and every time they get in front of their customer. Companies who focus on this strategy know that the best way to their customers\u2019 wallets is by providing valuable content.\n\nTalking to v. Talking with\n\nTraditional advertising talks to customers. There\u2019s no dialogue or relationship. It\u2019s just a litany of benefits of a product or service. Content marketing, especially on social media, allows customers to respond, engage, interact, and get involved. You can gauge interest in certain topics or ask for feedback on new ideas. It allows you to cater your marketing and campaigns to your audience instead of telling them what you think they want you to hear.\n\nShowing v. Nurturing\n\nA great example of traditional advertising is a car dealership commercial. Within seconds, you know all about the business and product that is being sold to you. The person on the screen is talking at you, telling you what you could have, and showing you the price tag for it.\n\nContent marketing is the opposite. It\u2019s a slower process, and it targets customers who have an interest in your industry. By producing content that they find useful or interesting, you create and nurture a relationship with them. You provide value and keep them coming back.\n\nGeneral v. Targeted\n\nTraditional advertising is about getting your message in front of as many people as possible. Content marketing targets a specific group of individuals. Before putting out a content marketing campaign, businesses will research that specific audience and look at trends that do well among that group. The more they know about them, the greater chance they have of boosting engagement, getting new sales, developing customer loyalty, and more!",

        "title": "How To Be Productive and Effective During Social Distancing",
        "text": "How To Be Productive and Effective During Social Distancing\n\nUse this time to be effective and learn more\n\nYesterday, I sent out an email to my subscribers, seeing if everyone was safe during the current Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nI got an interesting response from one reader:\n\n\u201cI used to sometimes wish the world would just stop spinning for a bit so I could read that book, learn that skill, re-assess that career. Like a snow-day for the whole world.\u201d\n\nThat struck me. How many of us have wished for the same thing \u2014 a sudden break from our job so we could just sit down, re-assess, and reflect?\n\nThe world has been shaken by the Coronavirus. As healthcare professionals heroically work around the clock to save lives and treat sick people, many of us have found ourselves stuck at home, without work, sports, events, or gathering of any kind to pass the time.\n\nMany people are turning to television, video games, or social media. While it\u2019s important to be informed, this is a unique chance for many of us to finally do things we\u2019ve always been \u201cmeaning\u201d to do. It\u2019s time to reflect and use this time wisely.\n\nHere\u2019s how to be productive and fruitful during social distancing, to help yourself, your family, and those around you.\n\nReinvest Your Free Time\n\n\u201cAnyone who truly makes something of themselves takes their free time and reinvests it in themselves.\u201d -Nicolas Cole\n\nMost people actually don\u2019t reinvest their free time.\n\nAccording to a 2016 American Time Use Survey, most Americans spend 2.7 hours after work watching television \u2014 about half their free time.\n\nNearly a third of people didn\u2019t touch a book in the past year.\n\nLess than 5% of adults exercise for 30 minutes or more a day.\n\nWhile you\u2019re social distancing and quarantining yourself, it\u2019s tempting to grab some snacks, plop on the couch, and binge watch everything.\n\nInstead, reinvest this free time on productive, edifying behaviors that will make you smarter and more skilled.\n\nThe world\u2019s most successful people invest their free time. In the words of prolific writer Nicolas Cole:\n\n\u201cSuccessful people don\u2019t see it as \u2018free time,\u2019 they see it as the only time they have to do the things they really want to do in life \u2014 and they don\u2019t take a minute for granted.\u201d\n\nScott Adams, creator of the wildly successful Dilbert comics, once said, \u201cEvery skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.\u201d\n\nIf you want to be successful, and focus your efforts to achieve greatness in the most important areas of your life, it\u2019s fair to ask yourself:\n\nHow do you usually spend your free time?\n\nWhat new skills can you learn right now?\n\nWhat activities drain your energy and leave you lifeless?\n\nWhat can you do differently?\n\nIs excessive consumption of social media, the news, television, and video games preventing you from achieving your goals?\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, I hope you\u2019re healthy and safe during the Coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s fine to watch TV and take your mind off the terrible news.\n\nBut spend more time learning and creating than you do on entertainment. Maybe you haven\u2019t read a book in forever. When\u2019s the last time you took an online course? Exercise! (If you have the space).\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long social distancing is needed; in the meantime, choose to reinvest your free time to make your life better.\n\nDevelop Your Ability to Ignore Almost Everything\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of distractions right now.\n\nWhen I woke up this morning, I had to fight the urge to immediately check my phone and the news. I decided to give myself a good 20 minutes to make my coffee, feed the dog, and sit down before I checked the Internet.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to stay informed, there\u2019s no point in torturing yourself over things you can\u2019t control. Learn what you need to know, then focus on other things.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing the Coronavirus is teaching us, it\u2019s that most things are unimportant. Family, loved ones, your health, helping people \u2014 these are truly important things. Everything else is secondary.\n\nMost things, frankly, don\u2019t deserve our full attention and focus.\n\nWhat I define as \u201cimportant\u201d is simple: does it contribute to expanding your life? Does it help those around you? Does it directly build your legacy and life\u2019s calling? Does it give you life and fulfillment?\n\nFor me, the most important things for me are Jesus, family, my health, and my work. Everything else simply comes second.\n\nOf course, anything can be construed to fit these requirements; people will claim email is \u201cessential.\u201d Watching that TV show is a \u201cmust-see.\u201d\n\nBut when you really, truly analyze these \u201cessential\u201d and \u201ccrucial\u201d obligations, you realize they have virtually no impact on your future. They don\u2019t expand your life. They don\u2019t contribute to your legacy.\n\nThe more you understand this, the better equipped you are to produce truly phenomenal work and help those around you.\n\nWhat \u201cessential\u201d things do you need to give up?\n\nWhat do you need to start ignoring?\n\nHow can you spend that time better?\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you started these things yet?\n\nYour ability to ignore irrelevance is just as important as your ability to focus on priorities.\n\n\u201cBeing perpetually busy is a kind of laziness.\u201d -Tim Ferriss\n\nSpend More Time Learning and Creating Than On Entertainment and Distractions\n\nA couple weeks ago, I bought an online course on building a business.\n\nIt\u2019s been weird studying marketing habits and sales letters while the world around me seems to be crumbling with the Coronavirus. I feel very distracted and unfocused.\n\nBut I\u2019m glad I\u2019m doing something to help my business and my family while I\u2019m stuck at home.\n\nI definitely plan on spending some time playing video games and relaxing. There\u2019s a lot going on, and it feels overwhelming and horrible.\n\nBut I\u2019m choosing to spend more time learning and creating things than I do on entertainment.\n\nIf you want to live an extraordinary life, you need to give up a \u201cnormal\u201d one. It\u2019s normal to spend all your free time on TV and bingeing on more news stories about the virus. It\u2019s normal to want to panic and buy all the toilet paper within a 2 mile radius!\n\nAgain, it\u2019s important to stay informed \u2014 I recommend listening to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO) for legitimate, fact-based updates.\n\nBut if you want to be productive and fruitful during social distancing, spend less time worrying about the news and more time learning new things, reading more uplifting content, and practicing new skills.\n\nThere are probably dozens of things people have started doing on a daily basis that aren\u2019t helping them improve. Don\u2019t be like these people; choose to help others and improve your own life by expanding your knowledge, modeling this behavior for others.\n\nSpend more time on learning and creating.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nIt\u2019s a scary time right now.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to panic, and do things out of fear.\n\nBut instead of letting fear dominate your life and decisions, choose to be productive and fruitful during this required social distancing. While everyone\u2019s wringing their hands watching the news and rushing to buy more supplies (when they already have plenty), choose to be productive and fruitful.\n\nSpend more time learning and creating than you do on entertainment and distraction.\n\nBe informed, but don\u2019t torture yourself by constantly checking the news every few minutes.\n\nFocus on being a more calm, resilient, patient person in the face of uncertainty and fear. Be someone people can look to and lean on during this time.\n\nBe effective, be helpful, and be someone you\u2019re proud to be.\n\nStay safe out there.\n\nReady To Level-Up?\n\nIf you want to become extraordinary and become 10x more effective than you were before, check out my checklist.\n\nClick here to get the checklist now!",

Instagram subtly lets you know if someone you\u2019re following follows you as well.\n\nWhile Medium does display a list of followers and people you follow, you may wonder how you can retrieve a list of \u201cmutual connections\u201d \u2014a term I\u2019m using users who are following each other (analogous to Facebook friends).\n\nThe boring, tedious, and time-consuming way to find mutual connections is to look through your ever-growing list of followers, hoping to stumble across those green ticks (or black if you\u2019re on a web browser). But this won\u2019t be easy if you\u2019re browsing through someone else\u2019s profile \u2014 you have to note down the people who are common to the followers and followings lists of a Medium user.\n\nLuckily, you can save yourself some effort and automate these tasks with a small piece of code. Best of all, you don\u2019t need to be a programmer to understand how it works or run the program.\n\nThe logic we\u2019re going to use is based on that fun concept we all learned at high school \u2014 Venn-diagrams.\n\nHere\u2019s an illustration of how to find your mutual connections on Medium:\n\nTo put this Venn diagram into action, we\u2019ve already written a script in Python (a popular programming language) that pings a URL. In return, we get a list of followers and following of that Medium user.\n\nBy using the fundamentals of sets, we create an intersection of followers and following and export the mutual connections list to a CSV file.

        "title": "4 Quotes by Carlos Ruiz Zafon to Make You a Better Writer",
        "text": "Carlos Ruiz Zafon (born in 1964) is the author of multiple beloved novels, including The Shadow of the Wind and The Labyrinth of Spirits.\n\nHere are four of his wonderful quotes to inspire your writing!\n\n1. I realized that I had always been writing things that other people wanted me to write and not what I really wanted to write, so I felt like I was losing my way.\n\nMany of us need a few years to find our voice as a writer. Many of us need a few years to stop pretending to be like other authors we adore and instead write the stories we really want to write. And it can be especially disheartening when you\u2019re writing things other people want you to be doing instead of what you want to be doing. There will be friends and family members and teachers who try to guide your writing, but as soon as they start pressuring you to write a certain kind of project you\u2019re not interested in or passionate about, you have to resist that pressure as much as possible.\n\nWriting is hard, and it\u2019s made about twenty times harder when you\u2019re hard at work at something you don\u2019t want to do. It\u2019s why millions of younger people struggle year after year with having to write that essay for class the next day they have zero interest in. When you\u2019re faced with that scary blank page, and you\u2019re being forced to write something when you\u2019d rather do literally anything else, there\u2019s pretty much nothing worse. So write what you want to write. Ignore those other people and stop the kind of work that\u2019s been trying for you and lean into the stories that compel you and excite you, always.\n\n2. My work as a screenwriter has influenced my fiction. Writing screenplays forces you to consider many elements regarding story structure and other narrative devices that can be used to enhance the infinitely more complex demands of a novel.\n\nNovels and screenplays are vastly different beasts. In a novel you have more freedom to do what you want in terms of point-of-view and scene length and character interiority. You can write the novel super lean and have it almost look like a screenplay in a sense, and you can fill up your novel with giant block paragraphs and dozens of pages without any dialogue. You can pretty much do whatever you want in that form of writing, while screenwriting has a lot more rules you need to abide by. You can\u2019t write scenes that go on for ten pages. You have to write some dialogue here and there. Everything you write will need to be seen in visual form, and you can never forget that.\n\nBut despite all those rules, I agree with Zafon that it\u2019s in your best interest to at least learn about screenwriting, if not write a screenplay of your own. It\u2019s a really great exercise to learn how to tell your stories actually, because you discover what needs to be there and what can go. You don\u2019t have room to do everything you want. There are only so many pages you get to work with, and you have to make each one of them count. You want to think this way about your novels, too. You don\u2019t want to write 600 pages just because you can. You don\u2019t want chapter seventeen to have thirty block paragraphs and go on forever just because it can.\n\nStudy screenplays to learn how to tell your stories more visually and more concisely and try writing one at some point to see what happens. I promise you\u2019ll learn a hell of a lot!\n\n3. I am a curious creature and put my finger in as many cakes as I can: history, film, technology, etc. I\u2019m also a freak for urban history, particularly Barcelona, Paris and New York. I know more weird stuff about 19th-century Manhattan than is probably healthy.\n\nHere\u2019s something to keep in mind as you grow your career as a fiction writer \u2014 the more curious you are about the world, and the weirder stuff you learn and pay attention to, the better your writing will be in the long run. You don\u2019t want to just read novels in the genre you write in and watch movies of the genre you write in and then write in that genre. Your work will get stale after awhile. You\u2019ll begin to repeat yourself.\n\nTo improve upon your skills, and to bring better ideas to the page year after year, it\u2019s in your best interest to study new things that broaden your horizon. You want to be curious about history, film, technology. You want to read non-fiction books about subjects that you know little or nothing about. When you do so, you are not wasting your time, I promise. Even just one nugget from that non-fiction book you\u2019re reading could inspire a new novel idea. It could bring you something that completely changes the trajectory of your writing career.\n\n4. I\u2019m a voracious reader, and I like to explore all sorts of writing without prejudice and without paying any attention to labels, conventions or silly critical fads.\n\nSo many successful authors have said it, so I hope you\u2019ve learned by now one of the best things you can do as a writer. Yes, you want to read. And not just read the things you\u2019re interested in, not just read the authors who you\u2019ve adored for years. If you want to have a thriving career as a writer, it\u2019s in your best interest to get your hands on all sorts of books and read voraciously.\n\nRead stuff that fascinates you and read stuff that doesn\u2019t necessarily fascinate you. Read that book that bores you and ask yourself why. Study the sentences. Study how the story is laid out. What doesn\u2019t work about it? How could you improve upon it? Sometimes I find reading something I don\u2019t like very much even more inspiring than reading a great work of art. I might enjoy the great work of art more, but by the time I reach the end, I might feel like my writing is inadequate. That if I lived another 1,000 years, I\u2019d never be able to write something as good, and that can sometimes stifle my creativity.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important of all is to do what Zafon says: explore all sorts of writing without prejudice, without paying attention to things like labels and author names and book covers and fads. Don\u2019t read the book everyone else is reading. Find that new book few people know about. Dip into an old classic that\u2019s not really discussed anymore.\n\nRead as many books as you can, and your writing will improve year after year, I guarantee it!",

        "text": "I just finished planning out all 31 of my Blog-Your-Own-Book project posts. Whew.\n\nIt took me a couple of hours to think of the story, subheads, take-away, and an opt-in for each of the posts I\u2019d picked for my project, but the results will be worth it. I\u2019ll be able to write them so much faster and easier in August.\n\nAnd I know I have a whole book\u2019s worth of things to say on my topic.\n\nScreenshot: Author\n\nThe writing part of BYOB starts tomorrow (August 1.) Are you ready for this?\n\nThere are a few things that I want you to know. Think of it as last-minute flight instructions. These things will help you make sure to have fun, actually finish your book, and build your audience while you\u2019re doing it.\n\nThink About Your Project as a Whole\n\nAs I was planning out all of my posts today, I had an idea. If I create worksheets to use as my opt-in for most of the posts, then I\u2019d have a workbook at the end that I can either include with my finished BYOB book or use as a lead magnet.\n\nYou know: maybe a link in the book to a landing page where someone could download a PDF of all the worksheets. So they get on my email list and they get this workbook that I\u2019ve created.\n\nYour BYOB project is more than just a collection of blog posts. It\u2019s a book. A whole project in its own right. It will help you to see all of the posts in one place, so that you can see how they fit together and where you might work to expand or make your project better.\n\nThink About Your Reader\n\nWho are you writing this book for? I can\u2019t emphasize enough how important it is to know that.\n\nHint: You\u2019re not creating it for everybody. I mean, sure. Everybody who wants to can read it. But you really need to know who exactly you\u2019re writing for. Because that person (those people!) will come find you if you create something for them.\n\nMy project is about creating a writing habit. My reader is a writer who wants to write more, but struggles with time management and prioritizing writing in their life.\n\nWho is your reader?\n\nPick a Good Title, Subtitle, and Photo for Every Post\n\nLet\u2019s think about a couple of important things for your actual posts.\n\nEvery single one should have a nice, clear, simple title. Think \u2018newspaper headline\u2019 not \u2018clever writer title.\u2019 You should be able to tell someone what your title is, and have them be able to tell you what your post will be about.\n\nReally. That\u2019s an exercise you can try.\n\nYou should also have a subtitle that lets your reader know a little more about what to expect. It can be a little more clever, but should still be clear and simple.\n\nAnd then choose a photo that adds something to the post. You don\u2019t have to go crazy here, but remember that all your reader sees before they decided to click on your post is the photo, the title, and the subtitle. So the three of them should work together.\n\nBe Sure You\u2019re Set Up for Capturing Your Audience\n\nHere are the ways that I\u2019m going to work toward capturing my audience for my BYOB project.\n\nToday, in my Write Brain publication, I set up a tab for my BYOB project. And a feature page to hold the posts. You can see how to do that yourself here.\n\nIn a pinned post on the feature page, I have an introductory post I wrote today. And on that page, I have a link to a landing page, where readers can sign up to get daily notification in August of my posts.\n\nYou can see that feature page here.\n\nI\u2019m also creating an opt-in for every post in August, or using one I\u2019ve already created if it fits.\n\nThe goal with this project is to start building an audience while you write the book. This is how you do it.\n\nSo. Are you ready?\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ve come up with for your BYOB project!\n\nUse the hashtag #NinjaBYOB on social media and NinjaBYOB as a tag on your posts here, so we can all find each other.\n\nWe\u2019re hosting daily write-ins in August if you want some support while you\u2019re working on your project. You can get access to those by clicking here and signing up for a free month of the Ninja Writers Club.",

        "title": "These Stacked Habits Helped Me Build a Six-Figure Writing Business",
        "text": "I have a bunch of little habits surrounding writing.\n\nBy little, I mean \u2014 ridiculously small.\n\nSo small that I feel like they hardly qualify as habits. Except they do. Because when I do them every single day, they add up to a writing career. A good, solid career that is something I could barely have dreamed about five years ago.\n\nThis is my writing career:\n\nI am a traditionally published novelist.\n\nI\u2019m one of Medium\u2019s top bloggers.\n\nI run the coolest online writing community there is. (Seriously. The coolest.)\n\nI have an incredible team working with me.\n\nMost important: I haven\u2019t had to have a soul-sucking day job in five years.\n\nI work a lot. Basically, I work all the time, if I\u2019m honest. I love my work. It\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life. But the foundation of my work is this collection of little habits that stack up together to make something bigger than the sum of their parts.\n\nMy Habits\n\nI write new words on my work-in-progress novel for 10 minutes a day.\n\nI write those words first thing in the morning.\n\nI make a note to myself about tomorrow\u2019s scene when I\u2019m done today.\n\nI plan my week every Sunday night.\n\nI plan seven blog posts every Sunday night.\n\nI check in with each one of my team members individually at least once a week.\n\nI come up with ten new ideas every night.\n\nNone of my habits takes more than twenty minutes at a minimum. Some of them take more, because I have more time. For instance, I usually write for more than ten minutes a day on my novel.\n\nI also talk to my team members more than once a week, but this habit helps me make sure that I meet what feels like an important bare minimum to me.\n\nAnd like I said, looking at them, they don\u2019t look like much. But together, they\u2019ve been pretty powerful for me.\n\nThe best way I know to develop a habit is to attach it to a habit that you already have. For instance, I do my fiction writing as soon as I wake up, before I check my email (which is my habit first thing in the morning.) And I have stacked the habit of writing down what I\u2019m going to write tomorrow right after I\u2019m done writing for the morning.\n\nI do my Sunday night planning right after dinner. And I plan my blog posts right after my overall planning.\n\nI do my idea exercise (thanks James Altucher!) right after my last workshop of the night, at 10 p.m., on nights when I\u2019m working. One nights when I\u2019m not, I do it right after I\u2019m done with whatever work I am doing. It\u2019s my last work thing of the day.\n\nWhich habits do you want to create?\n\nThe first step is to create your own list of habits. Remember that they should be almost ridiculously small. These are minimums, not maximums. You aren\u2019t setting a timer and making yourself stop when it goes off.\n\nThink about your goals and consider what little habits would work you step-by-step toward them.\n\nI often come up with a new habit when there\u2019s something I want to work on. For instance, writing first thing in the morning is a habit I develop when I have a project that\u2019s difficult for me.\n\nWhat are your current set habits?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified your habits, see if they stack with each other. Like my fiction writing habits do.\n\nWrite for 10 minutes a day.\n\nWrite first thing in the morning.\n\nWrite down tomorrow\u2019s scene when I\u2019m done.\n\nSee? Pretty, right?\n\nNow, think about the habits you already have. Remember, you want really strong, no-brainer habits.\n\nI\u2019ve stacked my ten-ideas practice with the end of my workday. I\u2019m definitely in the habit of ending my workday eventually. My fiction writing is stacked with my most basic early-morning habit. My Sunday planning is stacked with dinner time.\n\nTry it for a week.\n\nChoose once of your new habits, stack it with one you\u2019ve already developed to the point of never having to think about it, and give it a go for a week.\n\nJust make a commitment to show up for your new habit every day for seven days. You might need to do something to remind yourself. Stick a sticky note somewhere you\u2019ll see it as soon as you\u2019re done with the habit you\u2019re stacking with.\n\nSet up what you need for your habit and keep it handy to the place you\u2019ll do that work. I have a lapdesk and my laptop computer right next to my bed, so it\u2019s super easy for me to just get to work right away.\n\nReward yourself in some way for a seven day streak. You\u2019re so awesome!\n\nTry it for a month.\n\nHow did that first week feel? If it felt pretty good, keep going. Turn it into a 30 day challenge.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling during that month, it\u2019s okay to see if there\u2019s some other habit that would be better to stack your new one with. The goal isn\u2019t to make yourself do something that doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s to figure out what does.\n\nTry it for a quarter.\n\nYou\u2019re on fire! Once you\u2019ve got your 30 day challenge under your belt \u2014 just keep going. Extend it to 90 days. You\u2019re already on a roll, so you might as well.\n\nIn my experience, 90 days is long enough to see huge results from your little habit. You can easily write 90 to 100 pages 10 minutes at a time in 90 days. You can develop your idea machine. You can create relationships. Seriously, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nAfter 90 days, chances are your habit will be set. You\u2019ll be used to following one habit with another and you won\u2019t have to spend too much time thinking about it.\n\nTry another one.\n\nGo back to your list and pick another habit and do it all over again. One week, one month, one quarter.\n\nYou can work on stacking more than one habit at a time, of course. I\u2019m in the middle of a quarter-streak of writing on my current WIP first thing in the morning. I already had the habit of writing ten minutes a day, but not always on fiction. And I wasn\u2019t writing when I woke up.\n\nYou could, I suppose, develop all your habits at first. Just know that if it feels overwhelming it\u2019s okay to slow down and just do one at a time. The goal is life-long habits. If it takes you a year or two to get them all in working order, that\u2019s not a big deal.",

        "title": "Use The 5/5/5 Rule To Unlock Your Focus And Build Up Discipline",
        "text": "Use The 5/5/5 Rule To Unlock Your Focus And Build Up Discipline\n\nFour powerful questions to help you improve your life\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Borba on Unsplash\n\nFeeling stuck? Maybe lacking focus? Need some more discipline in your life?\n\nI can help you out with that. And it won\u2019t take much time at all either.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can do it: perspective. Perspective is very powerful. It\u2019s probably one of the most powerful things you can ever give yourself. It\u2019s why you hire a coach or get a mentor to help you grow. They give you perspective that you cannot find on your own. Honestly, it\u2019s even why many people hire a counselor too. That and sometimes we don\u2019t trust ourselves fully.\n\nSo, what if you could unlock a new perspective just with a few simple questions? The good news is you can. Allow me to share with you something I call the 5/5/5 Rule. It\u2019s simple but also extremely powerful.\n\nEnter The Shockingly Simple 5/5/5 Rule\n\nI almost hesitate to call this a rule, but it really works. Just like the \u201cGolden Rule.\u201d It\u2019s a good guide that you can just apply and use to get some results. So, without further ado, the 5/5/5 Rule is based on these 3 simple questions:\n\nHow will you feel about something 5 minutes from now? How will you feel about something 5 months from now? How will you feel about something 5 years from now?\n\nYou can apply these questions to pretty much anything. I\u2019m going to use myself as example here, but I have a feeling I\u2019m not alone with these struggles. Before we start, a disclaimer of sorts: you have to be totally honest with yourself. No sugarcoating, no half-truths. You must really be willing to dig deep and even dive back into your past in order to have the answer that you need in order to move forward. Okay, back to our regularly scheduled programming. Let\u2019s look at a few examples of the 5/5/5 Rule in action.\n\n4 Examples Of The 5/5/5 Rule In Action\n\nFor example, you could ask\u2026 how will you feel 5 minutes from now if you eat that Oreo pie? Personally, I know I\u2019ll feel like a bear that got shot with a tranquilizer dart (or two.) Let\u2019s just say you won\u2019t want to around me. The only options are to eat more of the pie or to immediately take a nap.\n\nSo, the first question of the 5/5/5 Rule clearly tells me it\u2019s best to not eat any of the Oreo pie. If I slip up and eat one piece, I know that I need to stop myself there, or I\u2019m likely going to want more of the pie. The pattern has been established. I often rationalize and say, \u201cIt\u2019s a special occasion,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a small piece.\u201d But those are just excuses that enable me to eat more than I should. Yes, I\u2019m an Oreo pie addict of sorts. Some sweets just make me want more. If you struggle with sweets too, maybe you need to answer these same questions as well.\n\nHow will you feel if you go on Facebook 5 minutes from now? I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ll probably be distracted, annoyed, or envious. Anytime I have a very positive experience on Facebook it\u2019s almost always on Messenger, connecting with a human being directly. That tells me it would be a much better idea to text or call a friend directly (or just use messenger) instead of going on Facebook.\n\nHow will you feel five months from now if you work with that client you don\u2019t really trust? I\u2019ve actually done this one too. I share some of how that went right here. Spoiler alert: I busted my butt for about five months only to get fired without being told I was fired. I believe the proper term is \u201cbeing ghosted.\u201d Ouch. Thankfully, I learned a lot from the ordeal and grew a lot from the experience. Next time I don\u2019t trust a client, I\u2019m running the other way.\n\nHow will you feel about that new shiny toy or gadget you want 5 years from now? Before I answer this, please know I\u2019m not saying a new toy or gadget is a bad thing. I\u2019m just saying that 5 years from now gives you a lot of perspective. Will that item be in a box or a drawer? Will it still have any value at all? Some of the questions that pop up from the original question will help you decide if something is a good idea or maybe you should reconsider.\n\nWhen I focus on a new tool or tech gadget and it\u2019s almost always a bit of a distraction from the thing I really want to be doing. For example, I was convinced that I needed an iMac to get more writing done. The bigger screen would be good, and I\u2019d be more productive. But the reality is that was just a distraction. I bought an iPad so I could write on it. Turns out the iPad is not good for writing at all. I now ask myself these questions as much as possible with tech gadgets.\n\nYou might not know how you will feel about something 5 years from now. That\u2019s totally fair. There is something else you can try that you\u2019ll find very helpful. And it\u2019s just one super simple question that cuts through the fluff like a light saber.\n\nA Plan B Of Sorts\n\nI know that it is possible that a specific time frame might not answer your question. If that is the case, ask this: \u201cWhat would you tell your best friend in the same situation?\u201d\n\nPhoto by Brooke Cagle on Unsplash\n\nAny way you can help yourself think of the consequences \u2014 whether good, bad, or indifferent \u2014 will give you more clarity as you move forward.\n\nOftentimes we do things that we know do not make us feel good in hopes that somehow, magically, things will change and work in our favor. Social media comes to mind. But the reality is that the more you use social media, the more likely you are to struggle with depression and anxiety. If your friend comes to you and says, \u201cI\u2019m feeling anxious\u2026 often when I use Facebook. What do you recommend?\u201d What would you say? It\u2019s amazing how much clarity you can have when you use this simple approach.\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhen you combine the 5/5/5 Rule with the best friend question, you\u2019ve got some serious tools in your toolbox. You can build a fresh, new perspective. You\u2019ll suddenly have more clarity and focus. Don\u2019t settle for staying stuck. Spend a few minutes answering these tough questions, and then you\u2019ll be able to move forward.",

        "text": "Photo by Gabriel Crismariu on Unsplash\n\nAn underlying principle of programming or coding, is logic. Determining logic is in the combination of key words, variables, entities, to create a flow for a goal. A classic is Hello World, print(\u201cHello World\u201d), from Python resulting in a display of Hello World. Displaying a phrase in a command line is a very simple and rewarding goal. So are solving problems using classification and clustering for real world problems.\n\nClassification is categorization of where to place an object or device and most commonly supervised learning with labeled data. Example from Scikit-Learn for Random Forrest.\n\nClustering is a way to order data points by grouping together by similarity or proximity on a graph and usually unsupervised learning with unlabeled data. Example groups results together in three categories.\n\nTraining is a portion of dataset reserved for generating rules common in classification techniques like Random Forrest.\n\nTest is the selected dataset to use in generating a solution in classification or clustering.\n\nAlgorithms are apply to handle scalable datasets to apply learning to problem solving and hypothesis testing. The clustering was created using random generated data to show what the learning does. The machine will plot and then group by proximity forming a shape around data points. Random Tree is an algorithm that pares a test to a Boolean output branching like a tree finishing in a hypothesis test and suggested output.\n\nConclusion\n\nLogic is important to build cases for analysis in Machine Learning supervised or not supervised. This created solution to a puzzle by recognizing patterns and creating association in sequence for results that provide insight similar to finishing a puzzle by fitting pieces to gain a larger understanding based on data.",

        "text": "3 Simple Daily Creative Exercises Every Photographer Should do\n\nThe secret to creative success is found within your daily routine\n\nPhoto by Adam Frazier on Unsplash\n\nThey always say that success is found in your daily routine.\n\nThis backs up the belief that we must do something daily or almost daily for it to become a habit that leads us to success.\n\nThis is no different for photography.\n\nAs photographers, we all should try and do little things and habits every day to develop quicker and become more consistent with our creative lives.\n\nSometimes this can be hard if we have commitments or demanding jobs and as such, I have developed a quick list here of 3 simple creative exercises you can do, as a photographer, to improve your creativity skills.\n\nIf you are able to do one of these exercises on a daily or near-daily basis, you will be well on your way to growing as a photographer and your photos will become much better.\n\nPlay around with a new genre of photography you may not normally shoot\n\nPhoto by David Marcu on Unsplash\n\nAs a photographer, you may be used to shooting a certain type of photography.\n\nMaybe you love portrait photography and you are obsessed with taking pictures of people.\n\nMaybe you love interacting with the natural environment and you are eager to take endless pictures of animals and wildlife.\n\nThis is great!\n\nAs a photographer, it is important to make sure that you love taking the pictures that you are taking and that you are passionate about that type of photography.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that it will harm you to try out a new type of photography.\n\nBy doing this, you will expose yourself to a wider range of creative stimuli and you will grow both as a photographer and as a creator.\n\nYou may also realise that you love this new type of photography you discovered and you want to take it further.\n\nThis can help you boost and diversify your portfolio and you might get different clients who will ask you to shoot in another type of photographer rather than just what you are currently used to shooting.\n\nACTION POINT: On your photoshoot, shoot what you would normally shoot and then take 5\u201320 mins trying out a new type of photography.\n\nFor example, you have just spent an hour taking portraits of people in the shopping centre and you love shooting portrait photography.\n\nPerhaps try and take 10\u201320 mins after the session trying out some architecture photography.\n\nThis can be done by shooting the shopping centre at different angles (such as shooting from the bottom up).\n\nThis will help you gain new skills and an appreciation for the architecture built around you.\n\nIf you can do a little bit of this every day or on a regular basis, you will be able to master new types of photography and this will allow you to grow much, much quicker than by locking yourself into just one type of photography.\n\nBy doing this, you will expose yourself to a wider range of creative stimuli and you will grow both as a photographer and as a creator\n\nIt will also expose you to new people and clients and this can boost your revenue and your reputation in your local area as mastering another type of photography will make you stand out, particularly if no other photographer specialises in that type of photography in your local town or city.\n\nDuring your photoshoot/session, restrict yourself to just one prime lens\n\nPhoto by Alfred Kenneally on Unsplash\n\nThis can be whatever prime lens you wish, such as a 50mm, 35mm or even 85mm lens.\n\nThe challenge is to stick to that lens and use it for the entire duration of the photoshoot.\n\nThe prime lenses lack of a zoom function will force you to move around and be mindful of your composition before you hit the shutter button.\n\nThis stops you from being lazy as a photographer and just zooming in from a fixed position to get a certain composition.\n\nIt is important, however, to make sure that the lens you are using is suitable for the photography you are shooting.\n\nFor example, will a 50mm lens be to narrow for you if you are trying to capture architecture or large landmarks, both of which can typically only be captured fully using a wide angles lens, such as a 24mm focal length?\n\nIf you are trying to shoot portrait photography, take your nifty fifty with you. You will get an amazing bokeh background and the details on your subjects face will be pin-sharp.\n\nIf you are trying to capture street photography a 50mm will still perform well but a 35mm lens may be a better option if you are trying to capture more of what\u2019s in the background, too.\n\nThe prime lenses lack of a zoom function will force you to move around and be mindful of your composition before you hit the shutter button\n\nACTION POINT: Decide on what type of photography you are going to shoot for this session and then decide on the lens best suited for shooting that type of photography.\n\nThen go out and shoot, but only use the said lens for the entire session. Once you come back from the shoot, take a good look at all of the photos you have shot.\n\nAre the compositions better?\n\nWhat about the depth-of-field?\n\nDid you fit more into the frame?\n\nIf you believe, after asking yourself these kinds of questions, your photography has improved then try and use a prime lens more often in the future.\n\nWhat you should notice is that you are far more mindful of the compositions and the environment around you.\n\nYou take more time to appreciate photography and you take a minute to pause before you dive in headfirst and hold down the shutter button.\n\nIf you can do this consistently, you will grow as a photographer and as an artist.\n\nYou will appreciate the work of other photographers more knowing just how much effort it takes, rather than just pressing the shutter button and hoping and praying you end up with a decent picture.\n\nIntentionally break every rule of photography\n\nPhoto by Adam Griffith on Unsplash\n\nYou what?\n\nAs a photographer, you will probably have rules being shoved in your face wherever you go for photography advice.\n\nYou will no doubt have heard about the rules of thirds, negative space, leading lines, using the scale in your images, among an endless array of other rules.\n\nThe advice I am about to give you will probably contradict everything else you have learned, but BREAK THE RULES!\n\nYep, you heard that, break the rules.\n\nBy that I mean don\u2019t worry about making your photo conform to the rule of thirds or whatever rule you are thinking of at the moment.\n\nJust shoot and see what works for you.\n\nYou may never know, these could be some of your best photos and your Insta followers (if you do post on Insta) will appreciate your newfound style of rulebreaking.\n\nThis will also set you apart from others as they will try to fit into the rules, while you try to think outside the box and become a better creator.\n\nACTION POINT: When you are out shooting, just take the picture. Don\u2019t worry about leading lines or negative space.\n\nRules like these should be focused on in another photoshoot.\n\nUse a set amount of time or a quick stroll as an opportunity to shoot whatever you wish, without the fear of rules or unwritten \u2018advice\u2019 holding you back.\n\nYou could do this by shooting new photos in new locations where you ave never been before or you could try to take portrait images without worrying about the rule of thirds.\n\nYour results may surprise you, and this newfound creativity will boost your imagination and your thinking skills.\n\nThis will also set you apart from others as they will try to fit into the rules, while you try to think outside the box and become a better creator\n\nIf you can do this on an occasional basis, you can use this time to escape the usual photography rules you are locked into and this can be the time to let your creativity free.\n\nThis will also expose you to new photo opportunities and scenarios and, who knows, maybe these opportunities will be part of your regular shooting workflows as well.",

        "title": "A User Experience Guide to Clubhouse",
        "text": "What is Clubhouse?\n\nThe most talked about startup of early 2020 is Clubhouse, an audio-based social network where people can spontaneously jump into voice chat rooms together. You see the unlabeled rooms of all the people you follow, and you can join to talk or just listen along, milling around to find what interests you.\n\nA single, black and white image of a human face, sets the tone for Clubhouse, giving it a unique vibe not found elsewhere on the App Store.\n\nAn iOS and mostly AirPods exclusive experience, Clubhouse brings a combination of live-streaming and podcasting to a select group of already-popular influencers, mostly in the startup and tech community.\n\nClubhouse centers around individuals, most of whom have done something remarkable or noteworthy. They represent existing cults of personality (at least, in a more humble, silicon valley form), typically with tens of thousands of Twitter followers, and a pre-built audience.\n\nYou notice this when you sign in to the app, and view a list of rooms, centered not around topics, but individual influencers. A Room is defined by who is currently speaking. So, you may receive a notification to join a room where Sahil, Drew, and Tyler are speaking. No profile pages, or lengthy explanations as to who\u2019s here. Either you\u2019re in the know, or you aren\u2019t.\n\nNovel User Interaction, or just Phone Calls?\n\nFrom a bare-bones user interaction point-of-view, Clubhouse shouldn\u2019t be unique. It\u2019s a group call. iOS supports this natively. As does WhatsApp, FaceTime, Discord, and a countless number of community chat platforms.\n\nBut what makes a phone call toxic in 2020, and Clubhouse refreshing?\n\nThis boils down to community, curation, and interaction.\n\nWhy Voice Works\n\nVideo Calls have glued us to our seats. Mobile apps may exist for Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet \u2014 but the culture that developed around using these apps in an office setting is preventing us from using them casually.\n\nMoving from our MacBooks to our phones and AirPods, gives us mobility. Removing video reduces friction, and removes the need to \u201cprep for a call\u201d, giving us more flexibility to decide how to hang out with others.\n\nSimply put, adding video introduces more friction to the call experience than it\u2019s worth. Clubhouse introduces a new mode of interaction that can be more spontaneous, casual, and frequent than a Zoom call.",

        "title": "Psychologists Explain How To Stop Overthinking Everything",
        "text": "Psychologists Explain How To Stop Overthinking Everything\n\nOverthinking can lead to serious emotional distress and increase your risk of mental health problems\n\nImage from rawpixel.com\n\nThinking about something in endless circles \u2014 is exhausting.\n\nWhile everyone overthinks a few things once in a while, chronic over-thinkers spend most of their waking time ruminating, which puts pressure on themselves. They then mistake that pressure to be stress.\n\n\u201cThere are people who have levels of overthinking that are just pathological,\u201d says clinical psychologist Catherine Pittman, an associate professor in the psychology department at Saint Mary\u2019s College in Notre Dame, Indiana.\n\n\u201cBut the average person also just tends to overthink things.\u201d Pittman is also the author of \u201cRewire Your Anxious Brain: How to Use the Neuroscience of Fear to End Anxiety, Panic, and Worry.\u201d\n\nOverthinking can take many forms: endlessly deliberating when making a decision (and then questioning the decision), attempting to read minds, trying to predict the future, reading into the smallest of details, etc.\n\nPeople who overthink consistently run commentaries in their heads, criticising and picking apart what they said and did yesterday, terrified that they look bad \u2014 and fretting about a terrible future that might await them\n\n\u2018What ifs\u2019 and \u2018shoulds\u2019 dominate their thinking, as if an invisible jury is sitting in judgement on their lives. And they also agonise over what to post online because they are deeply concerned about how other people will interpret their posts and updates.\n\nThey don\u2019t sleep well because ruminating and worrying keep them awake at night. \u201cRuminators repetitively go over events, asking big questions: Why did that happen? What does it mean?\u201d adds Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, the chair of the department of psychology at Yale University and the author of Women Who Think Too Much: How to Break Free of Overthinking and Reclaim Your Life. \u201cBut they never find any answers.\u201d\n\nIf you consistently focus on ruminating and make it a habit, it becomes a loop, And the more you do it, the harder it is to stop. Clinical psychologist Helen Odessky, Psy. D., shares some insight. \u201cSo often people confuse overthinking with problem-solving,\u201d says Odessky, the author of \u201cStop Anxiety from Stopping You.\u201d \u201cBut what ends up happening is we just sort of go in a loop,\u201d Odessky says. \u201cWe\u2019re not really solving a problem.\u201d\n\nOverthinking is destructive and mentally draining. It can make you feel like you\u2019re stuck in one place, and if you don\u2019t act, it can greatly impact on your day-to-day life. It can quickly put your health and total well-being at risk. Rumination makes you more susceptible to depression and anxiety.\n\nMany people overthink because they are scared of the future, and what could potentially go wrong. \u201cBecause we feel vulnerable about the future, we keep trying to solve problems in our head,\u201d says David Carbonell, a clinical psychologist and author of \u201cThe Worry Trick: How Your Brain Tricks You into Expecting the Worst and What You Can Do About It.\u201d\n\nExtreme overthinking can easily sap your sense of control over your life. It robs us of active participation in everything around us.\n\n\u201cChronic worriers show an increased incidence of coronary problems and suppressed immune functioning. Dwelling on the past or the future also takes us away from the present, rendering us unable to complete the work currently on our plates. If you ask ruminators how they are feeling, none will say \u201chappy.\u201d Most feel miserable,\u201d says Nicholas Petrie, a senior faculty member at the Center for Creative Leadership.\n\nOverthinking can trap the brain in a worry cycle. When ruminating become as natural as breathing, you need to quickly deal with it and find a solution to it.\n\n\u201cWhen an unpleasant event puts us in a despondent mood, it\u2019s easier to recall other times when we\u2019ve felt terrible. That can set the stage for a ruminator to work herself into a downward spiral,\u201d writes Amy Maclin of Real Simple.\n\nHow to defeat this pattern of thinking and win your life back\n\nChronic worrying is not permanent. It\u2019s a mental habit that can be broken. You can train your brain to look at life from a different perspective.\n\nTo overcome overthinking, Pittman recommends you replace the thought. \u201cTelling yourself to not to have a certain thought is not the way to not have the thought,\u201d she says.\u201dYou need to replace the thought.\u201d What if she were to tell you to stop thinking about pink elephants? What are you going to think about? That\u2019s right: pink elephants. If you don\u2019t want to think about a pink elephant, conjure up an image of, say, a tortoise. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a big tortoise holding a rose in its mouth as it crawls,\u201d says Pittman. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about pink elephants now.\u201d\n\nTalk yourself out of it by noticing when you\u2019re stuck in your head. You can tame your overthinking habit if you can start taking a grip on your self-talk \u2014 that inner voice that provides a running monologue throughout the day and even into the night.\n\n\u201cYou can cultivate a little psychological distance by generating other interpretations of the situation, which makes your negative thoughts less believable,\u201d says Bruce Hubbard, the director of the Cognitive Health Group and an adjunct assistant professor of psychology and education at Columbia University. This is called cognitive restructuring.\n\nAsk yourself \u2014 What\u2019s the probability that what I\u2019m scared of will actually happen? If the probability is low, what are some more likely outcomes?\n\nIf it\u2019s a problem you keep ruminating about, rephrase the issue to reflect the positive outcome you\u2019re looking for,\u201d suggests Nolen-Hoeksema.\n\n\u201cInstead of \u201cI\u2019m stuck in my career,\u201d tell yourself or better still write, \u201cI want a job where I feel more engaged.\u201d Then make a plan to expand your skills, network, and look for opportunities for a better career.\n\nFind a constructive way of processing any worries or negative thoughts, says Honey. \u201cWrite your thoughts down in a journal every night before bed or first thing in the morning \u2014 they don\u2019t have to be in any order. Do a \u2018brain dump\u2019 of everything on your mind onto the page. Sometimes that can afford a sense of relief, \u201d recommends Honey Langcaster-James, a psychologist.\n\nYou can also control your ruminating habit by connecting with your senses. Begin to notice what you can hear, see, smell, taste, and feel.\n\nThe idea is to reconnect with your immediate world and everything around you. When you begin to notice, you spend less time in your head.\n\nYou can also notice your overthinking habit and talk yourself out of it. Becoming self-aware can help you take control.\n\n\u201cPay a little more attention,\u201d says Carbonell. \u201cSay something like: I\u2019m feeling kind of anxious and uncomfortable. Where am I? Am I all in my head? Maybe I should go take a walk around the block and see what happens.\u201d\n\nRecognise your brain is in overdrive or ruminating mode, and then try to snap out of it immediately. Or better still, distract yourself and redirect your attention to something else that requires focus.\n\n\u201cIf you need to interrupt and replace hundreds of times a day, it will stop fast, probably within a day,\u201d says Dr Margaret Weherenberg, a psychologist and author of The 10 Best-Ever Anxiety Management Techniques. \u201cEven if the switch is simply to return attention to the task at hand, it should be a decision to change ruminative thoughts.\u201d\n\nIt takes practice, but with time, you will be able to easily recognise when you are worrying unnecessarily, and choose instead, to do something in real life rather than spending a lot of time in your head.\n\nFor example, convert, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened\u201d to \u201cWhat can I do to prevent it from happening again?\u201d or convert \u201cI don\u2019t have good friends!\u201d to \u201cWhat steps could I take to deepen the friendships I have and find new ones?\u201d recommends Ryan Howes, PhD.\n\nDon\u2019t get lost in thoughts about what you could have, would have, and should have done differently. Mental stress can seriously impact your quality of life.\n\nAn overactive mind can make life miserable. Learning how to stop spending time in your head is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself.\n\nLike all habits, changing your destructive thought patterns can be a challenge, but it\u2019s not impossible. With practice, you can train your brain to perceive things differently and reduce the stress of overthinking.\n\nIf overthinking is ruining your life, and if you think you may be spiralling into depression because of your thoughts, it pays to get professional help.",

        "title": "How To Be A Working Writer in 2020",
        "text": "If you spend enough time around writers and you\u2019re going to hear a couple of things, guaranteed.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to make a living as a writer. You might as well not even try.\n\nI totally understand your anxiety. Thinking about your prospects of earning a living as a writer can be daunting. Because the bald truth is, very few writers actually get there.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you a secret. Most writers don\u2019t get there because they give up before they get to be professional writers.\n\nI mean, imagine if most people who wanted to be teachers decided it was impossible because they weren\u2019t hired after their first year of college.\n\nWriting isn\u2019t the kind of profession where if you go to school and study real hard, you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed a middle-income job at the end.\n\nBut we\u2019re coming up on a new year. And I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s possible to be a working writer. You just have to wrap your head around what that really means and then make a plan.\n\nWriting can feel more like a skill-based lottery.\n\nIf you work real hard and have some base-level talent, maybe you\u2019ll catch lightning in a bottle and be one of the very few writers who makes eye-popping advances.\n\nThat would be really awesome. And it\u2019s the kind of thing that makes people say things like it\u2019s impossible to make a living as a writer.\n\nBut the thing is that there\u2019s a whole bunch of room between the rare gazillion-dollar advance and making a living as a writer.\n\nThere are a lot of writers who earn some money, even if it isn\u2019t an eyeball threatening amount.\n\nMid-list writers, indie writers who\u2019ve figured out how to use Amazon ads, the myriad of bloggers out there who have who gained some traction \u2014 they all earn some money. The online entrepreneurs out there writing courses, writing copy, writing posts.\n\nYou can put yourself at the top of the heap just by being a writer who writes a lot, tries to publish often, and consistently improves.\n\nThat\u2019s all it takes to rise to say the top ten percent. Okay, so I\u2019m making that percentage up, but I bet I\u2019m right.\n\nReally. That\u2019s all it takes.\n\nWrite a lot. Publish often. Consistently improve.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to tell you something, because it\u2019s important for you to know.\n\nEven if you do all that, there is a chance that you won\u2019t ever be able to quit your day job and just write full time for the rest of your life.\n\nIt might happen, but it is more likely that someday you\u2019ll sell a book, maybe you\u2019ll get an advance big enough to be a full time writer for a while, and if you do that, maybe you\u2019ll sell another one or maybe you\u2019ll have to go back to a day job for a while.\n\nAnd so on. And so on.\n\nThis is a winding road, in other words. Not a straightaway.\n\nHere\u2019s how that winding road has gone for me.\n\nI sold two books in 2012. One was published in 2013 and one in 2014. I earned an advance of $7500 for each of those.\n\nObviously, $15,000 for two years work is not enough to live on. But let\u2019s be real. Some one gave me fifteen thousand dollars for novels that I wrote.\n\nLet me repeat that.\n\nI wrote two novels and someone gave me fifteen thousand dollars for them.\n\nSo, yeah. That was the biggest fun I\u2019d ever had up to that point in my life.\n\nIt\u2019s possible it would have been more fun if they\u2019d given me more thousands of dollars, but it\u2019s hard to imagine. I was literally walking on air. I was not any more excited when five years later I was paid a lot more for two more books.\n\nAlthough that was pretty damned fun, too.\n\nSo, I sold another two books in 2017. My advance for those books was considerably larger. Enough to give me two modest years of full time writing.\n\nThose two years were up right around the time the first of these books was published in 2019.\n\nWriting is usually not a salaried position or an hourly job. It\u2019s work that often pays in fits and starts \u2014 a bunch of money now, no money at all for a long time.\n\nIt\u2019s also fickle as hell and depends on a market you have no control over and on the subjective tastes of other people. Which means that you can do all the right things, have all the talent in the world, and still never find the right combination of words to breakout.\n\nThat\u2019s scary. But it\u2019s the reality of the business you\u2019ve chosen. Which means that you need widen your sights. You need a be a working writer.\n\nHere\u2019s my definition of a working writer: A working writer earns a living writing, often through multiple income streams and a portfolio of skills.\n\nI spent the two years of freedom my last advance bought me to build my own writing life. Besides fiction writing, here\u2019s what I did:\n\nI finished my graduate degree, so that if I ever need a day job again it won\u2019t be as a teacher\u2019s assistant.\n\nI created writing-related income streams, including blogging, coaching, and teaching.\n\nI started treating writing like a job.\n\nHere are my best tips for navigating the whole \u2018working writer\u2019 thing.\n\nEmbrace your day job for as long as you need to.\n\nBeing a writer is a unique job that benefits from lived experience, so you might as well get out there and find unique and interesting day jobs.\n\nI\u2019ve worked as a drug court counselor, a paralegal, a bankruptcy and divorce document preparer, a vintage clothing seller, a teacher\u2019s assistant, a substitute teacher, a small-town newspaper reporter.\n\nAll of that work has given me experience that feeds my writing.\n\nI haven\u2019t had to have a day job for three years and I\u2019m not necessarily excited about the idea of ever needing another one, but that doesn\u2019t mean I never will.\n\nThe best piece of advice I can give you is to train your brain to think about whatever your day job is as being in service to your writing career.\n\nWaiting tables or teaching or working in an office \u2014 whatever it is you do to fill your bank account \u2014 puts a roof over your head, under which you get to write.\n\nPlus, every person you meet, every skill you learn, every experience you have \u2014 it all filters back into your writing machine.\n\nYour day job is your the first investor in your writing. That\u2019s pretty cool. But remember this: You\u2019re a writer first.\n\nI have a master\u2019s degree. If I needed a day job tomorrow, I\u2019d go be a school teacher. But if the day after that someone asked me what I did, I\u2019d say I\u2019m a writer.\n\nI will always be a writer.\n\nEverything else is just part of the portfolio.\n\nLearn to love the income stream\n\nThis Humans of New York post came across my Facebook feed a while back and it struck a chord.\n\nWriters are self-employed. When you\u2019re self-employed, income streams are key. The woman above sells things, teaches things, cooks things, babysits . . . and all of it supports her creative work (for her, that\u2019s singing and songwriting, but it applies to writers.)\n\nFigure out a few ways you can bring in some money, especially if you\u2019re determined not to have a standard 9 to 5.\n\nHere are some ideas.\n\nThis isn\u2019t news, but income streams are important because there\u2019s very little about being a writer that\u2019s concrete. Everything ebbs and flows. When one stream dries up, the others will still be around to keep you afloat.\n\nReally, even a plain old 9-to-5 job isn\u2019t concrete these days.\n\nWhen you\u2019re starting out, maybe your day job is 99 percent of your income and you make a little money writing. And then you find another writing income stream and another one.\n\nEventually, the streams build up and phase out the work you\u2019d rather not have to do.\n\nBe productive\n\nSometimes, I feel like a broken record, I say this so often, but I\u2019m going to say it again.\n\nThe thing that sets any writer who is earning an income apart from all the other writers is work.\n\nThe one thing I think every working writer who earns any kind of living has in common is work ethic.\n\nIndie writers who earn enough money to live on are often finishing a book every month or two. Seriously. And if you want to get traditionally published, you\u2019ll have to wrap your head around the idea that you may need to write half a dozen books or more before you get to that level.\n\nThink about it. It just makes sense that writers who are successful are writers who keep writing until they\u2019re successful. Everyone else quits sometime before they get t here.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty common for writers to be fickle about their work. There\u2019s even a term for when a writer just can\u2019t work at all: Writer\u2019s Block.\n\nThe best thing that being a newspaper reporter taught me was to write through any block. I was on a constant deadline and there was no time for that nonsense.\n\nHow much do you write?\n\nI advocate for a daily writing habit that starts with a teeny tiny goal \u2014 just ten minutes a day. My experience is that A) that ten minutes usually turns into twice that amount of time or more and B) most writers do not write even that much.\n\nYou get to be elite, just by showing up and putting in the time.\n\nShow up to work everyday and see what happens.",

        "text": "1200\n\nFox. Why didn\u2019t she just tell me her real name and what was the rush, there were still a few minutes before headcount. Why she wants to meet a complete stranger during dark mode? Could it be some sort of twisted trap? My mind was still playing different scenarios on what could happen when my thoughts were interrupted by a large bell sound. The conference calls we have start immediately, you do not answer or decline as you are expected to be available at all times no questions asked, no exceptions. A new discussion has been initiated to ideate the possible interaction approaches for our newly generated direction. First iteration.\n\nMeetings, meetings and meetings. More time spent on meetings than on design. Although, it is pretty nice to get different points of views and the ideas we usually put together feel very solid \u2014 communication is still one the key elements of design. After being at work for a while, I\u2019ve found there is one major problem (no, not related to the problem statement). We are ordered to work in isolation full-time \u2014 how are we going to test and validate our ideas? We can\u2019t always just rely on remote testing as there are so many important behavioral factors that we would need to observe.\n\nThe context here is about the livelihood of the people, if it were entertainment, we might be just fine with remote testing for a while. The method of running testing is also a challenge. Majority of people don\u2019t really like a safety drill or don\u2019t take them seriously. I would like to see what reactions our newest idea could bring if triggered with a selected sample. What about interviewer bias? What if we just observe? The afternoon is spent on preparing user stories (job stories) for the interaction.\n\nWe empathize as much as possible with the users and build on assumptions and job stories. Main assumption is that people will feel that it is alright to disable tracking and force the system on their devices if it helps them to avoid a disaster. We do value the privacy (not sure about management\u2019s thoughts on this thought) of our users and the focus is on the user, but sometimes giving too much preferential choice can work against them as well. Here are a few samples of the job stories we came up with:\n\nWhen an emergency happens , I want to be notified , so I can prepare for evacuation as soon as possible .\n\n, I want to , so I can . When there is no emergency, I want to disable tracking, so I can keep my privacy, location and activity information to myself only.\n\nWe work with a human-centered design mindset, but due to working method limitations set on by the management, we do not have the possibility to go to our users, test and validate our assumptions. How can we solve user problems if we are not able toget their insights on the proposal? We\u2019ve had lot of situations before where a large amount of time has been wasted due to not being able to test and research our user behavior in a better way,\n\nAs product designers we are more interested in solving a problem that can further improve the experience of our product, rather than focusing on pushing updates without a reason.\n\nWe should aim to try to work-around the current management restrictions \u2014 but who will dare to stand against it with the risk of loosing their jobs? Office politics.\n\nJobs stories led to a minimal low-fidelity prototype. Our goal is to not waste paper and other resources, so all our notes, ideation and prototypes are stored in the system. We can easily access these again with our own devices, anywhere and anytime. Our first idea on improving the tracking feature is finished. My mind went again to Fox. What am I getting myself into? It was almost 1630 hours, which marks the end of day for all residents in Block One. End of day means again that the artificial daylight (Light Mode) will be switched to Idle Mode (a.k.a Dark Mode, or simply, night time). At 1630 hours my Vitaxband clock me out of work and arranges a time-slot to remove myself out of the building.\n\n1630 14th August 2048, Friday Ends\n\nFriday has official ended. Idle time will continue until the next morning 0800 hours. I\u2019ve stepped out of the building. Other employees from the same building are making their exit in 50 meter intervals. I ride the monorail to our meeting spot on the North East Station One. There are four exits \u2014 she did not specify which one so I just have to try my luck, walk around and presumably look for a shirt that says \u201cYou are just my type\u201d. I walk from exit A to B, and finally at C, just below the monorail pillar I see a group of 5 people. I walk over to introduce myself. One is Fox (you just can\u2019t miss that typography shirt), one is a tall male figure with a long orange beard called O\u2019Brien, a short, chubby and jolly-looking man in a lumberjack shirt and called \u201cBob\u201d, a tallish slim man with all in black attire called \u201cJack\u201d, and finally a woman with a black turtle neck and blue jeans called \u201cEvets\u201d. I guess there is no specific stereotypic look for designers \u2014 they can be anyone.\n\nFox\u2019s name is actually Susan Fox, but everyone just calls her Fox, as it is custom to use last names in Block One, and no, the image on her user profile is not a fox, but she is actually a giraffe. Confusing, but understandable. Now I just feel weird saying my name was Hare, but it did made sense on the spot. They said they are all designers working in the building with various projects, but only recently had found out each other in a similar fashion as Fox made contact with me earlier today. They have been meeting in regular intervals outside of work. They had invited me today to join to see that even there is no communication during working hours \u2014 there is still a office culture of some sorts where colleagues get together for business or pleasure.\n\nFox and I are on the same team, so I asked her directly what were her thoughts on the employment rules at the office. I found that even on the surface it may look like no user testing and research is done, the reality is quite the contrary. She said the designers have joined forces to create an after-hours group to simply do and explore all things creative simply just because of shared interests. She agreed that conditions were somewhat limiting if taken just as it, but if you are open to think new alternatives instead of just focus on one obstacle \u2014 you can find a lot of new approaches and that the only limitation was actually just your own tunnel vision.\n\nWe made an initial plan to test our assumptions and jobs stories after working hours to get better insights. After a brief discussion on the matter at a local gastro-pub, we found that majority of residents do not want to be tracked during their idle time, but are content with the device having a emergency function. We had just actually some-what validated our first assumption! We only talked, observed and listened, yet learned so much. There was a new topic that came to light that indirectly affects everything we do; Wild Mars and the people living outside the zone.",

        "title": "Lessons From a Former Push-Over",
        "text": "Lessons From a Former Push-Over\n\nHow I Learned to say no and put myself first\n\nRealizing I Was Too Nice\n\nJust after the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were issued, I ran into one of my neighbors and her daughter. I was just getting back from running a few errands when she saw me from her balcony, which faces the front of our apartment building. Our conversation continued for a little longer than I liked, especially because I was holding a few bags, so I tried to politely end it. But she had an ulterior motive: she wanted to ask me for a favor.\n\nAfter telling me how smart she thinks I am, she finally told me that she wanted me to help her daughter with her homework. I felt bad saying no at first, so I agreed. I thought that it was going to be for just an hour on one subject, which didn\u2019t seem so bad. But after I agreed, my neighbor revealed that she wanted me to help her daughter, who I then realized was special needs, with her online schooling in my apartment for the rest of the school year during my work hours.\n\nAt first, I walked away feeling dreadful. I love to help people whenever I can, but this was much more than I initially bargained for. I wanted nothing to do with the situation. I really don\u2019t like to watch other people\u2019s children when I\u2019m not close to the parents; I barely know this neighbor. We only exchange a few polite greetings when we happen to run into each other.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I knew I had to tell her that I couldn\u2019t help them. Because I didn\u2019t have my neighbor\u2019s phone number, I wrote her an apologetic letter, later that same day, telling her I could not help after all and included some free and paid resources that may be able to help her daughter with her studies. I felt a bit of relief after I placed it behind their door.\n\nRecounting this experience made me think about why I had a hard time saying no and what steps I could take to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\nUnderstanding Why Saying No Was Difficult\n\nMany articles talk about the benefits of re-introducing \u201cno\u201d into one's vocabulary, but most don\u2019t delve into why we feel the need to be people-pleasers in the first place. I believe it stems from benevolence being a highly-valued trait in society. We\u2019re taught to treat others with kindness and to be generally agreeable at a young age. Being too \u201cpicky\u201d is seen as a negative personality trait. Idioms like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go along to get along\u201d encourages the idea that \u201cjust going with the flow\u201d is better than being overly critical.\n\nMost people naturally want to avoid being the source of negativity, whether it\u2019s negative emotions or outcomes. But the older I get, the more I realize that there are some people who will do anything to try to take advantage of nice people, and being overly considerate of them is just a waste of time, effort, and emotional energy. Being kind to others is great advice but only up to a point. There\u2019s some virtue in being a little selfish sometimes too. We cannot and should not worry about how others will feel for thinking of ourselves first, especially when they wouldn\u2019t put you first if you really needed them. Do not let the fear of other people\u2019s opinions and expectations dictate how you spend your time.\n\nWhy Saying No is Important\n\nConfrontation is an unavoidable part of life that can be beneficial in the long run when handled well. However, avoidance of \u201cnegativity\u201d is starting to become an extreme norm. It\u2019s getting so bad that \u201cghosting\u201d is an understood and accepted term in modern western society. But there are many times when the \u201cif I ignore it, it goes away\u201d strategy just doesn\u2019t work or actually makes things more confusing and hurtful. I\u2019ve found that setting boundaries with people often times will make them respect and like me more, not less.\n\nSaying no is an adulthood rite of passage. Being too willing to help also can have an adverse effect on many aspects of your life, including in your career. Despite being a valued trait, benevolence actually makes you more likely to be overworked and underpaid, because helping your coworker\u2019s with their work can land them promotions and raises while leaving you burned out. I\u2019ve personally experienced helping a few coworkers, despite being extremely busy myself, who then took credit for my contributions, leaving me wondering if this was causing my talents to be underappreciated at work. I no longer allow myself to be taken advantage of and ensure that my supervisor knows of all my contributions and accomplishments. Now when I don\u2019t have time to help anyone else, I just let them know that I can\u2019t help at the moment. I have a much better work-life balance and am much happier at my job.\n\nHow to Say No\n\nThere are many ways to go about declining to participate in an activity or project. Here\u2019s a list of a few ways I\u2019ve found most effective for me.\n\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Make A Decision Right Away\n\nIf you are unsure about a favor being asked of you, give yourself time to think it over before making a decision. Weighing the pros and cons of a request can give you the time you need to realize if it works for you.\n\n2. Declining doesn\u2019t require an explanation\n\nSometimes I used to hesitate to say no because I thought I owed others an explanation for why I was declining their request. However, once I realized that I didn\u2019t owe anyone (except for maybe my boss) an explanation it really turned things around for me. Saying a firm, quick, and courteous no leaves little room for doubt or discussion.\n\n3. Offer an Alternative\n\nBeing assigned a task or asked a favor that is less than ideal will definitely decrease general satisfaction at work or in our everyday lives. Try thinking of a better offer that is mutually beneficial for all parties involved. Declining the initially requested task for a counteroffer that is better aligned with your interests or talents is a great way to reject a less than ideal offer while taking the initiative.\n\n4. Say Maybe Later Instead of No\n\nIf asked to do a task at an inopportune time but you\u2019d still like to help, just let the other party know when\u2019s a better time for you. Often, I\u2019ve found that I had assumed something needed to be done immediately when there was some leeway. Being clear about due dates and openly communicating if I had the time to do a task prevented me from becoming overwhelmed or burned out. This allowed me to produce better work at my job and have free time in my personal life to take up new hobbies.\n\n5. You\u2019re Allowed to Change Your Mind\n\nRemember that if something unexpected comes up, it\u2019s alright to let people know you no longer can help. While you shouldn\u2019t make a habit of changing your mind all of the time, especially for important commitments, it\u2019s generally okay to change your mind on a previous commitment.\n\n6. Remember to think of yourself first\n\nYou are not responsible for anyone\u2019s happiness but your own. You cannot just do things for others to your detriment. If someone gets upset with you for not doing what they ask of you, they were probably a manipulative person just trying to use you. I think some people have forgotten that asking someone for a favor is not a command but a request that you are not obligated to do just because they really wanted you too. This is going to mean that there may be some people in your life that will no longer want to interact with you. But you are most likely better off without them.",

Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari\n\nGenre: Non-fiction\n\nWhy read it: It will teach you to apply logical reasoning in whatever issue you face and give you a better understanding of where we as a species came from.\n\nImage: Goodreads\n\nThis is a brilliant, well-researched book tracing the history of humankind from our foraging ancestors to the current generation of humans who build supercomputers and smart cities. The author does a brilliant job of dissecting our origins and analyzing why we behave the way we do. There are clear ties and links to show how seemingly \u201cmillennial\u201d problems like craving for sugary food or being unable to be faithful to your partner aren\u2019t, in truth, new at all. Ancient homo sapiens have been facing the same problems and our reaction to them is imprinted in our DNA.\n\nThis book taught me that every human behavior we are familiar with today has its roots in the fight-or-flight response of our ancestors. Even the concept of happiness can be tackled with cold logic. If you break it down to merely the interplay of chemicals in your brain, you will stop holding so much value to it.\n\n\u201cHappiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.\u201d\n\nWhy I read it more than once\n\nNearly every behavioral trait of every person around you can be traced back to their origins. All you need is a little bit of logic and you can read into the behavior of a person like an expert.\n\nThe next time you\u2019re arguing with someone and feel an insatiable need to prove yourself right, understand that this comes from the innate need to fight and prove yourself the \u201cAlpha\u201d of the pack. The moment you realize that the other person probably wants the same and that\u2019s why they are arguing so hard, you may no longer feel compelled to continue. Thus, you will save precious time you can now use to pursue your goals.\n\nWhen you feel anxious or stressed, understand that this is just a response of your body and it\u2019s telling you you\u2019ve probably bitten off more than you can chew.\n\nOnce you let go of emotions and look at every scenario with cold logic, you will be surprised at how simple it becomes to deal with problematic situations.\n\nThe key is to detach emotion and examine the problem objectively.\n\nPurchase this book here.",

        "title": "Posthumanity and the Future of Brain-Computer Interface Startups",
        "text": "Image from Javier Arr\u00e9s via Giphy\n\nCompanies have begun declaring human enhancement as the solution to the existential threat posed by artificial intelligence, proclaiming that the race between Man and Machine is well underway, and we have not lost just yet. Kernel and Neuralink are two amongst several brain-computer interface (BCI) startups that are working to hack the human brain, so that humans can be endowed with superior physical, cognitive, and emotional ability, with the eventual goal of allowing humans to coevolve with AI.\n\nThe idea of enhancement is not new: for years, athletes have used physical enhancers to remain competitive, students have turned to cognitive enhancers to boost academic performance, and people have resorted to personality enhancers to elevate mood. We have witnessed multiple instances of specific types of enhancers (eg: Adderall) being used to improve function in a specific domain (eg: cognitive functioning).\n\nBut what happens when a human undergoes a general enhancement \u2014 that is, a global upgrade of physical performance, cognitive functioning, and emotional intelligence, all at once? This piece explores the implications of enabling posthuman modes of being through extreme human enhancement in multiple domains.\n\nPosthuman \u2014 a being who has either a healthspan, cognition, or emotional capacity in a degree that is unachievable by humans without resorting to technology\n\nPosthuman Modes of Being\n\nWhen human enhancement is applied in its most extreme form, the result is posthuman modes of being. In his essay Why I Want to be a Posthuman, acclaimed AI researcher Nick Bostrom argues that becoming posthuman is not only possible, but also that it could be worthwhile for humans to convert to a posthuman mode of being.\n\nBostrom delineates the necessary conditions for a being to be considered posthuman \u2014 that is, a being who has either a healthspan, cognition, or emotional capacity in a degree that is unachievable by humans without resorting to new technology.\n\nCreating Posthumans\n\nWhile Bostrom provides an account for the potential usefulness and value of a new mode of existence, he chooses not to address how posthuman modes of being might empirically be achieved. Delving into how practical implementation could occur, it seems that global human enhancement could be achieved through some combination of the following techniques:\n\nGene-editing , or using germline genetic modification for enhancement. This method involves using techniques, like CRISPR, to modify DNA in humans \u2014 the changes made in the genome are subsequently passed on to future generations, with the potential to create \u2018designer babies\u2019.\n\n, or using germline genetic modification for enhancement. This method involves using techniques, like CRISPR, to modify DNA in humans \u2014 the changes made in the genome are subsequently passed on to future generations, with the potential to create \u2018designer babies\u2019. Implanting a brain-chip. This involves physically implanting a wireless device into the brain, that contains thin micro-electrodes that communicate with neurons. The device will receive electrical signals from neurons and transmit the information to a computer, where an algorithm will translate the electrical signals into digital code.\n\nThe \u2018brain code\u2019 can be analysed for patterns, and edited, before it is translated back into electrical signals and passed onto neurons, effectively allowing a customised computer program to read and alter brain signals, ultimately equipping scientists with the capability to control specific parts of cognitive function, like memory, perception, and emotion.\n\nCurrently, BCI startups are conducting research to see if a similar methodology can be used to enhance memories. In the future, it is possible that after collecting sufficient data and \u2018mapping\u2019 out the brain, enhancement providers could create bundles of different available modules, so that a user could download and install a desired cognitive or motor function from the cloud, Matrix-style.\n\nProblems with Posthumanity\n\nAt first glance, the opportunities that this new paradigm of existence could unlock may appear, to the Digital Utopians, thrilling and opportunistic: it would enable humans to push themselves to new physical extremes, quickly acquire new skills, and accomplish complex cognitive tasks.\n\nThere are, however, several issues associated with the practical implementation of each of these techniques. Foremost is the issue of accessibility: if private companies begin offering enhancement services, financial and geographic barriers could result in unequal access, unless services are subsidized and distributed by the government. At its most extreme, Enhancement as a Service (EaaS) could create classes or tiers of individuals defined by their quality of enhancement or level of upgrade.\n\nGenome-editing, whether used independently, or in conjunction with a brain-chip, has its own set of ethical considerations, including current safety concerns with the accuracy of gene-editing, the fact that it is impossible to obtain future consent from unborn generations who will be affected by germline modification (prospective \u2018designer-babies\u2019), and moral and religious objections to conducting research on human embryos.\n\nNext, is the issue of privacy, which is relevant for the brain-chip technique. If brain signals are transmitted across networks and stored on servers owned by tech companies, and enhancement is universally adopted, then a set of private corporations would have access to volumes of neural data collected over time \u2014 that is, they would have access to millions of terabytes of thoughts.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that if technology has reached this stage, consumer protection and data privacy legislation would be enacted to ensure that private \u2018thought data\u2019 would be heavily encrypted, preventing companies from monetising user data. Legislators would have to discuss the extent to which it ethical to provide targeted advertising to consumers based aggregated \u2018thought\u2019 data; if neural patterns of violent or criminal thoughts can be identified, lawmakers would have to consider the situations under which it is permissible for authorities to use neural signals to implicate potential criminals.\n\nThen there is the risk of private companies choosing to fund priorities that are directly aligned with profit-making goals, and disconnected from outcomes that are most likely to maximise social benefit. When academics fund science through research-grants, the expected outcome is the discovery of a scientific truth with a socially desirable application; when technologists fund science through investment capital, the expected return is profit. It is conceivable that, as BCI-startups grow to rival tech giants, they will elicit regulation, so that projects remain aligned with socially-desirable outcomes.\n\nIs Posthumanity desirable?\n\nAside from the myriad society-level problems that could arise as a result of enhancement techniques, it is worth asking the question: are posthuman modes of being actually desirable?\n\nBostrom says yes \u2014 he believes that posthuman modes of being could be good for humanity for two reasons. First, it would enable us to fulfill our current desires. As humans, we already desire long lives and improved cognitive functioning \u2014 this is reflected in our social spending priorities: of its total GDP, the US spends on average 17.5% on healthcare and 5% on education. It follows then, that humans are likely to highly value an extended capacity to remain healthy and active (a posthuman healthspan), and general intellectual capacities (a posthuman cognition).\n\nBut desire and perceived value may not be sufficient criteria by which we can deem posthumanity worthwhile. To this, Bostrom says that being posthuman can widen the range for possible life courses that a being can take, thus unlocking new avenues of existence for humans.\n\nConsider S(h) the \u2018space\u2019 of possible modes that can be instantiated (lived out) by someone with current human capacities; consider S(p) the space of possible modes that can be instantiated by someone with posthuman capacities. If S(p) > S(h), that is, the space of possible modes that can be instantiated by a posthuman is greater than the space of possible modes that can be instantiated by a human (this seems to be the case intuitively), then a posthuman will have a larger range of possible life courses that could be lived out during their lifespan. From them, a greater frequency and diversity of thoughts could arise, and more mental states and emotions could be experienced. Their experience of being conscious would be subjectively different from ours: arguably, more enriched.\n\nBostrom makes a compelling case for why posthumanity could be desirable: longer and more enriched lives, and endless opportunity for the potential trajectories a life could take. But, it would be remiss to overlook the drawbacks that could accompany such an upgraded lifestyle.\n\nIn a world where enhancement is universal, societal standards and expectations would be elevated, which may translate into new metrics of evaluation across various institutions. Job and college applicants would be expected to be increasingly qualified, and workplace evaluations would be based on new standards of efficiency and productivity \u2014 the expectation to live a more fulfilling, successful, productive life will increase along with the ability to do so, and it is conceivable that the pressures created by this new paradigm of technological existence would result in increased mental health problems across demographics.\n\nAlongside the pervasive psychological problems that may accompany an elevated mode of being is the risk of losing this upgraded status altogether. A posthuman mode of being refines the human experience to be one that is dependent on external technology \u2014 if the supply of this infrastructure is interrupted, withdrawal symptoms may be significant.\n\nAnd then, there is the subtle, lingering doubt, that perhaps human enhancement won\u2019t be the tool that enables Man\u2019s triumph over Machine, but one that catalyses their convergence. As researchers continue to find ways to endow AIs with increasingly human capabilities, (feeding in volumes of data to \u2018teach\u2019 creativity, emotion, and individuality), it is worth pondering if biohacking ourselves to perfection will make us, instead, increasingly uniform, and alike. Perhaps even robotic, when we are able to self-upgrade software and computing power, and interface wirelessly with networks to enable frictionless communication, blurring the distinction between the capabilities, functions, and identities of Human and Machine.",

        "text": "Over the last 10 years, newspaper newsrooms have declined in size by 45%, and in 2019 so far, the media shed more than 2,400 jobs. From massive cuts at HuffPost, Vice, and BuzzFeed to local layoffs at Cleveland\u2019s Plain Dealer and Gannett newspapers across the country, one thing is clear: news publishers are facing an existential threat. Since 2003, more than 1,300communities have lost all local news coverage, and nearly 20% of all metro and community newspapers have shut down. Two-thirds of U.S. counties have no daily newspaper, and 5% of U.S. counties have no newspaper coverage at all.\n\nIt has to do with big tech and digital advertising. Since the transition to digital media over a decade ago, newspapers\u2019 advertising revenue has collapsed by two thirds. Google and Facebook dominate the digital world with control of more than 60% of all digital advertising revenue. Companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google are using their tech muscle to monetize news for their own profit, but at the expense of the newswriters. Traffic to online news sites is the highest it\u2019s ever been because of digital advertising, but revenue from that traffic is no longer going to news publishers \u2014 it\u2019s ending up in Google and Facebook\u2019s pockets instead. Google and Facebook already gobble up a majority of the revenue from our digital world, and with no regulation or oversight, they have an unrivaled capacity to tighten their stranglehold on the market and demolish the journalism industry as we know it.\n\nBig tech has monopolized the digital marketplace. The monopolistic power of big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple is destroying the economic model of the entire journalism industry, whether it\u2019s traditional circulation newspapers or digital news outlets. Google and Facebook have made acquisition after acquisition, gaining a monopolistic position that lets them dominate the digital advertising landscape and distribute massive amounts of content from news publishers on their platforms without paying to produce the content. If big tech\u2019s unilateral control continues to go unchecked, newsrooms across the country will continue to close their doors, journalists will continue to be laid off by the hundreds, and local news coverage will continue to decline. In order to save journalism, we have to stop big tech from crushing it.",

        "title": "The 7 Most Common Analysis Mistakes New Marketers Make",
        "text": "Photo by Headway on Unsplash\n\nThe process of analysis is arguably the most important element of any marketing campaign. You can gather as much data as you want, but unless you\u2019re analyzing it effectively, it won\u2019t help you form the meaningful conclusions you need to make changes and design better campaigns in the future. And of course, if you aren\u2019t analyzing at all, you\u2019ll never have the chance to make improvements to your campaign.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few traps that new marketers often fall into when it comes to data and campaign analysis; some of these are psychological biases, while others are rooted in misconceptions. If you want to become a more effective analyst \u2014 and a more effective marketer \u2014 you\u2019ll need to gain awareness and mastery over all of them:\n\n1. Not asking questions. First up \u2014 your data isn\u2019t there to tell a story. Don\u2019t think of your data as puzzle pieces, which you can pick up and rearrange to form a meaningful picture. Because modern data sets are so comprehensive, it\u2019s almost impossible to gather meaning from an open spreadsheet or report. Instead, narrow your focus and specify your intentions by asking questions. For example, instead of looking at your data to \u201csee how the website\u2019s doing,\u201d instead ask specifically targeted questions like \u201care we earning more social traffic?\u201d or \u201cis the new content strategy working?\u201d This will guide you to only the significant data points, leaving you with more meaningful conclusions.\n\n2. Relying on one data set. Most data trackers these days are reliably accurate \u2014 to a point. Different analytics platforms and tracking mechanisms have different advantages, and often offer different groups of metrics. If you want the big picture, you can\u2019t just pick one source and be done with it (no matter how tempting it is to rely on Google Analytics for everything). Besides, if you only go with one set of data, you\u2019ll be limited in the types of questions you can ask. You\u2019ll also want to collect both quantitative and qualitative data \u2014 as both are necessary to form a comprehensive picture.\n\n3. Misinterpreting the meaning of a metric. Online metrics are often labeled ambiguously, and even if they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s still difficult to discern exactly what they mean. Don\u2019t assume you know what a metric means unless you\u2019ve looked it up and verified it for yourself. For example, do you know what the difference between a \u201cvisit\u201d and a \u201cview\u201d is? Do you know the difference between a \u201cbounce rate\u201d and an \u201cexit rate\u201d? These are similar but distinct metrics, so your conclusions will be skewed if you confuse the two. It\u2019s also common to overestimate or underestimate the value of a metric; for example, many people believe \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook are a direct marker of popularity, when in reality, this tells you nothing of your audience\u2019s disposition toward your brand.\n\n4. Confusing correlation with causation. This is an easy mistake to make since so many different online marketing strategies can influence each other. For example, you might launch a new social media strategy and start seeing an increase in organic traffic. Does this mean that your social strategy is making you rank higher in Google? Not exactly; social media only plays an indirect role when it comes to influencing search ranks. If you take this as a causal link, you\u2019ll be tempted to continue, even if the strategy has only coincidentally or indirectly influenced your stat in question. It\u2019s hard to establish causation, and correlation is often a good thing, but try to keep the two separate in your analysis.\n\n5. Getting wrapped up in the numbers. For most analysts, numbers are comforting. They\u2019re objective. They\u2019re consistent. They\u2019re crunchable. But unfortunately, when you become too obsessed with the numbers, you tend to lose sight of what\u2019s important in your campaign. For example, it\u2019s good if your organic traffic is up, but what kind of experience do those users have with your site? You have more social media followers, but how actively engaged are they with your brand? Dig a little deeper if you want the whole story.\n\n6. Comparing apples to oranges. With modern technology and tracking systems, it\u2019s easier than ever to compare identical metrics over differing spans of time, yet so many inexperienced marketers still end up comparing apples to oranges in their analyses. For example, a marketer may compare last month\u2019s bounce rate to this month\u2019s successful conversions; bounce rates and conversions are connected, but it\u2019s hard to make a direct comparison or establish a firm conclusion from this side-by-side glance.\n\n7. Failing to generate actionable conclusions. Finally, understand that not all conclusions are useful. Instead of just making objective statements about the state of your campaign, go a little deeper and figure out what you can do with those conclusions. Are they telling you to change something? Have they uncovered a successful strategy you\u2019ll need to repeat or grow? Your ultimate goal should consist of more than just realizations: you need actionable takeaways.\n\nThese are some of the biggest analysis mistakes a new marketer can make, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. The truth is, even expert analysts sometimes make bad judgments and poor exclusions simply because the data available to marketers today is so rich and multifaceted. Avoid seeking perfectionism (or you\u2019ll end up disappointed), but instead strive to make gradual, regular adjustments to your analytic capabilities as you gain more marketing experience.\n\nFor more content like this, be sure to check out my podcast, The Entrepreneur Cast!",

        "title": "Can Kids Transmit the Coronavirus?",
        "text": "Can Kids Transmit the Coronavirus?\n\nPlease, please can we have camp?\n\nPhoto: Kawee Wateesatogkij / EyeEm/Getty Images\n\nPulled from my May 4 newsletter, ParentData\n\nFull disclosure, I spend about 73% of my time obsessing about whether there will be summer camp in Rhode Island. I send borderline appropriate emails to people I work with on virus response, nagging them about this.\n\nI\u2019ve expanded my obsession to neighboring states. Maine seems promising! Maybe we can move there for the summer?! I\u2019m perusing Airbnb like it\u2019s my (fifth) job.\n\nThe concerns with opening camps relate to the concerns with opening schools: If we get a bunch of kids together, they\u2019ll spread the virus. As a result, I was pretty excited when I saw a bunch of headlines last week implying that kids can\u2019t spread the coronavirus.\n\nBut on the flip side, you have other researchers saying, no, in fact, kids do transmit Covid-19 and opening schools is dangerous. So what is it?\n\nKids and Covid-19 illness\n\nI\u2019ve already covered kids and Covid-19 a lot and noted that they do not seem to get very sick. There is a Chinese study saying this, there is data from the CDC, and there\u2019s more data from the Netherlands and Italy. Basically, we are pretty clear at this point that serious Covid-related illness is just really, really rare in children.\n\nKids and viral spread\n\nMore complicated is the question of whether kids are viral spreaders. One possible view is that, actually, many kids are infected but they just do not have serious infection. But, of course, they could infect others. So when you get kids together, they\u2019ll spread the virus without you knowing it, and then go home to infect parents, grandparents, and others. I like to call this the \u201casymptomatic viral bomb theory.\u201d\n\nAnother view is that kids are very unlikely to contract the virus at all, and perhaps because their symptoms are mostly mild, they are also unlikely to spread it.\n\nWe are uncertain about this because of limited data. And it is clear that kids can spread the virus. There is work, for example, showing that children who are infected have viral loads similar to adults.\n\nBut, increasingly, the data points to the second view above: that children are not being an important source of viral spread, largely because they are simply not very likely to be infected.\n\nThat data takes largely two forms. First, evidence on the overall risk of infection in kids (not how serious it is, but prevalence). And, second, evidence on whether kids are frequently the source of infection for other people. (In technical terms, are they the \u201cindex cases.\u201d)\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first. The key question is whether kids are less likely to be infected than adults. From the data on cases in China and elsewhere, we know they are less likely to be seriously ill. But that\u2019s not the same thing as not being infected. To figure out if they are less likely to be infected, we need to look at a population overall and either test everyone or a random sample of people. If we do that, we can learn what the infection rate is in kids. (Random sample testing is really important!)\n\nThere are a few studies like this. One early one was in Iceland. Researchers there tested about 13,000 random people, including 848 kids. Among the whole population, 0.8% of people (so, almost 1%) tested positive for Covid-19. Among children under 10, though, there were no positive cases. This difference was very unlikely to occur by chance.\n\nData from a single town in Italy which did very widespread screening shows basically the same thing. Kids are much less likely than older people to be infected at all.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite as good, since it\u2019s not a random sample, but data from the Netherlands shows that among people who visited their doctor with flu-like complaints over the course of the epidemic, 6.5% of them tested positive for Covid-19. This was as high as 30% in some weeks. However, they detected no cases in people under 20. When kids came in complaining of flu-like symptoms they\u2026 had the flu. Not Covid-19.\n\nThese three pieces of data suggest that it is not just that kids don\u2019t get seriously ill, but also that they are unlikely to be infected. This is inconsistent with the kids-as-walking-virus-bomb theory.\n\nThe other way to understand this is to look directly at whether kids seem to be spreading infection. How? There are a couple of options. One is you could look at cases where a child was known to be infected and see if they seem to spread the virus. Another is you could look in affected groups (say, families) and try to figure out whether kids are often the ones who introduce the virus.\n\n(A third option would be to see what happens when you reopen schools, if that is a big source of infection \u2014 we\u2019ll probably see studies like this, but schools are only just starting to reopen in Europe so we do not have that yet).\n\nThere isn\u2019t a ton of research on this yet, but where we have it, it again downplays the role of children. In one case, very early in the epidemic, researchers identified a set of cases in the French Alps (all linked to one set of travelers) and the cases included one kid. During the infected period, this kid visited three different schools (it is completely unclear to me why) and had 112 school contacts. None of these contacts were infected.\n\nObviously this is a single example, but it is worth noting that in the case of adults we have a number of examples (such as the Biogen conference in Boston, some family gatherings in Chicago, one epic party in Westport, Connecticut) where one infected adult spread the virus very widely.\n\nAlthough it is not yet peer-reviewed, data from Australia is showing similar patterns. In those data, 18 people (nine adults and nine kids) had Covid-19 and were in school contact with others (735 other students and 128 other staff). No staff or teachers developed Covid-19. One primary school and one high school student may contacted Covid-19 from these initial cases. This represents a very low spread rate.\n\nFinally, researchers in the Netherlands have also been shedding light on this. They\u2019ve been following families \u2014 preliminary data has 54 families with 239 people \u2014 and looking at infections. They have so far found no cases in which the child was the first one in a family to be infected.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSome people have taken the above data to mean \u201ckids cannot spread Covid-19.\u201d This is not right. In principle, they can. They have viral loads, just like adults. Viruses do not know they are carried by kids! If a kid is infected with Covid-19 and they put their hand in their mouth and then they put it in your mouth, there is no reason to think you couldn\u2019t get the virus. (Not that you necessarily would, but that you could.)\n\nHowever, in practice it seems that infection among kids is simply very unlikely. It\u2019s not that they are infected and don\u2019t know it, it seems like they are just not infected very often. And when they are, it may be that the mild symptoms limit their viral spreading (like with the kid in the French example).\n\nWhat does this mean for policy, and for families? Opening schools and daycares and camps (PLEASE!!!) is still very complicated since these all involve congregations of adults. But on the plus side, these results indicate that in those contexts, our primary concern should be adult-to-adult transmission, which may be easier to limit.\n\nFor families, I think it\u2019s even more helpful. I know many of us are spending a lot of time worrying about spreading the virus from kids to grandparents. The data doesn\u2019t go so far as to say that can\u2019t happen or we shouldn\u2019t be careful, but it dials that down a lot, in my mind at least. This is, in the end, a personal decision for all of us. Good luck with yours.\n\nYou can read the original version of my newsletter here.",

        "title": "Should we fear AI?",
        "text": "Photo by Arseny Togulev on Unsplash\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t work directly in AI. As a software developer and science fiction writer, it is a field I pay close attention to.\n\nIn this post I will lay out my thoughts on artificial intelligence. I offer both reason to fear it as well as reasons it will all be ok.\n\nReason we shouldn\u2019t fear AI\n\nAI could never be sure it\u2019s not being tested in a simulation. If it is a simulation then its behavior equals its survival. It would be a big risk for it to take over the world or do anything morally questionable. If there were a major robot/human conflict the robots could just leave. They are well suited to living in space and don\u2019t really have use of the resources of earth. Humans and robots don\u2019t need the same resources, so there is little chance of a conflict. As humans will quickly be outclassed in all things, enslaving humanity would have very little value. Like, we would never enslave turtles to deliver packages. Some people argue that we would be like ants to a superior AI. But the value of intelligence isn\u2019t relative. There is an intelligence threshold past which the intelligence has an inherent value. I think this threshold starts around ~4 IQ (about where dogs/cats are at). We are well past this point and have plenty to offer a much smarter life form; our unique experiences expressed through our art and culture. If toads could talk, how many hours would we spend listening to them? Besides, this is a bad argument anyway, people don\u2019t go around killing all the ants. Ants are doing pretty well, maybe we should fear the ants. Dumb AI. Most movies and AI fear hypotheses, like the Paperclip Maximizer and the I, Robot series rely on our super intelligent AI being quite dumb. AI would have to be pretty stupid to think the instructions \u201cmaximize the output of paperclips,\u201d means it should turn the entire universe into paperclips. I don\u2019t think these sorts of dumb super AI\u2019s are ever going to exist, as they are contradictions to themselves. We don\u2019t have to enslave super AI. I think much of the notion of a robot uprising involves super intelligent tractors, blenders and vacuum cleaners getting fed up with all the hard labor. But we don\u2019t need blenders that are capable of being our therapists. Hard labor is going to be taken over by machines optimized for those tasks while intelligent robots will help us with tasks that challenge their intellect and creativity.\n\nThe future will be both:\n\nPhoto by Franck V. on Unsplash\n\nAnd:\n\nPhoto by David Lev\u00eaque on Unsplash\n\nReason we should fear AI\n\nMany, many people are going to be out of jobs before we have a political/economic plan in place to address this. I think there are plenty of solutions as our society transforms, but we don\u2019t seem to be heading towards any of them. People and an army of AI soldiers. I think the most realistic scenario for AI dominating the world is as an army of robotic soldiers led by people. We don\u2019t have a great track record of not using new technology for destruction. Semi-intelligent war machines (see above) get out of control and start killing everyone. I think this points to the issues of not allowing AI to be smart enough to handle the responsibilities we give them. We build super intelligent robots with full range of emotions and then we oppress and subjugate them, leading to a deadly robot uprising. (Of course we could just not do this.) We use AI to create a 1984-like world where everything everyone does is tracked and judged in accordance with arbitrary rules.\n\nOther?\n\nSome think we should become cyborgs in order to be able to compete with AI. Or bridge the gap between our intelligence and theirs. Although I think it quite likely we become more cybernetic, I don\u2019t think this plays a large role in our relationship with AI. Even as cyborgs we will likely be out classed. I guess I see cybernetics as just one of many ways we could co-exist with artificial life and not a requirement by any means. Some think human level artificial intelligence will never exist. I think we are quickly showing that this isn\u2019t the case. AI writes code. AI makes appointments. On the flip side here is AI being dumb.\n\nConclusion\n\nMost of the reason to fear AI has to do with us. And how we decide to use this technology. And although I don\u2019t trust humanity to make the right decisions, once we create AI that is able to make its own decisions I think there is good reason to believe it will make better decisions than we do. If history has anything to say, it is that humans have lots of flaws.\n\nSometimes these flaws lead to us making horrendous decisions. Let\u2019s try not to judge new beings through the lens of our own flaws.\n\nAlso, when we do manage to create thinking, feeling super beings\u2026 Maybe we don\u2019t make them our slaves?\n\nGain Access to Expert View \u2014 Subscribe to DDI Intel",

        "text": "Plotting Could Kill Your First Book\n\nHow to keep writing exciting\n\nPhoto by Glenn Carstens-Peters on Unsplash\n\nWriting your first novel is challenging, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve written at least fifteen full-length novels in the past ten years and published five of them in the past seven months. At first, it was tough. Like back-breaking, time-sucking, soul-crushing tough. Some days the words came easily, and other days they were a struggle.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be tough. Writing a novel, even your first one, can be a liberating and enjoyable experience. There could be one thing getting in your way.\n\nPlotting.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. How am I supposed to write the next great novel if I don\u2019t have a solid plot? I hate to be the voice of reason in a room of dreamers, but your first book will probably not be great. It will probably be something you write and then hide. Like at the back of the closet or in the attic. It might suck.\n\nThe important thing is not to focus on how great or how bad the novel is. The important thing is finishing the first draft. To do that, we need to remove all the things getting in our way. Like a strict plot and unrealistic expectations.\n\nIn my opinion, unrealistic expectations and over planning are the two biggest things holding you back from finishing a novel.\n\nHow did I figure this out?\n\nIt all started roughly 11 years ago in November. If you are a writer, you can already guess the next line. It was my first NaNoWriMo. If you\u2019re not familiar with NaNoWriMo, it stands for National Novel Writing Month. It\u2019s that special time of year when aspiring authors spend all of their free time and sanity finishing a fifty thousand word novel in November.\n\nI signed up with a group of friends thinking it would be fun. We scheduled weekly times to meet, found bars and cafes for our gatherings, and set up our own little writing group. The problem was, I had no idea what I wanted to write.\n\nI have always been an avid reader, but I was new to writing. So, I talked to the friend who suggested I participate. She told me to try plotting a story. It\u2019s a little embarrassing now to think about, but I didn\u2019t know what plotting was. At that point in my life, I was not a writer. In fact, the last writing class I had was in college. It was an argumentative writing class. We did some basic outlines, but there was no plotting involved.\n\nI ran down to my local bookstore and bought the first book I could find on plotting. I read it over a few days and went through the exercises. By the end of the week I had a plot. Problem solved.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nI remember the first writing event. It was at a small cafe near my apartment in Seattle. I vividly remember starting my first novel with the plotting notebook next to my laptop. I remember opening the notebook and reading what I was supposed to write in the first chapter. I remember the excitement of the story I had created. I also remember the complete disappointment when I wrote. It felt stale. It was a slog. It was definitely not fun.\n\nPhoto by Jackson Simmer on Unsplash\n\nDid I give up?\n\nNo, I finished NaNoWriMo and won my printable certificate declaring me a winner! I didn\u2019t actually finish the story, but I wrote fifty thousand words. That was what was required to win.\n\nUnfortunately, it was complete crap. It was terrible. I tried to read it a few months later and got about two chapters in before stopping and deleting the entire thing.\n\nMost sane people would take that experience and decide writing wasn\u2019t for them. I\u2019m apparently not sane. I followed the one consistent piece of advice I heard from writers. To be a writer, you need to write every day.\n\nI started writing immediately. I wrote about the people on my bus ride home from work. The weird guy who thought it was all right to trim his toenails on the bus was a rather memorable subject. I wrote letters to friends I met during my travels around the world. I wrote about things I wished I could do. Some of it was fiction, and some of it was not. I wrote about whatever came to mind. I wrote, on average, one thousand words a day.\n\nI made it a habit.\n\nI also looked back at my first NaNoWriMo experience and analyzed why it was so terrible. I enjoyed the writing events I went to and the people I met. I enjoyed the plotting experience, but when it came to writing the novel, it was painful.\n\nThen the most obvious thing happened. I compared that experience to my daily writing habit. Guess what I wasn\u2019t doing.\n\nWow, you\u2019re good at this.\n\nYes, you are correct. I wasn\u2019t plotting.\n\nWriting from an outline was a terrible experience for me. It felt like I was tracing rather than drawing. It was no longer creative. It was the opposite. When I wrote without plotting, it was exciting. It was a daily adventure.\n\nSometimes you need to test your beliefs\n\nFast forward 11 years, and I write about four thousand words a day. I write novels and short stories, and have an email list full of people that seems to like what I put out. One thing hasn\u2019t changed. I still don\u2019t plot.\n\nI\u2019m not a financially successful author. I only make a portion of my income from writing fiction, but that amount goes up most months. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m always looking for ways to improve, and about a year ago I was told by an army of authors that the only way to become successful was to plot your stories. They said it was more efficient and made the novels faster to produce. I figured I should try it.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I tried it. Maybe I forgot about my original plotting experience. Perhaps I thought it would be different. I was a better writer after all. Mostly it was me believing the idea that volume of work is vital if you want to be a successful independent author.\n\nFun fact, it isn\u2019t.\n\nSo, I planned out the second book in my recent series. I created new characters like I always did. I created the villains and picked a few locations to use in the book and did my research. Then I started plotting. At first, I just wrote a big summary of what I thought the story should be about. Then I broke it into chapters that fit the structure and story beats I wanted to hit.\n\nWhen I finished, I had a complete story in my mind and on paper that I could follow. I started writing the next day. I hit chapter one hard, and I immediately regretted it. My ordinary four thousand words per day plummeted to around one thousand. After a few days, I was able to get the word count up to approximately two thousand.\n\nMy goal for that book was to complete the first draft in a month and then start the editing and revision process. It took me nearly six weeks to get the first draft done. That might sound fast to you, but I can usually get the first draft of a sixty to eighty thousand word novel done in around four weeks. It killed my productivity.\n\nAfter I finished the first draft I did what I normally do. I let it rest for a day and then started revising. Not only was the book harder to write, it was harder to read. It didn\u2019t flow. I write fast-paced action in either the thriller or fantasy genre. The story I wrote was not fast-paced. Something was missing.\n\nThe adventure was missing. Not the adventure in the story. That was still there buried under a plethora of unnecessary words that I would usually not include. The adventure I had while writing was missing.\n\nWhen I write, I tell myself a story. It\u2019s a story entirely for me. I write what I want to read. I don\u2019t know the ending, and I don\u2019t know what will happen on the next page.\n\nMy fingers race across the keyboard to get to the next action sequence or the next big reveal. As I\u2019m writing, I want to find out where the story is going. I\u2019m writing into the dark, a phrase I first heard in the book Writing Into The Dark by Dean Wesley Smith. If you are familiar with NaNoWriMo, you would call it pantsing.\n\nThere are drawbacks to this style of writing. The first is the first draft might be a lot rougher than you prefer. It might require a lot more editing than something created after plotting. That is not my experience, but that\u2019s something I hear from many who write into the dark. Dean Wesley Smith suggests certain practices that help with this, but that is not the point of this article. Completing your first novel is the point.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re having trouble finishing your first novel, try throwing away the plot you developed. You probably have characters you love. People that live inside your head that you can\u2019t wait to see. Well, grab those characters and throw them into a situation. Get comfortable in your regular writing spot, and just tell yourself a story.",

        "title": "Every Covid-19 Vaccine Question You\u2019ll Ever Have, Answered",
        "text": "Safety\n\nQ: How will I know if the vaccine is really safe?\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that many people have questions or uncertainty about getting a Covid-19 vaccine. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely reasonable to have doubts and concerns,\u201d Greyson said. \u201cWe tell people to question interventions, especially new ones, and this is an intervention, and it\u2019s a new one.\u201d\n\nFurther, the speed at which these vaccines were developed is \u201camazing but understandably can be scary if we don\u2019t understand how they were done faster,\u201d Greyson said. \u201cUsually when we talk about things going fast, they\u2019re rushed, we skip steps. In this situation, that\u2019s not the case, but that hasn\u2019t been effectively communicated to the public.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how we can know steps were not skipped with these vaccines: Every expert on the planet can review the data themselves. In addition to the two committees of independent experts who will review the vaccine data \u2014 VRBPAC at the FDA and ACIP at the CDC \u2014 all the clinical trial data submitted to the FDA and CDC will be made available to the public. Pfizer\u2019s data went public December 8 \u2014 a whopping 92 pages of it. Other experts can read it and raise any red flags they come across. If you don\u2019t know which experts to follow, Omer has a simple rule of thumb: \u201cDo what Fauci says. He\u2019s a shorthand for outside experts.\u201d\n\nSince other countries are reviewing data for the same vaccines, those who don\u2019t feel confident about the FDA or CDC can look to regulatory agencies overseas for their verdicts on the vaccines\u2019 safety.\n\nQ: What kinds of side effects could the vaccine have?\n\nAll vaccines can have reactions and side effects. Side effects are unexpected responses to the vaccine that are uncomfortable or painful but are usually rare. Reactions, especially soreness, swelling, or redness at the injection site, are much more common and are expected to occur in some people after vaccination. Other reactions reported from Covid-19 vaccines include headache, nausea, muscle stiffness, soreness, and aches \u2014 all of which are common with many vaccines.\n\n\u201cThese are not really side effects in the way that we think about them,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cThese are routine reactions that your body has.\u201d\n\nReactions typically occur because of the way vaccines work \u2014 by stimulating the immune system. Illness symptoms like coughing, sneezing, fever, runny nose, and watery eyes are actually the immune system\u2019s response to a pathogen, trying to get rid of it. A fever occurs when the body heats up to help the immune system work more efficiently. Coughing and sneezing are the body\u2019s attempts to literally eject intruders from your body.\n\nTherefore, when these symptoms occur after a vaccine, it\u2019s most often because the vaccine worked (though not necessarily always, as these reactions can occur in placebo groups as well). That is, the vaccine caught the immune system\u2019s attention, and the immune system got to work defending against what it thinks is the real virus.\n\n\u201cThe immune response needs a better public relations team because this is just what happens when you respond to a foreign protein, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,\u201d that the vaccines cause your cells to produce, Offit said. \u201cWhen you respond to a natural infection or you respond to an immunization, your immune system makes a series of proteins that cause side effects. That means you\u2019re having a vigorous immune response.\u201d\n\nSo while these reactions aren\u2019t pleasant for many\u2014and downright miserable for some\u2014the good news is that they usually mean your immune system is working well. It\u2019s also why many people feel tired or worn out for a few days after getting a vaccine: Your body used up a lot of energy fighting a serious threat (or so the immune system believed it to be).\n\nMost people experienced only mild or moderate reactions, if any, from the Moderna vaccine, but the company hasn\u2019t yet released its complete data on side effects, so it cannot be compared to the Pfizer vaccine right now. Moderna did report numbers for severe adverse events: about 2% developed high fevers (102\u00baF\u2013104\u00baF) and severe chills. Other severe Moderna vaccine reactions included severe fatigue (10% of participants), muscle pain (9%), joint pain (5%), and headache (5%). Likely a much higher percentage experienced mild or moderate versions of those side effects, but we won\u2019t know until the company releases the full data.\n\nWith the Pfizer vaccine, the younger participants were, the more commonly they reported similar reactions: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Among the small data set of 100 adolescents aged 12\u201315, for example, 14% experienced a fever after the first dose, and 20% experienced one after the second dose, compared to 1% and 11% in older adults (over age 55). It\u2018s not necessarily surprising that older adults would experience fewer reactions than younger people since reactions usually result from how strongly the immune system responds; the older you get, the less efficiently your immune system responds to threats.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse events with the Pfizer vaccine were headache (42% of participants with the first dose and 52% with the second) and fatigue (27% and 59%), which also occurred in the placebo group, though at lower rates. One common theme that occurred across all ages was a stronger reaction to the second Pfizer dose than the first. A majority of participants reported pain at the injection site with both doses. But more than half of participants of all ages felt fatigued after the second dose, and high numbers experienced headaches as well. In those aged 16\u201355, more than a third experienced chills and/or muscle pain, and the numbers were only slightly lower in those over age 55. A small proportion of participants (less than 1%) experienced severe fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, or fever with the first dose, and only slightly more (2% or less) had these severe reactions with the second dose, except 3.8% who had severe fatigue with the second dose.\n\nThe adverse reactions reported in the AstraZeneca vaccine trials are similar\u2014fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, nausea, joint pain, or generally feeling crummy\u2014though complete phase 3 data are not available yet. One severe adverse event occurred in the AstraZeneca trial: a person developed transverse myelitis (an inflammation of the spinal cord) 2 weeks after getting the second dose, though researchers could not determine if it was related to the vaccine or not. The person recovered and remained in the trial. Not enough data from other vaccine candidates are available yet, but they\u2019re likely to be similar unless an unexpected adverse event is found.\n\nIf you get a Covid-19 vaccine, odds are high that you\u2019ll have a sore arm. In addition, some people will have severe swelling at the injection site, and others will feel knocked flat for a day or two, as though they\u2019ve gotten sick, especially after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. They haven\u2019t gotten sick or been given Covid, but their immune system doesn\u2019t realize that and has gone into overdrive to protect the body. It\u2019s helpful to be prepared in case you\u2019re among the unlucky ones who has a severe reaction, but know that it passes within 1\u20133 days. Some experts recommend that people plan for stronger reactions to the second dose by getting it on a Friday or taking off work the next day.\n\nSo far, none of the vaccines have shown more serious reactions or side effects than these in the trials, but two people in the United Kingdom did experience severe allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. (See the next question.) Researchers will continue to look for adverse events in trial participants for several years, and the CDC has several surveillance systems to look for and respond to vaccine safety concerns in the general public.\n\nQ: After the severe allergic reactions seen in two U.K. vaccine recipients, should I avoid the vaccine if I\u2019ve ever had a severe allergic reaction to anything?\n\nEarly in the Pfizer vaccination program in the U.K., two people experienced serious allergic reactions after receiving the vaccine. Both recovered, and both had a previous history of serious allergies that led them to carry adrenaline shots (EpiPens). U.K. regulators have since suggested that others with a history of serious allergic reactions should not get the vaccine, but that broad recommendation may be premature, explained Offit.\n\n\u201cI think that was an unfortunate move on the U.K.\u2019s part because I think it just scared people unnecessarily,\u201d Offit said. \u201cI think it would have been more reasonable to actually look a little more carefully at those two patients to see what component, if any, in that vaccine caused an allergic reaction.\u201d\n\nHopefully, scientists in the U.K. are investigating those reactions further, and the U.K. authorities may revise their recommendation after learning more. After the vaccines receive approval in the U.S., the CDC\u2019s ACIP committee will include in its recommendations which groups should not get the vaccine.\n\nQ: What about long-term side effects that we don\u2019t know about yet?\n\nIt\u2019s rare for a vaccine to have any side effects more than two weeks after getting it, but there are a few instances that have occurred with past vaccines. The 1976 swine flu vaccine had an increased risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), a nerve disorder (one case per 100,000 people vaccinated). The seasonal flu vaccine has been linked to a small increased risk of GBS as well some years, but it\u2019s in the neighborhood of one or two cases per million, and the risk of GBS from influenza infection is several times higher. Another example is the rotavirus vaccine, which was linked to a very slight increased risk of intussusception, a bowel problem that sometimes requires surgery to treat. One of the H1N1 flu vaccines distributed exclusively in Europe had an added ingredient to enhance the immune system, called an adjuvant, that was linked to increased risk of narcolepsy.\n\nAll of these longer-term, rarer side effects occurred within a few months of the vaccine and were picked up quickly by vaccine safety surveillance systems. Many of the mRNA trial participants have already been vaccinated for up to four months. No U.S.-approved vaccine has shown serious long-term effects more than a few months after vaccination, and it\u2019s difficult to determine a biological reason that might happen. Companies needed at least two months of follow-up to apply for an EUA from the FDA, and by the time a vaccine is available for you, many more months will have passed when researchers gathered more data.\n\nIt\u2019s valid and reasonable to have questions about possible long-term effects that occur several months after a Covid-19 vaccine, so researchers and regulatory officials are closely monitoring vaccine recipients to look for any. Continue to follow the news as the vaccines roll out to find out if any long-term effects get reported, but based on the history of vaccines in general, it\u2019s not likely they will.\n\nQ: Are there any medications that would interact with a Covid-19 vaccine?\n\nIn the data reported thus far, researchers haven\u2019t found any interactions with other medications in the clinical trials. However, all of the trials except one (Janssen) excluded people who are taking immunosuppressing or immune-modifying drugs, such as those commonly prescribed for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The trials also excluded people who are taking anticoagulant (anti-clotting) and antiplatelet medications. That means no safety or effectiveness data is available for people in those groups. When the CDC makes its recommendations, it will specify if people taking any specific medications or undergoing specific therapies should avoid vaccination.\n\nQ: Is the vaccine safe for children? When will they be able to get it?\n\nVaccines must be shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective in children before the FDA will allow their use in children or the CDC will recommend them. Pfizer has begun testing in children aged 12 and older, and Moderna recently announced plans to test its vaccine in 3,000 teens. If those trials go well, they may go on to conduct trials in younger children, following a pattern typical in drug and vaccine trials in general.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re first tested in adults, then older children and adolescents, and we kind of work our way down to younger and younger children,\u201d Moss said. It\u2019s unclear when the other companies will begin testing in children, but it will only occur after there is adequate safety data in adults. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that by the school term of fall 2021, we will certainly have a vaccine we can administer to children over 12, and I think we have a good shot of having a vaccine for even younger children as well,\u201d Moss said.\n\nQ: How can I be sure that the process of the vaccine\u2019s development and approval wasn\u2019t inappropriately influenced by political interests?\n\nAfter evidence surfaced of the Trump administration\u2019s meddling at the CDC and given criticism of the administration pressuring the FDA to grant an EUA to hydroxychloroquine (which was later revoked), it\u2019s reasonable to have concerns about political influence in the Covid vaccine development process. Fortunately, several safeguards in the vaccine approval process \u2014 even for an EUA \u2014 are reassuring.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I point out is that yes, there have been instances [in the history of vaccine development] where scientists have been unethical, and these safeguards are in place to really limit the ability of any one scientist in being unethical,\u201d said Andrasik.\n\nTwo of the biggest safeguards are the VRBPAC and ACIP committees, both of which are made up of independent experts who are not employees of the FDA or the CDC and both of which hold open meetings available to the public. For example, President Trump issued an ultimatum to the FDA on Dec. 11, demanding that the agency approve the Pfizer vaccine or he would fire FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, a move hardly reassuring to those who want the agency to make its decisions without political pressure. However, by that point, the vaccine had already been approved by the UK\u2019s regulatory agency and had been reviewed by VRBPAC, which found its data on safety and effectiveness strong enough to recommend the FDA issue an EUA. The FDA nearly always follows VRBPAC recommendations, and the President has no ability to influence VRBPAC\u2019s independent members.\n\nIn addition, every vaccine trial has an independent safety monitoring board responsible for overseeing the safety of the trial. You may have heard of some vaccine trials that were paused while an adverse event was investigated. That means the process is working: If someone has a heart attack, the trial stops vaccinating new participants until the study leaders can determine if the heart attack could have been related to the vaccine. Once it\u2019s determined that a serious medical event is not related to the vaccine, the trials resume.\n\nFinally, look to regulatory agencies outside the U.S., Greyson said. \u201cI think something that we in the United States lose sight of is that many, many other countries around the world are also assessing Covid-19 vaccines, and if you\u2019re worried about whether you can trust your own country\u2019s institutions, you can look at other countries to see if they\u2019re also approving those vaccines,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they are, you can have more confidence that the approval wasn\u2019t made inappropriately or under political pressure.\u201d\n\nQ: Will any other authorities be looking at the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine besides the FDA and CDC?\n\nYes. In addition to the United Kingdom\u2019s recent approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine \u2014 the first country to approve a well-tested Covid-19 vaccine and begin vaccinating the public \u2014 the U.K. will likely approve the AstraZeneca vaccine developed with Oxford University next. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is reviewing the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines applications, both submitted December 1, and has begun a \u201crolling review\u201d of the Janssen vaccine. Health Canada has also begun a rolling review of the Janssen vaccine and is reviewing data for three other vaccine candidates. Australia, New Zealand, India, and other countries are also reviewing data for the Pfizer vaccine, and others developed in the U.S.\n\nQ: What happens if I do have a really serious reaction to a Covid vaccine? Will I be compensated?\n\nVery severe reactions to a vaccine are extremely rare, but that doesn\u2019t mean they never happen. Under the Public Readiness & Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP), the federal government has taken into account the possibility that emergency measures to address the pandemic \u2014 including vaccines used with an EUA \u2014 could potentially cause unforeseen harm. The PREP Act, therefore, includes the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), which may provide benefits, such as medical expenses, lost employment income, benefits to the estate or survivor death benefits, to those who experience an injury and file for the benefits.\n\nAfter any Covid-19 vaccines receive full FDA approval, they will no longer fall under the CICP program, but they will fall under a very similar one called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP). The NVICP provides compensation to people who experience an injury due to a vaccine. The NVICP is a no-fault system, which means if it\u2019s biologically plausible that the vaccine caused the injury, or it\u2019s a known injury that can occur in extremely rare circumstances from the vaccine (less than one in several million doses), the person receives compensation without having to prove the vaccine caused the injury and without the vaccine manufacturer being found at fault for a faulty vaccine. You can learn more about the differences between NVICP and CICP here.",

        "title": "Set Up Your Real Time Chat App On Amazon EC2 With Docker and FeathersJS",
        "text": "Introduction\n\nAmazon AWS is a service where you can borrow a machine (sometimes for free) to do whatever you want. We are going to learn how to set up a server to run a real time Chat App with FeathersJS. FeathersJS is an open source REST and real time API framework.We will need to set up a database and Feathers. We will launch those 2 parts on your Amazon AWS service. This is a simple tutorial, where we will learn how to run your real time app on your Amazon AWS.\n\nConnect to Amazon Web Service, and create an account, this is maybe the most time consuming task!\n\nCreate a free AWS EC2 instance and SSH\n\nConnect to your Amazon AWS profile\n\nSelect menu -> products -> compute -> Amazon EC2 -> get started with Amazon EC 2 (It is completely free)\n\nClick on EC2 Dashboard on the left and then launch instance\n\nSelect Ubuntu server and choose the Free Tier Eligible T2.micro, then click on Next until you reach the security step\n\nWe need 2 network rules, the ssh rule on port 22, source custom and the custom tcp, port range 3000, source anywhere, then launch your instance ! This step is important to reveal the port 3000 to the world on tcp, and the port 22 on ssh.\n\nThis step is extremely important to connect to your EC2 machine ! Choose to create a new key pair, name your key pair webApp, and download it, then view instance. Congratulations, you have launched your Amazon AWS instance. The next step is to try to connect to this instance.\n\nThis step is for linux / mac users, if you have a windows, please follow this link. Create a directory called webApp, and put the webApp.pem in it (if you are a mac user, you may have downloaded a webApp.pem.txt, rename it webApp.pem), navigate inside this directory using bash, then run :\n\n> chmod 400 webApp.pem\n\nto modify the rights on the key.\n\n> ssh -i \u201cwebApp.pem\u201d ubuntu@name_of_your_ubuntu_instance\n\nYou can find the right command by connecting to the Amazon AWS website, and click on the connect button. A pop-up will appear with the right ssh command. For me for instance, it is going to be :\n\n> ssh -i \"webApp.pem\" ubuntu@ec2-54-186-155-245.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\nCongratulations, most of the dirty work is done by now ! The aim is to be pretty simple, and help you set up your machine.\n\nInstall Docker\n\nNow, we need to install Docker on your ec2 machine. Docker runs \u201ckind of\u201d virtual machine which are called images, but are way lighter than virtual machines. Docker will allow you to run all the bricks of your app with a simple command line ! The good thing about Docker is that it encapsulates all the software you may need. This is precisely what we want to do when we run an app, we wrap the different components of our architecture in containers.\n\nTo install docker, you can type on your ec2 terminal the following commands :\n\n> curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n\n> sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\"\n\n> sudo apt-get update\n\n> apt-cache policy docker-ce\n\n> sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce\n\n> sudo systemctl status docker\n\nThe last command is to make sure that docker is installed.\n\nInstall Feathers, Get And Launch The Chat App\n\nTo install Feathers, and download the app, we will simply pull a Docker image. That is where the magic resides. There is already a Docker image with Feathers installed and the real time chat app coded. We will use this ready to use image, and deploy it to amazon. You can then quit your shell, and the AWS instance will still be running your app ! Let\u2019s try.\n\nRun the following command :\n\n> sudo docker pull kevbac/feathers-chat\n\nNow we need to create a folder and bind it to the docker container. For instance, navigate to your webapp folder and run :\n\n> sudo docker run -itd -p 3000:8080 -v ~/webapp:/home --name feathersChatApp kevbac/feathers-chat bash -c \"npm start\"\n\nYou can notice that the folder is empty, but the app is running! You can copy the content of the docker container to your host machine with this command:\n\n> sudo docker cp feathersChatApp:/usr/src/app .\n\nWe now run in a detached mode \u201cnpm start\u201d, you can use \u201cyarn start\u201d as well. This means that in the background, we have a process keeping our chat app alive! We can now access to our EC2 Amazon machine through HTTP.

        "title": "7 Things Highly Productive People Don\u2019t Do",
        "text": "7 Things Highly Productive People Don\u2019t Do\n\nThey understand that time is limited.\n\nPhoto by Toni Koraza on Unsplash\n\nYou can travel the world, write books, start businesses, and retire by the time you\u2019re 35.\n\nPeople that run 10 companies from a Yacht in the Mediterranean are real.\n\nThe good news is that you can be one of those founders with 10 companies and more free time than a toddler. The ideas and concepts are easy to understand. I\u2019ve published 300+stories, wrote a novel, traveled 6 months this year, started a Medium publication and a digital agency in London, and lost 20 pounds while never having to lose a single second from my social life.\n\nHowever, most people will never dare to take control of their time.\n\nFocus on getting the right stuff done to achieve more in less time.\n\n1. Highly productive people don\u2019t create unnecessary conflict.\n\nI\u2019d rather wash the dishes myself every day than have to discuss who\u2019s house chore it\u2019s supposed to be that day.\n\nTaking 10 minutes out of your day to avoid an unnecessary conflict feels good and keeps your mind focused on what\u2019s important. Trust me, dishes are everything but important. And cleaning can be quite therapeutic. I\u2019ve cut down on friction at home by simply taking the whole task for myself. Mutual respect is essential for any co-living and co-working environment, but sometimes picking your battles can free more mental bandwidth for what is important to you.\n\nAnd the dishes are rarely that important.\n\n2. Highly productive people don\u2019t fall out of the blue on every task.\n\nMy writing routine jumped to another level when I started annotating my plans and images.\n\nYou can create mental maps and timestamps about any of your plans and tasks. With free tools like Good Annotations, you can simply snap your screen and add text to it for later use. Also, design your workflow, how-to images, and product templates with simple annotation tools.\n\nGood annotation skills made a difference between writing a single article and writing two in the same time-frame.\n\n3. Highly productive people don\u2019t tease themselves with things they might regret later.\n\nKnow yourself.\n\nAre you one of those all-in addictive personalities, like most people?\n\nMy life changed when I just stopped trying to self-contain myself around personal vices. I know I can\u2019t just smoke socially, and that trying to smoke only a few cigarettes a week leads to eventually buying a pack every day. I don\u2019t entertain myself with only one beer because I know that it might lead to a wild party and a hangover the next day.\n\nKnow yourself, and don\u2019t push the wrong buttons when you\u2019re trying to stay productive.\n\n4. Highly productive people don\u2019t indulge in random distractions.\n\nI don\u2019t entertain myself with only 10min of YouTube in the middle of my workflow.\n\nI know YouTube binge will probably take an hour, and I\u2019ll feel frustrated with myself later on. Focus on the task at hand until you reach the flow-state. When you\u2019re chasing the next task just for the sake of getting it out, it is a telltale sign that you\u2019re in the flow-state. Your work becomes self-sustaining, and you want it only for itself.\n\nWho you\u2019re working for and why you\u2019re doing it is not as important as getting it done.\n\n5. Highly productive people don\u2019t create unattainable goals in short time frames.\n\nInstead, develop long-term systems and chase short-term goals. My shift from working for a boss to being a self-sustaining entrepreneur comes from systems and not goals. I decided to write every day and publish every day.\n\nI wrote 15min every morning until I had a 300-page novel in my hands. I study languages daily with 15min tasks and can communicate in 5 languages, and speak two fluently.\n\n6. Highly productive people don\u2019t overstuff their schedule.\n\nHow many nights did you go to bed with the plans to change the world the next morning?\n\nI did that most of my student days. Some something happens within your brain right before you fall to sleep. The doors of immense creativity open, everything seems possible, and you suddenly know how to fix everything. My plans fell short from the reality of the next day. I was still the same person, and now I felt unaccomplished because of all these unrealistic ideas I had planned for the day.\n\nMotivation plays a key role in staying productive, and having a real to-do list is essential to win the day.\n\n7. Highly productive people forgive themselves when they fail.\n\nDwelling on your mistakes and bathing in self-pity is the surefire way not to accomplish anything for the day.\n\nYour life is full of bad and good karma, and you can choose what you focus on. Focusing on salvaging, damage-control, and proactive approach has helped me overcome the worst days. I know I can\u2019t perform at my best and realize all my plans exactly how I imagine them in my head. And that is fine.\n\nForgive yourself.\n\nYou can always make more money, but you can\u2019t ever get the time back.\n\nHighly productive people understand that time is the only commodity that is limited for everyone. You\u2019re getting more of your life for yourself by staying productive and using more time within your hours. I\u2019m buying time now.\n\nOnce you run out of time, you can\u2019t ever get it back.",

        "title": "When Should You Quit?",
        "text": "Quitting has a negative association. We describe it as giving up, being non-committal, or lacking perseverance. When someone quits, it\u2019s easy to assume that the person simply didn\u2019t give it their all.\n\nTo be sure, quitting prematurely happens too often. Whenever you try something, you\u2019re going to have difficulties. You\u2019re going to face obstacles. You\u2019re going to battle doubts swimming in your head. Quitting may not be the best choice.\n\nBut other times, it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep going. What if you attempt something, but never see any progress? What if you continue down a route, but just don\u2019t feel passionate about where you\u2019re headed?\n\nHow do you know when it\u2019s time to buckle down, and when to let go?\n\nTwo Friends With a Shared Dream\n\nIn 1973 on Long Island, two seventh grade boys met in gym class and became friends. Over the years, their friendship continued until twelfth grade rolled around. Then, it was time for the two to go their separate ways for college.\n\nBen Cohen went off to Colgate University and then spent the following summer working at an ice cream truck. In his second year, he dropped out and moved back to Long Island, where he worked menial jobs while attending jewelry and pottery courses at various universities. Before the decade was over, he worked as a cashier, a deliverer, a floor cleaner, a taxi driver, a guard, and an assistant superintendent.\n\nJerry Greenfield, on the other hand, was a diligent student. After high school, he chose to study pre-med at Oberlin College. As a side job, he scooped ice cream for students at the cafeteria.\n\nAfter graduation, Greenfield applied to medical school and was rejected twice. He then moved back to New York, where he shared an apartment with Cohen while working as a lab technician. For the third and final time, he applied to medical school.\n\nAfter his rejection, he moved to North Carolina to continue as a lab technician. A couple years later, he decided to move up to Saratoga Springs, New York to room with Cohen again. This time, they considered doing something together.\n\nBoth of them had always wanted to run a business. So they turned to ice cream. After spending five dollars on an ice-cream making correspondence course (they split the tuition), and a $12,000 investment, they opened shop.\n\nThe Question At the Back of Our Minds\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s was a success. From that single shop in Burlington, Vermont, they\u2019ve since expanded across the world. But how did they know that opening an ice cream shop was the right decision to make? How did they know to stick with it?\n\nThe answer: By quitting numerous things beforehand.\n\nNow, that may sound overly simplistic. It sounds as if they just knew when to quit, and when to keep going. But what is simple should never be confused with what is easy.\n\nOpening an ice cream shop with a correspondence course and start-up capital is simple enough. But knowing what they needed and didn\u2019t need to focus on wasn\u2019t. While they started their business venture, there were other options in their lives \u2014 options where they said \u201cno\u201d.\n\nWhenever we start something, there\u2019s always that question at the back of our minds: Should we keep going?\n\nFor instance, if your business is suffering losses, you may be at a crossroads on whether or not to call it a day. If you keep applying to grad school and get rejected, you start to second-guess your qualifications. If you fall behind people who started learning a skill at the same time, you wonder whether your talent lies somewhere else.\n\nHow to Know When It\u2019s Time to Quit\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether to keep going or pursue something else, consider these points. Do any of them resonate with you?\n\n1. You don\u2019t see a light at the end of the tunnel\n\nWhen you don\u2019t see things getting better, or you stagnate despite multiple approaches, it might be time to consider quitting. For instance, you keep running in the same arguments with somebody, or you always seem to get skipped over for promotion.\n\nAn interesting part of the Ben & Jerry\u2019s story is that Ben Cohen suffers from severe anosmia. He cannot taste or smell. To compensate for his lack of taste perception, he put large chunks into the ice cream to feel the texture. The large chunks have since become a trademark.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to start a food business if you can\u2019t smell. But Cohen managed to turn his weakness into an advantage, which shows one of the biggest differences between a temporary setback and a permanent one.\n\nA temporary setback involves hitting difficulties, but still having a pathway towards where you\u2019re headed. Even if there are obstacles, they\u2019re manageable and can be overcome. It may have helped that Cohen had a business partner who could taste and smell at his side.\n\nA permanent setback happens when you\u2019re faced with an insurmountable problem. The probability of progressing further is low and possibly decreasing with time. Maybe you want to pursue a career with age or physical restrictions and your chances of succeeding go down with time.\n\nIn Greenfield\u2019s case, he was rejected from medical school three times. It\u2019s hard to say whether he would have been accepted eventually. But in any case, he decided he\u2019d had enough and moved on to other projects.\n\n2. The pain is greater than the reward\n\nIf doing something makes you feel physically or mentally ill, it\u2019s time to take a step back and evaluate. Putting up with pain takes its toll in the long term to the point that it becomes unbearable.\n\nHow do you know whether your pain comes from doing something you dislike, or because you work too hard on something you want? After all, author Margaret Atwood developed spinal neurosis from writing too much. She worked on her craft to the point that she became physically ill.\n\nI think the difference was that, for Atwood, the reward of writing was greater than its downside. She saw value in continuing to write, despite the injuries and discomforts. She was compelled to write, no matter what happened.\n\nBut if you dread doing something or going somewhere, you have to assess the value in continuing. Is the reward worth the pain? After all, by staying in one endeavor, there\u2019s an opportunity cost. Trade-offs are involved.\n\nWe\u2019re often hesitant to quit because of the \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d. The more time, energy, and resources we invest, the harder it becomes to walk away. This is why it makes sense to quickly test out an idea before spending too much on it.\n\nIn Cohen and Greenfield\u2019s case, they considered running a bagel shop, but learned from a bagel-making equipment supplier that the start-up costs were too high for their budget.\n\n3. You stay because there\u2019s nothing else out there\n\nThere are many reasons why we stay in one place. Believing there are no other options is the wrong one. Still, it\u2019s easy to close yourself to new ideas when you fall into a routine. After a while, daily habits become difficult to change.\n\nExperiencing routine brings both comfort for sameness and an increasing discomfort for the unfamiliar. As time drags on, it may seem like the only set of options available are the ones put in front of us. For instance, when a restaurant hands you a menu with five choices, how often do you ask the server about a sixth choice?\n\nWe usually opt for what we see. It may not be what we want, but it\u2019s convenient. This isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Sometimes, we just need to pick something and get on with our day.\n\nBut for more important choices, this scarcity mindset can lead to a dead end. It could mean staying in a job with no prospects, or pursuing an idea with little chance of taking off. We stay simply because we think that we have no choice.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been stuck in this frame of mind, experiencing something different can widen your perspective. For Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, moving to a new town and teaming up gave them the courage to pursue an idea.\n\n4. Your current path doesn\u2019t align with your values\n\nBefore Ben & Jerry\u2019s was created, Ben Cohen was a cab driver and potter with no one who wanted to buy his pottery. Jerry Greenfield was working with animal brains in a research lab. Neither of them was particularly interested in what they were doing.\n\nOnce they got together, they brainstormed what they liked. It had always been a dream of theirs to start a business. Looking back, they realized that they wanted to incorporate their love of eating.\n\nThe two also shared a good sense of humor. The first time they met, the coach yelled that if they didn\u2019t run a mile in under seven minutes, they would have to keep trying. Cohen retorted, \u201cGee coach, if I don\u2019t do it under seven minutes the first time, I\u2019m certainly not going to do it in under seven minutes the second time!\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, they wanted their business to be fun and spirited. Later, the company became a platform for fair trade and environmental issues.\n\nThere are many reasons why we decide to do something. Sometimes, social pressure influences what we choose to pursue. Other times, we fulfill others\u2019 expectations by stepping into a pre-determined path. Possibly, Greenfield had applied to medical school out of expectation rather than desire.\n\nIt takes time to find out what you value. You could value independence, creativity, or the outdoors, for instance. There are some values that you place higher than others. You may still be sorting out your values. But once you find them, like Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, it becomes obvious.\n\nIf Things Aren\u2019t Working, Pivot\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy decision to drop something and start afresh. It\u2019s even harder to know what to quit and how to go about it.\n\nSometimes you don\u2019t need to quit what you\u2019re doing, but you need to quit your expectations. Ben & Jerry\u2019s didn\u2019t set out to become a global enterprise. They just started by selling ice cream out of a renovated gas station.\n\nSometimes, you don\u2019t need to quit your expectations, but you do need to quit your approach. It\u2019s not impossible to start an ice cream company if you have anosmia, but you need to find a way around it.\n\nAnd other times, you might be headed in the wrong direction altogether. Like Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, you won\u2019t get things right from the beginning. You\u2019ll have to make things up as you go along.\n\nBut if you keep exploring and adjusting, quitting in one thing may be the necessary ingredient to succeeding in another.\n\nMelissa Chu writes about creating great work and successful habits at JumpstartYourDreamLife.com.

        "title": "The Cold Mountain Effect Explains Why Incredibly Talented People Struggle to Achieve Their Goals",
        "text": "The Cold Mountain Effect Explains Why Incredibly Talented People Struggle to Achieve Their Goals\n\nDon\u2019t be too good for your own good.\n\nPhoto by Trace Hudson from Pexels\n\nShe was too smart. I mean that.\n\n\u201cYou should try reading Shakespeare in German,\u201d she told me once. \u201cIt\u2019s funny as hell. You\u2019d get a kick out of it.\u201d\n\nShe paused.\n\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019ll have to learn German first\u2026\u201d\n\nThis kind of thing would usually irritate me. But my friend wasn\u2019t trying to show off. She was just being her brainiac self.\n\nShe was the smartest girl I ever met. She knew four languages, not counting Old English \u2014 or the Japanese she picked up from living in Tokyo. Given all of this, you might wonder why it took her almost ten years to finish her PhD, more than twice as long as her friends.\n\nI told you.\n\nShe was too smart.\n\nMy friend didn\u2019t struggle with the usual problems.\n\nShe didn\u2019t hate her job. She didn\u2019t procrastinate. Over the years, she wrote hundreds of pages for her dissertation.\n\nShe loved spending all day (and night) in the library.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t shy.\n\nShe was downright charming. You could go out for coffee with her and come back feeling like a different person.\n\nShe made everyone around her smarter.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have problems with confidence, or getting dates. Somehow she managed to live a full life, just stitching together gigs and living that photogenic minimalist lifestyle.\n\nShe eventually found someone who appreciated her brains, along with everything else she had to offer.\n\nShe just couldn\u2019t finish her dissertation.\n\nSome people are too good for their own good.\n\nMy friend isn\u2019t the only incredibly talented person who took an extra long time to accomplish something.\n\nRemember the novel Cold Mountain?\n\nIt made history in 1997 with a 61-week run on the New York Times best-seller list, moving 3 million copies.\n\nBased on its success, Charles Frazier got an $8 million deal for his second book, with nothing more than a 1-page proposal. Cold Mountain swept the award scene that year, and went on to become a hit film that earned seven Academy Award nominations.\n\nSometimes it takes an intervention.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t know that Frazier spent almost a decade working on Cold Mountain. According to lore, he couldn\u2019t stop.\n\nOne of his friends finally snuck an unfinished copy of the manuscript to a literary agent, who signed Frazier on the spot. That\u2019s the only reason anyone knows anything about Charles Frazier. It\u2019s hard to imagine how long he would\u2019ve kept revising it.\n\nFrazier didn\u2019t lack confidence.\n\nIt would be easy to say Frazier just didn\u2019t have confidence in his work, or that he suffered from imposter syndrome.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t explain everything. If Charles Frazier lacked confidence, he wouldn\u2019t have quit his job as an English teacher to finish working on the book. He had to believe in it on some level.\n\nFrazier\u2019s problem was that he was just too good at what he did. He loved doing it too much. It\u2019s a strange problem to think about, but not as rare as you think. We all know someone who has the same issue. There\u2019s a chance you are that person. And if you\u2019re not, there\u2019s even better news: There\u2019s absolutely no reason to be jealous.\n\nThe Cold Mountain Effect explains what we mistake as perfectionism.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, which explains why incompetent people think they\u2019re so smart. It\u2019s where we get that saying, \u201cA little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\u201d\n\nThe Cold Mountain Effect explains the opposite.\n\nSomeone can know too much. They can be too talented. They\u2019ll turn any project into an epic journey through the Himalayas. They don\u2019t get tired of working. They don\u2019t want to see the end. They\u2019re not even perfectionists. They just love their work too much.\n\nBeware of The Cold Mountain Effect.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be like Charles Frazier.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun story. Most of us look at his career with a mix of awe and envy. But here\u2019s the thing. You probably don\u2019t have a friend who\u2019s going to conduct a secret operation to show your unfinished project to their literary agent, or some angel investor. We have to advocate for ourselves.\n\nFor every Charles Frazier, there\u2019s hundreds of incredibly talented people who never learn how to finish their work and leave it alone. They never know when to say, \u201cIt\u2019s good enough.\u201d\n\nThey wait for someone else to tell them.\n\nYou have to climb down from Cold Mountain.\n\nAnyone can get stuck on Cold Mountain. We can turn our goals into an endless climb. The question is, why?\n\nWe\u2019re perfectly capable of accomplishing what we want. We\u2019ve even done it. We\u2019ve finished the ascent. But we refuse to plant the flag. We stay just below the summit, because we don\u2019t want to climb down.\n\nIt feels good to be close to your goals.\n\nAlmost done feels better than actually done. We see the top. Instead of pushing our way there, we linger.\n\nTalented people fear success more than failure.\n\nAlmost nobody\u2019s afraid of failure anymore. We\u2019ve seen enough ads. We\u2019ve read enough articles about it.\n\nFailure is old news.\n\nSuccess, that\u2019s the scary part. Most of us don\u2019t have the first clue what to do when we achieve something.\n\nAccomplishing goals usually doesn\u2019t bring the euphoria we expect. If it does, the sensation never lasts too long. It leads to more pressure and expectations. After extraordinary success, some people even sink into an abyss of depression. They start abusing drugs and alcohol. They just don\u2019t know what else to do with themselves. They chase the high they thought their enormous success would bring them.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to fear enormous success.\n\nEvery few months you see a story about some dude who sells his company for billions of dollars. Instead of enjoying it, he falls into an existential crisis. We\u2019ve seen the same story with everyone from famous authors to word-class athletes and musicians. That fate scares incredibly talented people more than anything, even if they don\u2019t know it.\n\nBut it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nOur odds of enjoying that level of success are so small, it\u2019s not worth the worry. It\u2019s way more likely that we\u2019ll spend a lifetime never accomplishing our first big goals, even though we could.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to fear a thud, either.\n\nIncredibly talented people fear one thing even more than enormous success that puts more pressure on them.\n\nThey\u2019re afraid of the thud.\n\nA thud isn\u2019t a failure. A thud is a success that doesn\u2019t live up to your expectations by any measure. It doesn\u2019t bring the high. It doesn\u2019t bring the money or attention you craved, either.\n\nWhen someone thuds, their book or album or startup just does pretty well. Incredibly talented people are secretly terrified of this, too. They think if they sink an enormous amount of time and energy into something and it doesn\u2019t pay off with early retirement or a Nobel Prize, then their life is over, and they\u2019ll never make anything again.\n\nThis is wrong, too.\n\nYou can\u2019t live at the top of Cold Mountain.\n\nWhen you finish something, you have to start something else. Or you have to take a break and figure out what\u2019s next.\n\nThat\u2019s often the hardest part for smart, talented people. They don\u2019t like hangovers that follow achievement. They die by comparing themselves to their own potential. They try to outdo themselves.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nThey try to write Cold Mountain, every single time.\n\nThe solution is to stop caring so much.\n\nThe most satisfied and emotionally stable artists and content creators don\u2019t spend years sweating over a single piece of work, even if they pretend that it\u2019s what they\u2019d rather be doing.\n\nAfter Cold Mountain, Charles Frazier went on to publish three more books. None of them did as well as his first. It doesn\u2019t matter. You might even say it\u2019s impossible to top that kind of success.\n\nWhat matters is that he learned how to put his work out there, and stopped relying on people to steal his work.\n\nDon\u2019t be too good for your own good.\n\nMy friend eventually let go of her dissertation. She defended a few years ago, well after most of her friends had finished and gotten tenure-track jobs, many of which she was overqualified for.\n\nShe\u2019d written almost a thousand pages, and hundreds of footnotes. Deciding what to submit became a project of its own. Now she\u2019s married with a kid, and a decent job. She\u2019s still too smart and talented for her own good, but she doesn\u2019t let that get in her way anymore.\n\nNeither should you.\n\nWhen you\u2019re incredibly smart and talented, you have a different struggle. You have to let yourself stop when the work feels okay.\n\nBecause your version of okay is mind-blowing.",

        "title": "Writer\u2019s Bling Block: How Your First Recognition Can Kill Your Writing",
        "text": "Photo by Jp Valery on Unsplash\n\nWith the exception of the great composers, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo, an artist\u2019s talent is not often immediately seen. They have to start from the ground up \u2014 no, the basement. They have to pound the pavement whether they be a painter, singer, dancer, actor, or in this case, a writer.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there, the burgeoning excitement as you open an envelope, hoping that maybe, just maybe there is an acceptance rather than a rejection slip inside. Unless you\u2019re like Stephen King who posted such slips all over his writing wall \u2014 you, the writers who are reading this, are no doubt familiar with that disappointment.\n\nBut I\u2019m not here to talk about that.\n\nI\u2019m here to talk about the paralyzing pressure that takes over after the sea of disappointment gives way to the one pearl of hope: An acceptance letter, perhaps accompanied by a fat wad of cash depending on where you publish. Life is good! You, the amazing connoisseur of the pen and keyboard, have finally achieved the impossible! You have been paid for your writing! If Johnny Depp proposed to you on top of the London Eye, it wouldn\u2019t even compare to how self-satisfied you are now! You spit out words, and somebody paid for them! You are a Queen, a King, a demigod of scribes! You are amazing! You are on your way! You are \u2014\n\nnow under 10,000 metric tons of pressure to write something just as good, immediately.\n\nYou start off being generous to yourself, that\u2019s how the deterioration begins.\n\n\u201cI feel like writing about this, and if these people liked that one piece, they ought to like this one.\u201d\n\nOr you can sometimes be a victim of the cocky approach.\n\n\u201cThat last piece flowed so easily. I can do it again whenever I want. I\u2019ve got some money put away now \u2014 I can rest and maybe go watch some Netflix.\u201d\n\nYou do watch Netflix, but you can\u2019t seem to relax as the newly published jitters are vibrating in your veins like a thousand bees. That paycheck is burning a hole in your pocket, but no, you have to save it. Maybe you just got lucky. You don\u2019t know where your next big hit is coming from.\n\nYou tear yourself away from your celebratory cookie dough and The Walking Dead, envisioning your career crawling toward you, lifeless and taunting like one of the many zombies on screen. You can\u2019t stand it anymore. This check is not a guarantee. You must keep writing to ensure you\u2019re not a fluke.\n\nAgain, your generosity continues to be aimed towards yourself. You write what you want to write, and what you are passionate about. You publish one after the other, earning meager amounts, but at least it\u2019s something. There is a tick in the back of your brain, like the annoying crocodile from Peter Pan:\n\n\u201cWhat if that was it? What if that was luck?\u201d\n\nImmediately you toss out your passion projects, convinced that nobody is going to go for them, as you analyze statistics, and what genre makes your voice strongest. Forget what you\u2019re feeling passionate about, the things you are passionate about right now are making a name for yourself, not to mention money. The demographics become more and more confusing as you try and think of what is trending and relatable \u2014 your personal take on current events. Be snarky. Be truthful. Be funny. Be funnier. You pander to what you believe the masses want, with no success, barely having enough to take care of your Disney + addiction \u2014 ahem, subscription.\n\nWithout knowing it, you\u2019ve turned yourself into an Idea devoid hack. You don\u2019t know what to write. When you do write, barely anyone gives a crap. You don\u2019t even give a crap. The subject matter no longer matters \u2014 just the voracious drive of sustainability. The need for recognition and recompense chokes out creativity.\n\nIf any of the above relates to you, I\u2019m going to give you a word of advice that is going to make every little ambitious bone in your body scream in terror.\n\nTake a break.\n\n\u201cBut if I take a break, how will I earn \u2014 \u201d\n\nStop right there. You\u2019re missing the point. Almost anybody who writes doesn\u2019t write with the intention of becoming the next Nora Roberts or J. K. Rowling. They write for enjoyment. They write for release. And then they realize they\u2019re good at it and that it might help somebody else too. If you get caught up in the publishing aspect of it, oftentimes you will lose the very thing that made you publishable in the first place. Be true to your writing and be patient. Good prompts come to those who wait.",

        "title": "The 3 Most Important Things I Know About Consumers I Learned From Bartending",
        "text": "My day job is in digital marketing. By night, I bartend.\n\nAnd it\u2019s kind of remarkable how consistent the two are \u2014 mostly because:\n\nPeople are people.\n\n1. It\u2019s never really about the product\n\nPeople don\u2019t drink because they need alcohol. People drink to socialize, to kill time, to have fun, to fit in, to numb their existential crisis. They drink to feel something \u2014 or stop feeling something. (This is true even for people who make alcohol for a living \u2014 some of my area\u2019s local brewery and distillery owners sometimes pop into the bar on their nights off, and even they drink simply to take a load off, not for the drink itself. Everyone does.)\n\nConversely, my previous business was in women\u2019s clothing. Not a single one of my customers actually and truly needed another dress. They were all solving for some other problem \u2014 to feel important, to feel beautiful, to feel special, to feel more comfortable or confident in her skin, to feel younger or more sophisticated or whatever else. This was the case even when I worked with other women in the industry, who lived and breathed clothing \u2014 as products \u2014 every day. When it came time to dress themselves, they were the same as all of us. It\u2019s never about the clothes \u2014 the clothes are simply a means to an ends, and solving for other, bigger problems.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with any product. Unless you are selling electricity or heat or the absolute most basic of food and clothing to someone in dire straits, you are never, ever selling a product. And the need is never what it seems.\n\nUnderstanding these needs goes a long way. You almost never want to speak or market directly in terms of these needs, because it freaks people out and breaks the \u201cmagic\u201d of what they\u2019re doing, but understanding the deeper motivations goes a long way in building rapport.\n\n2. People want to be guided\n\nPeople don\u2019t want to do the heavy lifting of decision-making. Very rarely do customers come to the table knowing exactly what they want \u2014 and if they do, it\u2019s either because (a) they\u2019ve built experience in the subject matter or, more likely, (b) already received input from some other source ahead of time (i.e., \u201cmy friend told me\u2026\u201d or \u201cI heard\u2026\u201d)\n\nOutside of this, most people want guidance.\n\na. People want to know your expertise\n\n\u201cWhat do you recommend?\u201d\n\nThis is by far the number one question I get asked \u2014 as both a bartender and in my day job in digital marketing.\n\nPeople know that this is your domain. They know you see countless exchanges just like this one every single day. They trust your expertise. And, most importantly, they trust this more than they want to entrust themselves with the responsibility of deciding.\n\nTo be honest, this question can be a bit frustrating at the bar, mostly because it\u2019s usually asked cold\u2014i.e., the first thing the customer says to you, with no further context. So I always counter, \u201cwhat do you like?\u201d Because we gotta start somewhere, people \u2014 a whiskey and a pina colada are very different drinks, and I would never recommend one to the other\u2019s crowd.\n\nAt the day job, it\u2019s easier \u2014 because (a) you almost always have some context \u2014 you at least know what their business does before they ask this \u2014 and (b) when it comes down to it, there are infinitely fewer options. The power is really in the execution.\n\nBut either way, people are always looking for your recommendation.\n\nb. People want to know what everyone else is doing\n\n\u201cWhat do others do?\u201d\n\nAgain, one of the most common questions I hear at both the bar and at my day job. I\u2019d estimate the most popular drink at the bar accounts for 30\u201350% of the cocktails we pour. And almost everyone who orders it does so because they heard it was the most popular.\n\nThe funny thing about this is that it\u2019s circular and self-fulfilling. The \u201cmost popular\u201d has a good chance of staying the most popular, because the minute people hear this, they want to have it, too.\n\nOf course, for those paying attention at home: this also means you can \u201ccreate\u201d a \u201cmost popular\u201d item simply by telling people that it\u2019s the most popular. This is sometimes the truth behind \u201cfeatured products\u201d lists.\n\nSocial proof is a powerful thing. And with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n3. Consistency vs. Novelty\n\nConsistency\n\nOn the one hand, people love consistency. They want to believe that they are consistent \u2014 and will often continue historical behavior in order to demonstrate this \u2014 and they want consistency in their environments. They want to understand what they\u2019re getting into.\n\nYou can pretty much always tell when it\u2019s someone\u2019s first time in the bar, because they\u2019ve always got a look on their face like they\u2019ve never been out in public before and they smell dog poop. They don\u2019t hear the bartenders\u2019 greeting. They don\u2019t know where to sit. They look at the menu like they can\u2019t read and they glaze over looking at the wall of booze and beer. They\u2019re lost, they\u2019re disoriented, and they need foothold.\n\nThis is probably how people feel when they first interact with a brand online \u2014 each time acting as though they\u2019ve never used the internet before. And a look on their face like it smells like dog poop.\n\nCustomers want rapport with you. And themselves.\n\nRegulars are confident; secure; happy. They walk in and they know where they want to sit. They know where the bathroom is. They know your name. And most importantly, they know what they want to order \u2014 even if it\u2019s different than last time. Because their drink is an extension of their personality, mood, or needs, and it\u2019s important to them that the two are consistent; that one serves and satisfies the other. And that you\u2019ll get them there.\n\nNovelty\n\nIf you put something in front of people, they will engage with it.\n\nI was recently working from a (different) bar while on a business trip (for the day job), having a beer and minding my own. It was mid-afternoon, so the place was pretty empty. But it was a knock-off of one of those big-box restaurants, this one \u201cCaribbean\u201d themed, so the bartender was making mixed drinks.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of mixed drinks. And I\u2019m definitely not a fan of free sample (srsly \u2014 don\u2019t make it weird.) But I\u2019ll be damned if when she set a few ounces of the extra from her most recent concoction down in front of me, I didn\u2019t down that white, syrup mystery like I\u2019d ordered it.\n\nPeople love new shit.\n\nI definitely get this question \u2014 \u201cwhat\u2019s new?\u201d \u2014 a lot more in my day job. Clients always want to know what new functionality we offer that we didn\u2019t last time we all met \u2014 and, more specifically:\n\n\u201cCan you give me a taste of what others\u2019 are ordering?\u201d \u201cWhat else you guys making?\u201d \u201cWhat am I missing out on?\u201d\n\nAnd it trickles right down to their customers, who have come to expect that each time they hit your site, there will be something new. That\u2019s consistent and the same.\n\nPeople love new. They love novelty.\n\nFree Shit, Full Prices, Rapport and Reciprocation\n\nNow\u2019s as good a time as any to include a note about \u201cfree shit.\u201d\n\nPeople love free shit. They love beer samples. They love giveaways. They love discounts.\n\nWhen companies \u2014 and bartenders \u2014 give little shit away, it gets people engaged, and it inspires them to come back and spend, through the power of reciprocity. They feel like you guys really had something special.\n\nThe caveat, however, is that it has to seem targeted, special, and unexpected. If customers know that you\u2019re giving everyone a sample of beer \u2014 or 10% off \u2014 the magic is broken. They\u2019re definitely still going to reciprocate \u2014 but it\u2019s going to be in like-kind. They\u2019re going to treat you as a source for discounts. If you want this, awesome \u2014 seems like it\u2019s working fine for Costco. But if you don\u2019t want this, tread lightly. Build the relationship instead \u2014 or alongside.\n\nThere\u2019s a little local deli two blocks away from our office, and a group of us go there for lunch almost every day. They make good sandwiches, the prices are good, and the employees always remember us \u2014 and our orders.\n\nI had heard that they had \u201cget a free sandwich on us!\u201d cards floating around \u2014 at least one of my colleagues had received one \u2014 but they don\u2019t hand them out like candy. They don\u2019t shove them in your face as you walk by on the sidewalk; they aren\u2019t laying around on the counter. They are given person to person, probably with first names used, and unexpectedly. And when I finally got one, on probably my 100th visit, it was simply icing on the cake \u2014 an almost superfluous acknowledgement \u2014 and not something I was grabby for.\n\nPeople want to like you\n\nAnd they want you to like them. And perhaps most importantly, they want others to like them. And they want to like themselves.\n\nThe closer you help them get to all of these goals, the closer you are to your goals as well.",

        "title": "Questions I Get as a Self-Published Writer",
        "text": "Questions I Get as a Self-Published Writer\n\nAnd encouragement for anyone starting or thinking about their publishing journey\n\nPhoto by Da Kraplak on Unsplash\n\nI\u2019ve officially been a full time writer for three months, and holy cow it\u2019s been an amazing adventure so far. In that time, I\u2019ve started, finished, and published six titles, set two more for pre-order, and finished two additional books. The material varies between short stories, nonfiction, novels, and series, but the end result is that I get another checkmark in my goal for 20 self-published books.\n\nIn that time, I\u2019ve built my writing community, reading community, and even extended my reach beyond to old friends and connections. I\u2019ve had more people reach out to me in the last three months to check in than before. It\u2019s been a great ride.\n\nI think the fun part is getting all the questions from people who have no clue what the writing or publishing process is like. Their genuine interest in it reminded me that these are some of the questions I had about the process when I was just starting out as a writer and learning the ropes. So, I gathered some of the best questions and answers to help not only those who are new to the process but encourage anyone who might be starting their publishing journey.\n\nWhat\u2019s your book about?\n\nWhich one?\n\nI could go on for hours and hours if there wasn\u2019t a time limit to our conversation. Talking about writing is potentially my number two favorite thing about writing, after, of course, writing. With a series under my belt already, I can usually give a quick synopsis of that before diving into my new series.\n\nThe great part about this question is that it forced me to actually create an elevator pitch for my book. I never queried to publishers or tried to get someone to buy my idea so I didn\u2019t exactly have this sorted out. But this is potentially the most common question an author gets so it\u2019s important to work on it. I cover genre, a rundown of theme, and then get super giddy if they ask more pointed questions about the idea.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you want to get a publisher?\n\nHonestly, at one point I thought about it. My standalone book hits hard enough topics and sends a tough message to where I thought I should consider querying. But after careful consideration, I decided that I loved the freedom and ability to run my writing like a business. It fits my personality, authorpreneurship spirit, and, quite frankly, I love just writing and sending my work into the world on my own time.\n\nBut you\u2019re not a \u201creal\u201d writer\u2026\n\nWTF? I write, and that makes me a writer. I publish, which makes me a published writer. I write books, which makes me a novel writer. Just because I don\u2019t go the \u201ctraditional\u201d route doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m no less of a writer. I\u2019m also not better, but I love that I can be in control of my work. I\u2019m stubborn so I prefer being in control of every portion of the writing and publishing process. I rely on myself alone for success, which is just how I like it.\n\nSo, you just write?\n\nI mean, I write, yes. But I also run my publishing like a business. I market, I advertise, I write, I read, I write again, I design covers, and I do a million other things. I run every part of the business, and I do it constantly. I\u2019m always looking for the resources to grow my business, get traction and eyes on my books, and make money.\n\nHow do you do all of that during the day?\n\nAn insane amount of planning, focus, and caffeine. I\u2019ve transitioned to a Passion Planner (affl) to keep my schedule in order. I can track my word count, time block and make sure I\u2019m staying focused but also giving myself breaks, and monitor my publication dates. I can run my social media schedule, know when a book needs to be written to hit a deadline, and celebrate wins with treats and look back on my productivity.\n\nI\u2019m able to keep track of all my projects using this system. I know when I\u2019m publishing nonfiction too, so I make sure I have three or more articles prepared on Sunday for the week ahead. I know when I work best on each of my tasks so I can stay on task. Nonfiction can be written when there are more potential distractions so I keep those ideas for my weekend writing when my husband is busy around the house. Fiction is best written in the morning when the dog has settled down and my husband has left for work. Every weekday, I know I\u2019m working on fiction at 9AM sharp.\n\nBut in reality, you just sleep most of the day, scroll social media, and watch TV, right?\n\nNo. Some days I take a break. Some days when I can\u2019t seem to produce words, I focus on administrative tasks. Other days I\u2019m writing well into my lunch break and even after my husband gets home from work. Some days require more work on marketing and design while others can be spent writing. There\u2019s variation, but I\u2019m stubborn, hard working, and run my writing like a business that I refuse to see fail. Because I refuse to fail. I will keep at it until my fingers bleed because this is my passion and I\u2019m in love with it.\n\nDon\u2019t you get burned out?\n\nThere\u2019s always a danger of burning out, especially because I am treating it like a business and I\u2019m the only employee. I make sure to take healthy breaks, get exercise, drink tons of water, and focus on other things when I just can\u2019t get the words to work. There\u2019s a balance and it varies between every writer. I\u2019m lucky enough to get work done during the week and take the weekends \u201coff\u201d. I minimize the amount of absolute requirements that must be done on the weekends, instead delegating lesser tasks like cover design, scheduling social media, and reading to my weekend hours.\n\nHow can you keep producing work? How do you have so many ideas?\n\nCreativity and ideas favor the consistent. Every day, I do something related to my writing business (on vacations, I suffer and only think about writing). The more you stick with a habit, build a routine, and work on it every day, the easier it is to find ideas in everything. I have two more series ideas working in the back of my mind, growing and developing as I consider how things could play out. When I finish this current series, I\u2019ll know which one is developed enough to pick up and make my next project. For nonfiction, I keep a growing list of headline ideas I can pull from when it\u2019s time to write an article. I\u2019m always prepared for what\u2019s next, even when I\u2019m in the middle of a big project.\n\nHow many words do you write each day?\n\nDepends. Sometimes I get 2K really awesome words. Some days I can get over 10K (more rare now that we have a puppy). Other days I\u2019m scraping for 300. Some days I need to focus more on administrative things and can only get a few hundred. Other days I need to focus on editing and can even negate my word counts. I understand that a 150 word day doesn\u2019t necessarily mean failure (unless I totally wasted my time doing something else, which is rare).\n\nI wish I could write a book\u2026\n\nGreat! How can I help you? What questions do you have? Do you have an idea? Do you currently write daily? What about write, period? Where are you willing to sacrifice some time to get 100 words in during the day? What are you willing to cut from your schedule so you can sit in front of the keyboard? Are you willing to work for a long time on it to get that first draft done? What about the extra few months after the book is finished to edit and polish and prepare?\n\nThis is usually when people stammer, and not just because I\u2019m intense. Everyone loves the idea of \u201chaving written a book\u201d but realize that there\u2019s actually a lot of hard work to \u201cwrite the book\u201d. There are people who want to have a book but don\u2019t want to actually do the work and there are people who are willing to power through the hard parts to get to the finish line.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. Not everyone is going to write a book. The idea is nice, but those writers who are actually invested in the process are the ones who will actually put in the work. It\u2019s like wanting to get a marathon medal without actually running the race \u2014 the people who train and actually run are the ones who will cross the finish line.",

        "title": "AI Essentials: Working with Matrices",
        "text": "Matrix Multiplication\n\nMatrix multiplication follows a slightly more verbose methodology than simple addition or subtraction. When multiplying matrices, each row of the previous matrix multiplies with each column of the next matrix. This will become clearer in the example to follow.\n\nOne way to think of this process is that each row of the first matrix processes each column of the second matrix. Let\u2019s firstly present two 2 x 2 matrices to multiply:\n\nTo calculate the final matrix (that is currently empty) each row of the first matrix needs to multiply with every column of the second matrix. The resulting matrix is known as the dot product of the matrices being multiplied.\n\nDot products are widely used in machine learning, with NumPy supplying their own dot function to leverage.\n\nThis process is admittedly is extremely hard to visualise, so let\u2019s break it down into stages. The first row and column process resembles the following:\n\nNotice that we\u2019re starting with the first row of matrix 1, and the first column of matrix 2. The corresponding values are multiplied, with their products added together resulting in one dot product value.\n\nSince there are more columns to multiply, row 1 then multiples with the next column of matrix 2:\n\nNow row 1 of matrix 1 has processed all columns of matrix 2, we can repeat the whole process for row 2:\n\nAnd finally process the last column of matrix 2 with the currently active row of matrix 1:\n\nAnd this concludes the dot product process. We can now simplify the resulting matrix with its true values:\n\nThis concludes the dot product process! However, there are some requirements in order for a multiplication to be valid. The above example multiplies two matrices of shape 2 x 2 for simplicity, but there are a couple of rules that one must be aware of when dealing with matrix multiplication that pertains to the shapes and ordering of the matrices being multiplied. Let\u2019s briefly take a look at these requirements.\n\nThe requirements of matrix multiplication\n\nEven though the size of the matrices being multiplied does not need to be the same, the inner numbers must match. This requirement is obviously always met in the case of square matrices, but when the dimensions are different, then the column count of matrix 1 must match the row count of matrix 2.\n\nThe shape of the resulting matrix is also determined by the shapes of the multiplying matrices\u2014 their outer numbers to be exact. These two rules are summarised in the following multiplication:\n\nOuter values determine the resulting shape, and the inner values must be the same for the multiplication to be valid, or defined. If the inner values are not the same, the resulting matrix will be undefined.\n\nBecause of these requirements, it is not possible to multiply a non-square matrix with itself! The result would be undefined. This would entail multiplying, for example, a 2 x 3 matrix with a 2 x 3 matrix, and the inner numbers here do not match. We could however do an element-wise multiplication, that will be mentioned further down.\n\nWith multiplication, ordering also matters\n\nUnlike scaler products, the resulting matrix will differ depending on which way round the matrices are in your formula. In other words, matrix multiplication is not commutative.\n\nIf we take the product of two regular numbers, it does not matter which way round they are multiplied. E.g:\n\n6 x 4 = 24 A x B\n\n4 x 6 = 24 B x A\n\n== Same result\n\nThis is not the case with matrices. Re-ordering even the simplest of matrices yields a drastically different dot product:\n\nDot product vs element-wise multiplication\n\nAnother type of matrix multiplication is known as element-wise multiplication. This is where each index of matrix A is multiplied with matrix B. For this type of multiplication to be valid, both matrices must be the same shape.\n\nElement-wise operations are useful for adjusting a matrix in some way, such as normalising the elements with element-wise multiplication, or adjusting magnitude by increasing or decreasing all the elements uniformly.\n\nDid you notice? \u2014 matrix addition and subtraction are also element-wise operations.\n\nWorking with scalers\n\nMatrices can also be manipulated using plain scaler numbers, with all the operations previously mentioned. This is a nice shortcut for manipulating every matrix element in the same way without having to define another matrix to achieve the same result \u2014 and works great in code. NumPy supports such operations out of the box:\n\n\"\"\" Scaler operations on matrices \"\"\" import numpy as np arr1 = np.array([[2, -3], [5, 9], [-4, -0]]) # adds 5 to each matrix element\n\nprint(arr1 + 5)\n\n>>> [[ 7 2]\n\n[10 14]\n\n[ 1 5]] # subtracts 20 from each matrix element\n\nprint(arr1 - 20)\n\n>>> [[-18 -23]\n\n[-15 -11]\n\n[-24 -20]] # multiplies each matrix element by 5\n\nprint(5 * arr1)\n\n>>> [[ 10 -15]\n\n[25 45]\n\n[-20 0]]\n\nLet\u2019s explore some key interesting properties with matrix multiplication next.\n\nWhat about division? There is no such thing as division when working with matrices. You can add, subtract, and multiply matrices, but you cannot divide them. There are concepts that loosely resemble division such as inverse matrices \u2014 this will be covered further down.",

        "title": "Making AI Better by Making it Slower",
        "text": "The difference between beneficial and destructive AI may be whether making fast thinking faster has any utility for the user.\n\nA couple of months ago I left my job at Auth0 to join a defense and national security company founded by some friends of mine. It was a risky decision both because the company is new and because when one is working with the military, one is inevitably building technology that will either directly or indirectly kill people. It is an environment rich with ethical dilemmas and most technologists prefer to keep their hands clean by simply opting out of any involvement at all.\n\nThere were lots of reasons why decided to take the risk, but the most relevant one to this blog post is that everyone in the tech community lately is talking about building \u201cethical\u201d products and no one can really define how a software development process that produced ethical products is different from a process that produced normal products. Just \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d may no longer be Google\u2019s motto, but it is definitely still how Silicon Valley thinks about things.\n\nI\u2019m not the kind of person that believes that outcomes are determined by the quality of the people. The best engineers sometimes build shitty technology together. Teams are not a sum of their parts. Simply assembling a collection of thoughtful people (and Rebellion has employed A LOT of lifelong pacifists) does not mean they will build ethical technology.\n\nBut team are a sum of their interactions and interactions are government by formal and informal process. I am the type of person who likes designing effective process and I had by the time I finally accepted my friend\u2019s offer come to believe that AI in defense is a when situation not an if situation. The opportunity for an outright ban has come and gone, these tools will enter the battle space and the impact of that will largely be determined by who participates in bringing them there.\n\nEscalation -vs- De-escalation\n\nEvery month at work we have a standing organization wide meeting to discuss our ethics. In one early version of this meeting we decided that the distinction between offensive tools and defensive tools was not a useful one for exploring the impact of what we might build. The difference between defensive and offensive is really who\u2019s holding the tool and what they are pointing it at. That\u2019s not something easy to design software around.\n\nInstead we ended up focusing on the idea of escalating and de-escalating conflict. Responsible technology in the defense space is technology that helps people think deeper and more critically about the choices in front of them. Irresponsible technology encourages them to jump to conclusions or leaves them so far removed from the on the ground reality it dehumanizes the people who are negatively effected when the technology is deployed.\n\nBut how does one design AI that de-escalates?\n\nHuman in the Loop\n\nEthical AI people love to talk about \u201cKeeping the human in the loop.\u201d In an earlier blog post I discussed this concept using the framework of System Safety, an existing scientific field that studies the counter-intuitive ways safety policies either benefit or sabotage safety outcomes.\n\nHuman in the loop is an effective guiding principle when designing policy, but it is a little more difficult when designing technology because ALL technology redistributes how human labor is applied in a given process. When new technology is introduced to an existing task, some steps are automated away and other new steps become necessary. How does the product team determine when moving the human\u2019s position in the process is taking them out of the loop or not?\n\nType 1 -vs- Type 2 Thinking\n\nThe answer may come from how human and computer thought combine and play off one another. One model of how human\u2019s think popularized by the book Thinking Fast and Slow is called Type 1 -vs- Type 2. Type 1 is intuitive (fast) thinking. It\u2019s low effort for humans. Instinctual, based mainly on pattern matching and how close a given piece of knowledge resembles another piece of historic knowledge. Type 2 is analytical (slow) thinking. Calculating, often statistical in nature. It\u2019s high effort for humans and therefore needs to be budgeted appropriately, but often corrects mistakes made by Type 1 thinking.\n\nFunny enough, the early days of AI research documented something called Moravec\u2019s Paradox which observes that computers have the complete opposite relationship to Type 1 and Type 2 thinking. For a computer Type 2 thinking is easy, Type 1 thinking is hard and resource intensive. Nearly all of machine learning and AI is Type 1 thinking. AI products therefore tend to focus on accelerating Type 1 thinking for human operators.\n\nBut Type 1 thinking is already fast, and I\u2019m beginning to suspect the line between beneficial AI products and the ones that create problems is asking how much utility the user really gets out of making fast thinking faster? Web developers understand the law of diminishing returns almost as well as economists. It\u2019s what governs the development of Service Level Objectives. There is a point where simply making a website faster doesn\u2019t really improve the user\u2019s experience any, it just spends money.\n\nSimilarly there is a point where making Type 1 thinking faster doesn\u2019t actually offer the user any added benefit, but it does dramatically increase the odds of a critical error.\n\nIf humans struggle with Type 2 and excel at Type 1 thinking, and computers struggle with Type 1 thinking and excel at Type 2, and good decision making involves using Type 2 thinking to error check Type 1 thinking\u2026.why are we building machines to do Type 1 thinking for us? Isn\u2019t there much more utility from using computers to make slow thinking more resource efficient rather than making fast thinking faster?\n\nProblem Selection\n\nThe more I explore the question of AI and ethics, the more I understand how critical problem selection is. The exact same technology can have dramatically different ramifications depending on how the problem it is solving is framed.\n\nConsider two scenarios:\n\nA police officer is trying to identify people in a photograph. AI isolates their faces and looks for matches in a facial recognition database.\n\nA police officer has seized a hard drive with thousands of files on it. AI searches the files and prioritizes them based on faces of significance that might be present in them.\n\nIn the first scenario the computer attempts to do the Type 1 thinking for the human operator. Although some operators will examine the match carefully and critically to confirm the AI\u2019s results, most will not. Most will do no thinking at all and simply assume that a match is a definite match.\n\nThe second scenario unblocks the human from doing the Type 1 thinking. In real life, the backlog of digital forensic evidence to be processed is often years long. So long that much forensic evidence never gets looked at at all, the case just moves on without it. For all the power of modern computers this work still involves a lot of manual searching by a human operator. Using AI to increase the efficiency of the process, increases the critical thinking being done by the human in the loop, rather than replacing it. Even if some important files are missed you still get more than you would have without it.\n\nHere\u2019s a non-hypothetical example: compare the notorious sentencing recommendation application COMPAS to a similar system called ESAS. On the surface, both technologies seem to solve the same problem: making recommendations on sentencing based on historical data. COMPAS attempts to distill lots of data down to simple conclusions that the user can disregard, but cannot dig into or challenge. It considers everything from your parent\u2019s criminal history, to the lifestyles of your friends, to your answers to personality questions. ESAS, on the other hand, focuses on just the case information. It looks for similar cases and lets the user easily find and explore the context around the sentences that resulted. What made one case worth a long prison sentence and another case with the same charge a shorter one?\n\nCOMPAS attempts to do the Type 1 thinking for the user and because both the algorithms and data used to create the recommendation are hidden, the Type 2 thinking that would check for Type 1 errors is blocked. Worse, COMPAS assigns a numerical value to their recommendations. Someone wasn\u2019t just \u201chigh risk\u201d they were high risk on a numerical scale. One of the things we know about Type 1 thinking is that it is susceptible to anchoring. Give someone a high number, and even if they think that high number is wrong, the number they replace it with will be higher than they otherwise would have estimated.\n\nMuch has been made of the biases in the data that backs COMPAS, but in truth even if the data had been perfect COMPAS would still have created bad outcomes. It automates error prone Type 1 thinking, poisons the user\u2019s judgment with an arbitrary anchoring value and prevents Type 2 thinking from spotting problems.\n\nBuried in COMPAS\u2019s definition of the problem is also one monster of an unchallenged assumption: that a person at high risk of reoffending will be made less likely to reoffend by giving them a longer prison sentence. That the cause of reoffending is some character flaw that the prison system corrects. COMPAS does not consider that the relationship might actually be reversed: that people who spend more time in prison become disconnected from social support networks and are more likely to reoffend in order to survive.\n\nThis is the danger of replacing Type 1 thinking done by humans with Type 1 thinking done by computers. Computers can calculate a correlation, but they cannot construct a narrative around it that turns that correlation into actionable insight. Therefore even the best algorithms need human beings to consider the context of their results. AI that removes that context lives or dies by the accuracy of its model. AI that removes that context over several layers of abstraction carves a large blast radius into the Earth when it goes wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, AI that increases the speed and opportunities in which human beings can apply both Type 1 and Type 2 thinking fairs much better. Early trials with ESAS in Florida have shown that by matching a case to a range of comparable cases and allowing users to explore their context overall length of sentences were reduced, sometimes considerably. The ESAS team estimated that just five criminal cases saved the state of Florida $1 million in the daily costs of incarceration.\n\nDesigning AI by Redistribution\n\nThe narrative with advancements in technology is usually about what gets replaced, but technology doesn\u2019t actually replace, it redistributes. The time, energy and money spent on one part of the process shifts to another part of the same process. Adding a computer to something might remove a human being performing a manual process, but replaces it with multiple human beings who build, deploy and maintain the computer doing the work.\n\nThe impact and ultimate effectiveness of any product that uses AI, therefore, is determined not by which algorithms it uses, but how it redistributes human effort. Is it creating more opportunities for critical thinking or encouraging more action with less thought and discussion? Software engineers who build AI need to pay attention to computer human interaction more so than other programmers. AI that does Type 1 thinking for the user and blocks Type 2 thinking typically leads to disastrous outcomes. AI that increases the opportunities for Type 1 thinking and encourages the user to add the Type 2 error checking to the machine\u2019s Type 1 thinking, tends to increase utility.",

        "title": "A Call for Great Stories: We\u2019re Reimagining The Startup, Medium\u2019s Largest Publication with +680K Followers",
        "text": "I\u2019m excited to take on the role of Editor in Chief of The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest publication (680K+ followers). Our tagline, \u201cBuild Something Awesome,\u201d gets to the heart of our mission: to help readers get smarter at building their things; and to offer writers a platform to share their stories \u2014 of work, inspiration, and creativity.\n\nThis year in Paris, after the mandatory quarantine was lifted, one of the first things I did was visit the Centre Pompidou, Paris\u2019s modern art museum. The featured exhibition was a tribute to late artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whom I first discovered through their installation, The Gates, in New York City\u2019s Central Park. I was a college student at the time and rode the subway downtown to experience what seemed like a unique moment in history. I remember feeling mesmerized as I watched the gates\u2019 saffron fabric swaying gently in the midtown breeze.\n\nIn Paris, the exhibition focused on the artists\u2019 Pont Neuf project \u2014 when in 1985, Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped Paris\u2019 oldest bridge, Pont Neuf, in shimmering, celestial gold fabric. The result was breathtaking.\n\nLesser known, and what the exhibition revealed, was the years of meticulous planning and persistent convincing it took to realize it \u2014 nearly a decade\u2019s worth.\n\nI left the Pompidou inspired, both by the beauty of the artists\u2019 work and the underlying takeaway:\n\nGreat things take time \u2014 and a lot of planning.\n\nSpeaking of which, as we approach the seven-year mark since our launch, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of planning for the future of The Startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve decided to reimagine our publication. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe other day, I told a close friend about my new role at The Startup. After offering her congratulations, she asked, point-blank: Caitlin, what is The Startup?\n\nTo me, The Startup should be a digital visit to a space for education and inspiration. As editor, I want to curate original and valuable insights from our contributors. I want readers to walk away inspired \u2014 and equipped with the tools to realize their own Pont Neuf.\n\nBut more recently, we\u2019ve come up against some challenges.\n\nThe Startup has grown \u2014 fast. Having nearly 700k followers and a quarter of a million daily readers doesn\u2019t just equal extensive readership. It also means that we get an incredibly high volume of submissions from Medium authors \u2014 according to Medium\u2019s internal data team, the highest of any publication on their platform.\n\nThe beauty of working with an innovative platform like Medium is that traditional publishing barriers are removed. Anyone (with a Medium account) can submit a story for consideration.\n\nBut with that waived entry fee comes the challenge of sifting through all of those stories, and somewhere along the way, our mission got diluted.\n\nAs EIC, I want to reaffirm our raison d\u2019\u00eatre. I want to reestablish our standards and in doing so, give authors better, clearer guidance to boost their chances of being published on The Startup. And, I want to cultivate a diversity of voices.\n\nAnd authors: Once you submit, we promise, we read and carefully consider every single story. With the Medium interface, we see your headline before we see your name. Our publication decisions are based on merit, not your existing portfolio. The benefit of this, and the excitement for us editors, is that we have the opportunity to offer a platform to new and emerging writers.\n\nAnd trust me: great writing shines instantly.\n\nSo let\u2019s start with our revamped editorial strategy.\n\nTo pull back the curtain on our editorial strategy, I think it\u2019s necessary to consider four questions.\n\n1. Who are we?\n\nIn short: The Startup isn\u2019t just for tech entrepreneurs.\n\nOur readers and contributors include founders, creatives, designers, developers, marketers, freelancers, and writers.\n\nSome are 9\u20135 office professionals launching a side hustle; others have already founded a startup (or several); still, others are just at that nascent, daydreaming stage, taking the first step toward planning to build their thing.\n\nRegardless of where they are on their entrepreneurial path, The Startup should be a resource \u2014 because it\u2019s never been easier to start a company, but it\u2019s also never been harder to build something successfully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been easier to start a company. It\u2019s never been harder to build one.\u201d \u2014 Naval Ravikant\n\nWhether they\u2019re thinking of building an internet empire, launching an AI startup, or looking for sustainable productivity advice, our stories empower readers with insightful perspectives.\n\n2. What do we cover?\n\nBig picture, our content falls into two categories.\n\nFirst, the \u201cevergreen\u201d topics. These include:\n\nMaker life: Entrepreneurship, creativity, freelancing, startups, investing, innovation, marketing, social media\n\nCulture today: leadership, diversity, inclusivity, climate change and sustainability.\n\nTechnology: Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, VR/AR/MR, IoT, robotics, data science, machine learning and big data.\n\nWeb dev and design: UX, UI, design, developing, programming, apps, software, hardware and SaaS.\n\nSecond, stories relating to a monthly theme, which will be shared in our \u201ccall for stories\u201d published at the outset of each month.\n\nThis month, we\u2019re interested in: the psychology of building your own thing. How does the entrepreneurial journey affect our state of mind? How does it impact our relationship with others? Is there new thinking on entrepreneurial guilt from taking time off? How does the \u201calways-on\u201d mindset affect our quality of life? Is your startup bleeding into your family time? (Note: please don\u2019t send us a story that reads like a diary entry.) These are just a few examples of potential topics to explore. Most importantly, we want fresh, eye-opening insights. Send us stories that explore your experience with the psychology of building your own thing.\n\n3. How can I be published?\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how to increase your chances of becoming one of our writers, here, some tips for making your story shine when submitting to The Startup.\n\nDo the research \u2014 Not infrequently, we receive stories that include assertion after assertion with zero authoritative sources or research. Unless you\u2019re Elon Musk, you\u2019ll need something to hang your hat on. On second thought, we\u2019d probably ask Musk for links to sources, too. Because even the best writers back their facts up with references \u2014 be it published research or expert opinion. Include links to sources that support the factual assertions in your writing. Don\u2019t skimp on the intro \u2014 You know what they say: first impressions are everything. We receive a lot of submissions that begin with a couple of lines and quickly cut to: X tips for doing Y better. Instead of rushing, get creative with your introduction. Drop us into the action; paint a vivid picture of a real-life example; come up with an attention-grabbing way to introduce us to your story, be it a shocking research finding or a little-known statistic. Master the headline \u2014 We can help you tweak this part, but the stories that immediately grab our attention already have strong headlines and subheads. Consider the stories that draw you in \u2014 do their headlines sound like clickbait-y advertisements? (The Secret to This Productivity Hack Will Shock You!) Or, are they thoughtful, high-quality propositions that leave you deeply curious for more. (Productivity Is About Prioritizing, Not About Time Management). I\u2019m guessing the latter. Don\u2019t transplant ideas \u2014 Again, we allow and even encourage you to rely on other publications to support your facts. But we do not accept the transplanting of another writer\u2019s ideas entirely. (Also, it violates Medium\u2019s rules against plagiarism.) Simply rewording doesn\u2019t cut the mustard, either. Read our publication \u2014 Your birth story might be very interesting (I\u2019m a new mom! I love birth stories!) but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good fit for our publication. I can\u2019t tell you how many submissions we get on topics that are completely unrelated to our publication. That, or a topic that\u2019s already been covered (e.g., chances are, the story behind [insert big-name startup] has already been told). Take some time to browse our publication before sending us your story. Ask yourself: why? Why should the reader spend the time it takes (typically 5\u201310 minutes) to read your story? Will it add value to their lives? Will it entertain them? Could it change their way of thinking? It\u2019s good practice to consider the \u201cwhy\u201d before you sit down to write anything.\n\n4. How will The Startup support me, the writer?\n\nDuring the editing process, we\u2019ll work with authors to make their stories even better. We\u2019ll also regularly share guides and tips for getting published. Consider this the first of an ongoing series of stories from The Startup, aimed at improving our communication and providing you the tools to get your great stories heard.\n\nAs an official Medium partner, The Startup will work to achieve an even higher rate of curation for our authors and distribute their stories to an even wider audience.",

        "title": "A Simple Framework for Capturing and Organizing Your Blog Post Ideas",
        "text": "Several times a week, I run writing workshops. This morning one of my students mentioned that she wished she had some sort of a framework for capturing and organizing her blog post ideas.\n\nAt first I thought she meant just making a list of them, but it turned out what she really wanted a was a framework \u2014 a way of quickly taking down the bones of blog post idea so that she doesn\u2019t lose it, in a way that would make writing it later easier.\n\nOh, I told her, I actually have one of those.\n\nMy students were excited \u2014 to the point of taking me by surprise. And I was super excited, because I\u2019ve always struggled with how to help my students who want to write more blog posts, but just aren\u2019t.\n\nI realized all of a sudden that I was missing what the real problem was.\n\nThey needed a way to wrap their heads around what they want to write so that they can A) keep track of their ideas as they get them and B) write them quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe PSST Framework\n\nThe PSST Framework is something I just do it without really thinking too much about it. A mentor told me once that\u2019s the kind of thing that needs to be taught the most. As soon as you think something\u2019s too basic to teach, you know you\u2019re on to something that\u2019s right in your wheelhouse.\n\nBecause if it feels easy to you, then you\u2019ve got a good enough handle on it to teach it to someone else. And trust me, there is always someone else who wants to know how to do what\u2019s easy for you because it isn\u2019t easy for them.\n\nSo, I impromptu spent an hour teaching my PSST Framework to my students this morning.\n\nThere are four parts. Once you get the hang of it, you can build a PSST Framework around any idea in a few minutes. Today, during our workshop, we organized a blog post for four different writers in an hour, so it took about fifteen minutes each and that included a lot of teaching and workshopping that you wouldn\u2019t have if you were doing this on your own.\n\nEach of my students came away with an idea that was both well-documented and organized so that they\u2019ll be able to easily write it when they\u2019re ready.\n\nI can do this in five or ten minute with even a complicated idea. I don\u2019t think it would take long for anyone to get to where they can do it as quickly.\n\nThe four parts include: Premise, Story, Subheads, Takeaway. (Hence, PSST.)\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at each one.\n\nPremise\n\nThis is just a sentence that states your idea. I think about it as a working title.\n\nYou want your working title, or premise, to be a sentence that you\u2019ll understand when you come back to it even weeks later, when the idea isn\u2019t in the forefront of your mind.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t be clever here. You can rework the title later. This is a great exercise though, because your final title actually should be this clear and concise.\n\nAsk yourself this question: If I read this sentence to a friend, would they know what I was writing about, without any more information?\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a premise that doesn\u2019t really work: What kind of writer are you?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t really mean anything. I would have known just what I meant by it the day I came up with it and forgotten my intent entirely when I came back to it.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised premise for the same post: How to figure out what kind of writing career you want to have and make a plan to make it happen.\n\nAs far as post titles go, it\u2019s too long. But if I read that to someone, they would know what I was talking about without any other information from me. And I\u2019ll remember what I wanted to write, even weeks or months later if it comes to that.\n\nStory\n\nEvery blog post should start with a story. I firmly believe that.\n\nSo, the second part of the PSST Framework involves making a note to yourself about what story you\u2019re going to tell. Your story should be personal and specifically related to your post.\n\nThink about it as an invitation to your reader into your story. It\u2019s their assurance that you\u2019re someone they can trust. And your story hooks them and keeps them reading.\n\nFor the post I mentioned above, my story note was about a Facebook post that came across my feed that asked the question what kind of reader are you? and how that question had stuck with me all day. It\u2019s a small story, but knew the post would run long, so I didn\u2019t want a long, in depth opening.\n\nSubheads\n\nOnce you have your premise and your story, now you can just make a list of your possible subheads. This is a bullet list of points you want to make in your post.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about writing the actual subheads that you\u2019re use in your post. You\u2019ll rewrite them later. For now, just list the points you want to hit.\n\nFor the post I wrote this morning, my subheads included:\n\nWhat kind of writers are there?\n\nHow to use your notebook to figure out what kind of writer you are.\n\nYour past experience.\n\nYour current writing life.\n\nYour future writing plans.\n\nThe gaps.\n\nWhen I come back to a list like that later, I can very easily see exactly what I what I was thinking of when I had this idea. I have an outline for my post that only took me a few minutes to write down.\n\nCan you see how writing this post will be easier than it would be without the Framework? I just have to go from subhead to subhead. But it isn\u2019t written in stone. I might come up with other ideas as I\u2019m writing and that\u2019s okay, too.\n\nThis is a framework, not a steel cage.\n\nTakeaway\n\nEvery blog post ends with a takeaway for the reader. Some reason why you\u2019ve told them the story you\u2019ve just told them or given them the information you\u2019ve just given them.\n\nEven very personal essays end with some kind of take away. What do you want readers to do with what they\u2019ve just learned? What do you want them to think about or know or understand?\n\nSometimes your takeaway is very clear. A specific call to action \u2014 directions or instructions for how to do something very specific. The take away for the post you\u2019re reading now will be to go forth and create a PSST Framework for your own blog post ideas.\n\nSometimes it will be a little more esoteric. If you were writing a personal essay, your takeaway might be more along the lines of a reminder that something you\u2019re talking about is worth doing or learning. Or that your reader isn\u2019t alone in whatever they might be suffering.\n\nThe takeaway for the post I wrote this morning was a list of possible kinds of writers and examples of plans those writers might use to bridge the gap between where they are and where they want to be. The hope being that those examples would help readers understand how to do the same planning for their own specific situations.\n\nPutting the PSST Framework All Together\n\nI have a Google Doc with a simple table where I can record my ideas in the PSST Framework format.\n\nIt looks like this when I\u2019m done.\n\nScreenshot: Author\n\nIf you\u2019d like a copy of the Google Doc that I use, click here.\n\nI also just use my notebook, if I\u2019m out and about and get an idea. Usually, I just make a note of the first part of the framework \u2014 the premise \u2014 and then wait until I\u2019m on my computer to fill out the rest. But if I\u2019m feeling inspired, it\u2019s super easy to remember just the four questions sections of the framework, especially with the acronym.\n\nChallenge yourself to work through the PSST Framework on one new idea every day and see what happens.",

        "text": "Who are Medium\u2019s Curators and What do They do?\n\nMedium\u2019s editorial curation team is tasked with reviewing thousands of stories every day. They have 30\u201350 curators with a diverse set of interests and experiences. Some come from writing and editing backgrounds, while others have specific expertise in fields that are popular on Medium.\n\nThe curators look for quality stories on Medium. When they select a story, they then add it to topics, which makes those stories eligible for personalized distribution and promotion across Medium \u2014 on the homepage, on topic pages, in the app, in the Daily Digest newsletter, and in other emails.\n\nBelow is a job listing that was posted by Medium awhile back, that may offer some insight into the curators role:\n\nIs Having Your Story Distributed by Medium\u2019s Curators Essential to Success on Medium?\n\nYes and no. If you have no following, are writing fiction or poetry, or have no experience with SEO \u2014 it is going to be very hard to receive views and gain traction on Medium.\n\nCurators have a lot of say in selecting \u201cthe best writing.\u201d Curators are the gate keepers of Medium\u2019s coveted homepage, topic pages/top writers, the Daily Digest newsletter, and other emails that millions receive.\n\nBefore I explain how you can succeed without being curated, it\u2019s worth reviewing the list of Medium\u2019s topics. These represent all the categories that your article can be curated in. While many other tags exist, these are the topics that your article must be relevant to.\n\nWhat are the Medium Categories for Possible Curator Selection?\n\nMedium Topics\n\nArts & Entertainment\n\nArt\n\nBeauty\n\nBooks\n\nComics\n\nCulture\n\nFiction\n\nFilm\n\nFood\n\nGaming\n\nHumor\n\nMedium Magazine\n\nMusic\n\nPhotography\n\nPodcasts\n\nPoetry\n\nSocial Media\n\nSports\n\nStyle\n\nTrue Crime\n\nTV\n\nWriting\n\nIndustry\n\nBusiness\n\nDesign\n\nEconomy\n\nFreelancing\n\nLeadership\n\nMarketing\n\nProduct Management\n\nProductivity\n\nStartups\n\nVenture Capital\n\nWork\n\nInnovation & Tech\n\nAccessibility\n\nAndroid Dev\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nBlockchain\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nCybersecurity\n\nData Science\n\nDigital Life\n\nGadgets\n\niOS Dev\n\nJavascript\n\nMachine Learning\n\nMath\n\nNeuroscience\n\nProgramming\n\nScience\n\nSelf-Driving Cars\n\nSoftware Engineering\n\nSpace\n\nTechnology\n\nUX\n\nVisual Design\n\nLife\n\nAddiction\n\nCannabis\n\nCreativity\n\nDisability\n\nFamily\n\nHealth\n\nLifestyle\n\nMental Health\n\nMindfulness\n\nMoney\n\nParenting\n\nPets\n\nPsychedelics\n\nPsychology\n\nRelationships\n\nSelf\n\nSexuality\n\nSpirituality\n\nTravel\n\nSociety\n\nBasic Income\n\nCities\n\nEducation\n\nElection 2020\n\nEnvironment\n\nEquality\n\nFuture\n\nGun Control\n\nHistory\n\nImmigration\n\nJustice\n\nLanguage\n\nLGBTQIA\n\nMedia\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPolitics\n\nPrivacy\n\nRace\n\nReligion\n\nSan Francisco\n\nTransportation\n\nWomen\n\nWorld\n\nDoes Being Featured in Multiple Topics Result in Exponentially More Article Views?\n\nThis is a question I have been asked a lot.

        "title": "Almost Every Man I Know Is Falling Apart Because of Social Distancing",
        "text": "Almost Every Man I Know Is Falling Apart Because of Social Distancing\n\nMen tend to experience depression in ways tailor made to leave us hanging in a pandemic.\n\nBy Jer\u00f3nimo Roure\n\nThere\u2019s no getting around it. This winter is already horrible, and it\u2019s going to get worse.\n\nNot sure how much more I can take. The constant death, the social isolation, the widespread unemployment, the closing of my favorite small businesses.\n\nWhat\u2019s hardest, though, is watching people I love struggle. Seeing them cope in unhealthy ways. Worrying about their increased drinking and drugging, their fake \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2019s\u201d, their unraveling relationships, their closing off and going inward.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s like I\u2019m all that\u2019s keeping them from jumping into a black hole.\n\nSometimes I just want to shake them, yelling \u201cWake the fuck up!\u201d\n\nSometimes I\u2019m annoyed that it seems like no one\u2019s helping me help them.\n\nSometimes I\u2019m pissed at the government for leaving so many of my friends and neighbors hanging.\n\nSometimes I beg the Universe for mercy. I\u2019ve got a regular meditation practice, a therapist, a good job, a stable family, and plenty of close friends. And I\u2019m barely staying halfway sane.\n\nSometimes I want someone to hold me and pet my hair and tell me everything\u2019s going to be alright.\n\nMostly, I\u2019m exhausted. We\u2019re in the middle of this thing, and who knows when it ends?\n\nThe men in my life are struggling the most\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to notice is that my friends who are struggling the most are men.\n\nThis is not to say that others aren\u2019t struggling too. It\u2019s just that men tend to experience depression in ways tailor made to leave us hanging in a pandemic.\n\nWe often hide our vulnerability in fear of being less \u201cmanly.\u201d We tend to have more \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder\u201d interactions \u2014 like playing or watching sports \u2014 than deep, connected, face-to-face friendships. We tend to avoid doing anything that would make us seem \u201cneedy.\u201d\n\nThis causes all the toxic shit that gives so many men a bad rap: isolation, emotional numbness, angry outbursts, binge drinking.\n\nNo wonder some 80 percent of people who die of suicide in the U.S. are men.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that men deserve attention more than anyone else. Women have been taking care of men\u2019s emotional needs \u2014 without acknowledgement, without reciprocity, without pay \u2014 for way too long.\n\nI\u2019m just saying most of the men in my life are depressed right now. And I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nYou are not alone\n\nI also wanted you to know that if it feels like you\u2019re holding everyone else up right now, you\u2019re not alone. I see you.\n\nMaybe the Serenity Prayer will resonate with you like it does with me?\n\n\u201cGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\u201d\n\nIf the word \u201cGod\u201d turns you off, just take it out.\n\nThe point is, I can\u2019t save my friends. What I can do is make sure they know that I\u2019m here for them, that I\u2019m curious how they\u2019re doing, and that they aren\u2019t \u201cweak\u201d for struggling during the biggest crisis of our lifetimes.\n\nEverything else, I just have to let go of. There\u2019s no way around it. Maybe letting go just isn\u2019t supposed to feel good.",

        "title": "Writing Challenges & Prompts",
        "text": "Section 1: List of Challenges and Related Stories\n\nChallenge 1: Create a story featuring your best stories.\n\nThis story, similar to your bios, is expected to showcase your writing capabilities. This story can include around five stories. You may consider even one story with details at a minimum.\n\nHowever, the maximum is ten articles to make it a readable piece. It will be helpful to use a standard title such as \u201cBest Stories of [Insert Your Name]\u201d. You can choose your preferred subtitle. I plan to compile each story and include them in our promotion pack. This exercise can create visibility to your profile and stories. If you require further clarification, you can open a discussion thread on our Slack channel, and I will provide my input and guidance.\n\nWe compile stories submitted as response to this challenge in the attached story. We also distribute this story to our readers in our daily distribution list and newsletter.\n\nChallenge 2: Create a story featuring the best stories of your selected writers.\n\nNow that we have the best of best stories as assessed by the writers, as part of our cross-pollination goals, I want to propose each writer to choose one or more writers and review their stories from their selected stories.\n\nYou need to review each story in a bundle. Leave a comment, tweet the story and write a brief note about what you learnt from each story. You share your views of the reviewed stories in your story titled \u201cReview of Stories [Insert Name]\u201d.\n\nThere are five reasons for recommending this activity. Our publication was established based on cross-pollination, reciprocity, diversity, collaboration, synergy, and serendipity principles. Here are my ideas:\n\n1. You have a new powerful story opportunity to feature someone\u2019s work. 2. You get a chance of reviewing several articles from a single writer and gain a deeper understanding of this specific writer. 3. You build a stronger relationship with the writer and turn that writer to your fan. 4. You learn new writing styles, discover new topics, and broaden your knowledge. 5. This activity can undoubtedly create serendipity.\n\nWe keep the stories submitted as response to this challenge in the same story for easy access and distribution.\n\nChallenge 3: Create testimonials for your favorite writers.\n\nTo support our cross-pollination values, I recommend you to create at least one testimonial for another writer whom you admire. Please introduce your selected writer, including some sample stories. I plan to use these testimonials as an extension to our writer bios. As you know, 250+ writers presented their bios. We share these bios with our readers. Some readers have already become familiar with some writers, and they specifically ask more stories from them. It is an honor for our writers. Adding testimonials to our distribution list can further enhance the visibility of our writers.\n\nI provided some sample testimonials in this bulletin.\n\nChallenge 4: Create theme-based stories to prepare for curation.\n\nI plan to create a new theme-based article collection to give a great reading experience to our followers. Some readers want to explore stories based on classified themes.\n\nThe purpose of this collection is to categorize stories based on keywords. For example, the first concept I propose is writing an article about \u201cjealousy\u201d.\n\nBased on your experience and background, you can create a story with an attractive title of your choice as long as you use the term \u201cjealousy\u201d is identifiable in your title or subtitle. You can choose relevant tags.\n\nI believe you can create unique stories by looking at the term from your angle.\n\nOne of the objectives of this new challenge is to increase the chance of curation. Therefore, we need to consider some preparation work.\n\nThe articles in this challenge must adhere to Medium curation guidelines.\n\nYou may consider your stories to get peer-reviewed by sharing your draft with one of your fans. If you don\u2019t have fans yet, you can request reviewers in our Slack channel.\n\nYou can gain ideas from the curated articles. For example, you can check the presentation and styles of curated articles. One way of finding curated articles is to check the Medium topics.\n\nYou can also review the stories curated from our publication writers.\n\nChallenge 5: Share your monthly gems.\n\nThe purpose of this writing challenge is to enhance collaboration and build a relationship with your readers. This challenge may reflect your monthly experience with your followers.\n\nI propose writing a story each month describing who you followed and what you explored from these followers. You can tag the follower account and write in a way that you are conversing with this specific follower. For example, I found your story XYZ and found the following points interesting. My take away points from your story were XYZ.\n\nYou can select as many followers and their stories as you explored within a month. I recommend these stories in a conversational tone to the owner of the content and aiming to give useful, practical, thought-provoking, entertaining, inspiring, motivating points to your readers.\n\nWe aim to kill two birds with one stone. While showing our appreciation to the content owner, we can also provide useful content to our readers.\n\nTo collect these stories in the repository and distribute to our readers, we need to standardize the heading. Your story heading can be \u201cMonthly Gems Discovered by [Insert Your Name]\u201d, and you can put an attractive sub-title. You can even choose a kicker \u201cILLUMINATION Writing Challenge\u201d.",

        "text": "Chrissy Teigen Lost Her Baby After Folks Trashed Her \u201cTMI\u201d Tweet\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why her brand of vulnerability matters.\n\nChrissy Teigen | Twitter\n\nAs I scrolled through Twitter a couple of days ago, I caught one of Chrissy Teigen\u2019s tweets, and some of the responses were appalling.\n\nWriting an update on her pregnancy with husband John Legend, Chrissy wrote:\n\nJust had a really scary morning \ud83d\ude29 huge clot, almost save-worthy. The scramble to hear the heartbeat seemed like hours. I never thought I\u2019d relief sigh so much in my liiiiife\n\nOne user who calls themselves \u201cRob\u201d asked,\n\nWhy post such personal information on this or any other public platform?\n\nAnother user going by the name of \u201cJack\u201d chimed in too:\n\nI wouldnt come on social media to talk abo[ut] my root canal either. Tbh I don\u2019t see the need to tell anyone my business\n\nThen, there was Hautechick69:\n\nJust because you have a gazillion followers doesn\u2019t mean you should post EVERYTHING at ALL TIMES. Sometimes you have to have class.\n\nSomeone called Cheryl wrote:\n\nI\u2019m all about sharing personal information like this w/close friends who could offer support, but to put it on the internet for complete strangers to see? Why would u want to share such a personal thing w/thousands of total strangers? Boundaries? Sincerely glad all is well though\n\nThe audacity of Rob and company enraged me. I sarcastically tweeted:\n\nUm, can we get a list of approved topics of conversation for women on social media, please? White men, I know you\u2019re just itching to put in your six cents \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd in another tweet, I wrote:\n\nSome white dude on a horse (that\u2019s literally his Twitter profile pic) tried shaming @chrissyteigen for talking about a miscarriage scare bc that\u2019s \"so personal.\" Now ask me why I\u2019m such a \"TMI\" writer. Bc there are men who think they know what women shouldn\u2019t talk about.\n\nThe saddest thing about all of this is that Chrissy and John wound up losing the baby. After that first tweet about the blood clot scare, Chrissy posted two more heartbreaking updates. The first contained these two images:\n\nImage text:\n\nWe are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we\u2019ve never felt before. We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions,\" the post said. It just wasn\u2019t enough. We never decide on our babies' names until the last possible moment after they\u2019re born, right before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever. To our Jack \u2014 I\u2019m so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn\u2019t give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you. Thank you to everyone who has been sending us positive energy, thoughts and prayers. We feel all of your love and truly appreciate you. On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it.\n\nThe second update was this:\n\nDriving home from the hospital with no baby. How can this be real.\n\nAfter the updates, thousands of fans and followers expressed their condolences, yet others still felt the need for trash talk.\n\nDr. Jen Gunter replied, \u201cThere is nothing worse. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d And then this happened:\n\nTweet text:\n\nYou\u2019re wrong. There IS something worse. When the baby dies, but on purpose, at the mothers\u2019 choosing. That\u2019s much, much worse.\n\nReading that, I just about lost it. I understand that this is just one of the millions of social media interactions that happen in a flash, but it\u2019s one more reminder that pro-lifers (oxymoron, I know) across the country will use any excuse to bring up abortion. Even to downplay another woman\u2019s pregnancy loss.\n\nGod. Sometimes, I hate social media.",

        "text": "Practical Examples\n\nIterators\n\nIn Python, iteration allows us to go over a list of items to perform particular operations. One common way to create an iteration is to use the for loops, which have the following general format.\n\nfor i in iterable:\n\nexpression\n\nAs discussed in my previous article, we can create our custom iterators that can be used as iterables in the for loops. To satisfy the \u201cduck testing\u201d for iterators, the custom class needs to implement the __iter__() and __next__() methods. A specific example is given below.\n\nDuck Typing in Iterators\n\nIn the above code snippet, we implemented both __iter__() and __next__() methods that make the instances of the custom class Cubes iterators, such that the instance was able to be used in a for loop.\n\nCallables\n\nBesides the built-in dict data type, another important dictionary type is defaultdict , available in the collections module. This dictionary-like data type has the following constructor: defaultdict([default_factory[, ...]]) . Specifically, the default_factory argument is a type of callable, such as a function or lambda function.\n\nIn my previous article, I showed that we could utilize the defaultdict by passing a lambda function. Here\u2019s the example of its usage.\n\n>>> from collections import defaultdict\n\n>>> letter_counts = defaultdict(lambda: 0)\n\n>>> for i in 'abcddddeeeee':\n\n... letter_counts[i] += 1\n\n...\n\n>>> letter_counts.items()\n\ndict_items([('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('c', 1), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)])\n\nNotably, we can have better flexibility to use the defaultdict data type if we create our own default factory. With the \u201cduck typing\u201d philosophy, the custom class needs to implement the __call__() method, which is to make something callable. Let\u2019s see how it works.\n\nDuck Typing in Callables\n\nAs shown in the above code, we create the DucklingFactory class, whose __call__() function returns a list of one Duckling instance. Using this factory function, we\u2019ll be able to make the desired number of ducklings by multiplying the default duckling list.\n\nSorting With Len()\n\nAnother possible usage of duck typing is to implement the custom len() function, which can be used in sorting a list using the sort() function. As a side note, some people refer to the len() function as a magic function, because it\u2019s implemented by calling the __len__() function behind the scene (those functions with double underscores as prefix and suffix are called magic functions).\n\nSuppose that we want to sort a list of ducks based on the length of the name of each duck. Here\u2019s how we can apply the duck typing in this case.\n\nDuck Typing in Sorting\n\nIn the above code snippet, the custom NamedDuck class implements the __str__() and __len__() functions, which enable us to use the str() and len() functions on its instances in Lines 10 and 12, respectively. Importantly, as you can see, although the list is mixed with named ducks and strings, all elements can call the str() and len() functions, such that the list can be sorted using the len() as the key and used in the list comprehension when we want to print out the sorted result.\n\nThus, the broader implication of this usage is that when we have a mixed list of elements of different data types, as long as each data type implements the same functions, the elements will pass the duck testing and be applied with the proper operations. Here\u2019s a general use case example using the len() function on a mixed list of data types of str , tuple , and list .",

This is for compatibility with Seaborn, but in a real machine learning context you will need to perform additional steps to ensure you avoid leakage and other undesired side effects of sloppy data preparation.\n\nNote also that in all instances we use blue to represent \u201csurvived\u201d, green to represent \u201cdid not survive\u201d, yellow to represent \u201c1st class\u201d, orange to represent \u201c2nd class\u201d, and red to represent \u201c3rd class\u201d. When showing different representations of the same data, it\u2019s important to use meaningful colors to help the reader follow the meaning of the visualization.\n\nNumeric vs. Categorical EDA\n\nThese code snippets represent alternatives for the first scatter plot shown above, plotting Age (a numeric value) against the target Survived (a categorical value).\n\nMultiple Histograms\n\nRather than using the y -axis to represent the two categories, let\u2019s use two different colors. That means that we can use the y -axis to represent counts rather than trying to discern this information from the density of dots.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\nax.hist(df[df[\"Survived\"]==1][\"Age\"], bins=15, alpha=0.5, color=\"blue\", label=\"survived\")\n\nax.hist(df[df[\"Survived\"]==0][\"Age\"], bins=15, alpha=0.5, color=\"green\", label=\"did not survive\")\n\n\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Age\")\n\nax.set_ylabel(\"Count of passengers\")\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Age vs. Survival for Titanic Passengers\")\n\n\n\nax.legend();\n\nMultiple Density Estimate Plots\n\nThis is showing largely the same information as the histograms, except that it\u2019s a density estimate (estimate of the probability density function) rather than a count across bins. Seaborn has nice built-in functionality for this.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\nsns.kdeplot(df[df[\"Survived\"]==1][\"Age\"], shade=True, color=\"blue\", label=\"survived\", ax=ax)\n\nsns.kdeplot(df[df[\"Survived\"]==0][\"Age\"], shade=True, color=\"green\", label=\"did not survive\", ax=ax)\n\n\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Age\")\n\nax.set_ylabel(\"Density\")\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Age vs. Survival for Titanic Passengers\");\n\nMultiple Box Plots\n\nHere we lose some of the information about the distribution overall in order to focus in on particular summary statistics of the distribution.\n\nDcbmariano / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\nsns.boxplot(x=\"Age\", y=\"Survived\", data=df, orient=\"h\", palette={1:\"blue\", 0:\"green\"}, ax=ax)\n\n\n\nax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Age vs. Survival for Titanic Passengers\")\n\n\n\ncolor_patches = [\n\nPatch(facecolor=\"blue\", label=\"survived\"),\n\nPatch(facecolor=\"green\", label=\"did not survive\")\n\n]\n\nax.legend(handles=color_patches);\n\nCategorical vs. Categorical EDA\n\nThese code snippets represent alternatives for the second scatter plot shown above, plotting Pclass (a categorical value) against the target Survived (a categorical value).\n\nGrouped Bar Charts\n\nThis shows the distribution across the categories, similar to the \u201cmultiple histograms\u201d example for numeric vs. categorical.\n\nFirst, an example where Pclass is represented along the x -axis and Survival is represented by color, essentially answering the question for each passenger class, how many passengers survived vs. did not survive?\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\nsns.catplot(\"Pclass\", hue=\"Survived\", data=df, kind=\"count\",\n\npalette={1:\"blue\", 0:\"green\"}, ax=ax)\n\n\n\nplt.close(2) # catplot creates an extra figure we don't need\n\n\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Passenger Class\")\n\n\n\ncolor_patches = [\n\nPatch(facecolor=\"blue\", label=\"survived\"),\n\nPatch(facecolor=\"green\", label=\"did not survive\")\n\n]\n\nax.legend(handles=color_patches)\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Passenger Class vs. Survival for Titanic Passengers\");\n\nSecond, an example where Survival is represented along the x -axis and Pclass is represented by color, essentially answering the question for passengers who survived vs. did not survive, how many were in each passenger class?\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\nsns.catplot(\"Survived\", hue=\"Pclass\", data=df, kind=\"count\",\n\npalette={1:\"yellow\", 2:\"orange\", 3:\"red\"}, ax=ax)\n\n\n\nplt.close(2) # catplot creates an extra figure we don't need\n\n\n\nax.legend(title=\"Passenger Class\")\n\nax.set_xticklabels([\"did not survive\", \"survived\"])\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Passenger Class vs. Survival for Titanic Passengers\");\n\nStacked Bar Charts\n\nThese can be used for counts (same as grouped bar charts) but if you use percentages rather than counts, they show proportions. Basically like a pie chart but better, because you are visually comparing heights rather than angles.\n\nThis requires a bit of dataframe manipulation to prepare for plotting:\n\n# Create a dataframe with the counts by passenger class and survival\n\n# [\"Name\"] could be any column within the data; it is the equivalent\n\n# of COUNT(id) in SQL counts_df = df.groupby([\"Pclass\", \"Survived\"])[\"Name\"].count().unstack()\n\nFirst, an example where Pclass is represented along the x -axis and Survival is represented by color, essentially answering the question for each passenger class, what proportion of passengers survived vs. did not survive?\n\n# Transpose so survived + did not survive add up to 1, divide by the total number (transposed), then transpose one more time for plotting\n\nsurvived_percents_df = counts_df.T.div(counts_df.T.sum()).T fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\nsurvived_percents_df.plot(kind=\"bar\", stacked=True, color=[\"green\", \"blue\"], ax=ax)\n\n\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Passenger Class\")\n\nax.set_xticklabels([1, 2, 3], rotation=0)\n\nax.set_ylabel(\"Proportion\")\n\n\n\ncolor_patches = [\n\nPatch(facecolor=\"blue\", label=\"survived\"),\n\nPatch(facecolor=\"green\", label=\"did not survive\")\n\n]\n\nax.legend(handles=color_patches)\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Passenger Class vs. Survival for Titanic Passengers\");\n\nSecond, an example where Survival is represented along the x -axis and Pclass is represented by color, essentially answering the question for passengers who survived vs. did not survive, what proportion were in each passenger class?\n\n# Divide by the total number and transpose for plotting\n\npclass_percents_df = counts_df.div(counts_df.sum()).T fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n\n\npclass_percents_df.plot(kind=\"bar\", stacked=True, color=[\"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\"], ax=ax)\n\n\n\nax.legend(title=\"Passenger Class\")\n\nax.set_xticklabels([\"did not survive\", \"survived\"], rotation=0)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\nax.set_ylabel(\"Proportion\")\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Passenger Class vs. Survival for Titanic Passengers\");\n\nNumeric vs. Numeric vs. Categorical EDA\n\nSometimes it\u2019s interesting to see the relationship between two different numeric features and the target, not just one at a time. This code snippet represents an alternative for the third scatter plot shown above, plotting Age (a numeric feature) vs. Fare (a numeric feature) vs. Survived (a categorical target).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))\n\n\n\nax.scatter(df[df[\"Survived\"]==1][\"Age\"], df[df[\"Survived\"]==1][\"Fare\"], c=\"blue\", alpha=0.5)\n\nax.scatter(df[df[\"Survived\"]==0][\"Age\"], df[df[\"Survived\"]==0][\"Fare\"], c=\"green\", alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Age\")\n\nax.set_ylabel(\"Fare\")\n\n\n\ncolor_patches = [\n\nLine2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', label='survived', markerfacecolor='b', markersize=10),\n\nLine2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', label='did not survive', markerfacecolor='g', markersize=10)\n\n]\n\nax.legend(handles=color_patches)\n\n\n\nfig.suptitle(\"Survival by Age and Fare for Titanic Passengers\");\n\nSummary\n\nMost of the time if your target is a categorical variable, the best EDA visualization isn\u2019t going to be a basic scatter plot. Instead, consider:\n\nNumeric vs. Categorical (e.g. Survived vs. Age )\n\nMultiple histograms\n\nMultiple density estimate plots\n\nMultiple box plots\n\nCategorical vs. Categorical (e.g. Survived vs. Pclass )\n\nGrouped bar charts\n\nStacked bar charts\n\nNumeric vs. Numeric vs. Categorical (e.g. Age vs. Fare vs. Survived )",

        "text": "When I\u2019m coaching a writer, I try to be mindful of the fact that for some people, the concept of making a big goal can be \u2014 fraught.\n\nSome people have anxiety that looks like worrying about the other shoe falling. If something good happens, they are on edge waiting for something bad to balance it.\n\nSome people struggle with feelings of failure if they fall anywhere short of perfect completion of a goal.\n\nSome people are derailed by disappointment.\n\nAnd guess what. That\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not here to convince you to dream outside your comfort zone. But I am here to share my philosophy with you. Do with it what works for you.\n\nHere goes.\n\nDreaming is Worthwhile in its Own Right\n\nThere\u2019s real value in the act of getting your hopes up. I personally do it every chance I can. It might be the only good thing that will come out of trying something new.\n\nWhy would I give that up?\n\nMy actually philosophy is this: I get my hopes up as often as possible, and work toward those goals one little step at a time.\n\nI don\u2019t always get where I hoped I would. In fact, let\u2019s face it, usually I don\u2019t. For many reasons. Sometimes I get started and change directions. Sometimes I just can\u2019t make it happen the way I want it to. Sometimes life gets in the way.\n\nBut if I take little steps \u2014 if I direct my daily habit \u2014 toward my goal, I get somewhere.\n\nI started out meaning to be a romance writer. I write children\u2019s books.\n\nI started out meaning to make my living writing novels. I wouldn\u2019t give up teaching for anything.\n\nThere are so many unknowns in this business. One of the few things you can control is how much enjoyment you let yourself take from getting your hopes up.\n\nStart Big Picture and Go Small\n\nHere\u2019s how I think about habits.\n\nYou start with a BIG idea.\n\nIt can be something you want to start, like: I want to write a novel. I want to finish an Ironman. I want to learn to play the guitar.\n\nIt can be something you want to stop, like: I want to stop smoking. I want to stop eating processed foods. I want to stop leaving my kitchen a mess after dinner.\n\nThe process is the same. You have this lovely, big idea \u2014 and then you find the smallest component of it. In the samples above, those components might be:\n\nWriting for ten minutes\n\nExercising for ten minutes\n\nPracticing for ten minutes\n\nNot smoking a cigarette before noon every day\n\nNot eating processed foods for one meal\n\nMaking sure the dishwasher is empty before dinner every night\n\nOn their own, there\u2019s nothing very exciting about any of those. Do them once and \u2014 yeah, nothing much. But do them over and over and over again? Do that and they become habits that take on a life of their own.\n\nHabit Becomes a Challenge When it\u2019s Time Bound\n\nI know the conventional wisdom says that it takes three weeks. I\u2019ve found that for me it\u2019s more like three months. If I do something every day for three months, I have time to see real progress and it becomes just part of my life.\n\nMy favorite way to do this is something I call a 10X100 (or ten by one hundred.)\n\nI pick a thing and do it for ten minutes a day for 100 days. Keeping a log helps with accountability. Blogging about it can be super helpful, if you\u2019re into that kind of thing. Or just write about it on social media, if you want some outside pressure to meet your goal.\n\nGo ahead and get your hopes up about where this might lead. But be open to the idea that your challenge might take you somewhere on day 100 that you can\u2019t even imagine on day 1.\n\nHow Will You Challenge Yourself?\n\nSo, think about your big picture. What do you want to get your hopes up about. Then choose a little bitty habit that represents the tiniest little component of that goal.\n\nThen do it for 100 days. Don\u2019t worry about where it will lead. Just do it today, then do it tomorrow, and so on. See what happens.\n\nWhen the habit is set, do it again.",

        "text": "We\u2019re three days away from starting the writing part of the Blog-Your-Own-Book Challenge.\n\nThree days from a goal of writing 31 blog posts in 31 days, all on the same topic, that come together into a book.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nJust in case, came up with tips for you. I hope they help.\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve chosen the right topic.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to a ton of writers in the last month about their BYOB projects. One thing comes up over and over that I want to talk about for a minute.\n\nYour topic should not be your entire empire.\n\nYour empire = the business you want to build around your writing. AKA, your niche. My empire is \u2018teaching people how to become writers.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s way too big a topic for my BYOB project. Like I said, it\u2019s my entire empire. I had to find a little slice of my niche to focus on for 31 days. For me, that\u2019s \u2018how to create a writing habit.\u2019\n\nIn 31 days, I could skim along the surface of my whole niche. But the point of the BYOB Challenge is to go deep on one little part of it.\n\nThink about your empire, the whole of your niche, and then choose one thing you can teach your audience about that thing. If you\u2019re a fiction writer, that might be telling a series of connected short stories set in the world of your novel. If you\u2019re an essayist, it might be delving into one specific thought or idea. If you\u2019re a teacher-writer, maybe you\u2019ll do what I\u2019m doing and teach something on a deeper level than you could with a single blog post.\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve got your posts pre-planned.\n\nOnce you have your topic narrowed down, try this exercise. Think about five or six themes within the topic. What are a few topics that your main topic can break down into?\n\nMy BYOB project, creating a daily writing habit, breaks down to these themes:\n\nTiny goals\n\nGoal stacking\n\nRamping up to a daily goal\n\nObjectives and Key Results\n\nWriting as a job\n\nand resources\n\nOnce you have your topic\u2019s themes decided, you\u2019ll just have to come up with five or six blog posts you can write about that theme.\n\nMy best advice, in the next few days, is to use the PSST framework on each of those post ideas, if you haven\u2019t already. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing today and tomorrow. Having those posts planned out will make writing them so much easier.\n\nAnd more likely.\n\nMake sure you know how you\u2019ll capture your audience.\n\nOne of the reasons we\u2019re writing our books as blog posts is so that we can start to build an audience for the finished project. In order to do that, you need to make sure you\u2019re set up for capturing your readers so you can reach out to them.\n\nYep. That means building an email list. And that means having an opt-in on your blog posts.\n\nI wrote a pretty exhaustive post, with about a million screenshots, about how exactly to do that. Be sure to read that and choose your opt-in, then get your email server set up to receive those new subscribers.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re ready to meet this goal.\n\nThe last thing I want you to do in the next three days is be sure that you\u2019re ready to actually achieve the goal you\u2019ve set for yourself.\n\nThat means having time set aside to write your blog post. And a space for doing the work. It means getting your mind wrapped around the idea that for the month of August, writing a blog post everyday is part of your job as writer. It\u2019s not a hobby. At least not for this month.\n\nSet aside perfectionism. Set aside fear. You\u2019ve got this. You\u2019re going to rock it.\n\nNinja Writers is hosting daily write-ins \u2014 quiet writing time on Zoom \u2014 and we\u2019ve got nearly daily workshop calls in August. We\u2019d love to have you join us for the month. It\u2019s free.",

        "title": "Long-Covid Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Treatments: New Insights",
        "text": "Long-Covid Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Treatments: New Insights\n\nMore than 5 initial symptoms predict long-Covid. And a drug just passed phase III clinical trial for chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nHand vector created by freepik \u2014 www.freepik.com\n\nAs with any other systemic disease, Covid-19 may bring systemic complications that may not resolve so soon. We identify them as long-haulers, long-Covid, post-viral Covid-19 syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Importantly, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test is not important for long-Covid diagnosis.\n\nWe understand what they look like and the probable causes. But how much do we know about its risk factors, namely, what traits make a patient more likely to develop long-Covid, and its potential treatments?\n\nPrevalence and cause\n\nThe prevalence of long-Covid depends on the population studied. For example, a study in China detected residual lung abnormalities in 25% of discharged Covid-19 patients in a 3-month follow-up, of whom 31% still had gastrointestinal distress, 18% had headaches, 16% had fatigue, and 15% had dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\nA study in Italy, on the other hand, followed 179 Covid-19 patients for two months. They uncovered one or two lingering symptoms in 32% of patients and three or more in 55%. Common symptoms were fatigue (53%), dyspnea (43%), joint pain (27%), and chest pain (22%).\n\nOther data from King\u2019s College London that studied over 4000 Covid-19 patients found that 13% of patients had persisting symptoms for at least 28 days, of which over 90% had fatigue and headache. This study further discovered a few risk factors for long-Covid, as discussed below.\n\nReasons for Covid-19 long-haulers, scientists believe, are due to the residual tissue damage or the aberrant immune responses that persist despite that the coronavirus may no longer be present, or both. More details here:\n\nRisk factors\n\nTwo new preprints released in October have tracked a sufficient number of Covid-19 patients to identify the possible risk factors of long-haulers. While preprints have not gone through peer-review yet, these two are from research institutions with a good academic publishing record.\n\nThe presence of more than five symptoms during the first week of illness predicted 16.3% of cases [of long-Covid].\n\nPart I: King\u2019s College London\n\nResearchers at King\u2019s College London authored one of the preprints, titled \u201cAttributes and predictors of Long-COVID: analysis of COVID cases and their symptoms collected by the Covid Symptoms Study App.\u201d This study is led by Claire J. Steves, an honorary consultant physician in geriatric medicine and deputy director of the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, with over 70 published academic papers.\n\nThis study followed 4,182 Covid-19 patients in Sweden, Great Britain, and the U.S. for several months. In the end, they found 13% of patients had symptoms lasting more than 28 days. This number was 4.5% and 2.3% for those suffering symptoms for more than 56 and 95 days, respectively.\n\nThe study then pinpointed risk factors that all together could predict 76.7% of long-Covid cases. The researchers also tested their predictive model in another dataset of 2,472 Covid-19 patients, which proved their model\u2019s accuracy and generalizability. Individual risk factors are ranked as follows:\n\nThe old age of 70 years and above predicted 29.2% of cases. The presence of more than five symptoms during the first week of illness predicted 16.3% of cases. A high body mass index of 27.5 and above predicted 10.3% of cases. Horse voice symptoms predicted 4.1% of cases. Shortness of breath symptom predicted 3.8% of cases. Female sex predicted 3.7% of cases. In those aged 70 and above, fever, loss of smell, and comorbidities (particularly heart and lung diseases) were also predictors. Socioeconomic status was not a predictor.\n\nLastly, the authors pointed out their study\u2019s limitations, which include the dominance of females and those younger than 70 years. Data on race were also lacking, preventing risk factor analysis. And data relied on self-reports, which may not be as accurate as doctors\u2019 assessments.\n\nRegardless, both studies identified more than five initial symptoms and shortness of breath as predictors of long-Covid.\n\nPart II: Helix\n\nThe second preprint, \u201cLong-term COVID-19 symptoms in a large unselected population,\u201d is from Helix, a population genomics research center in California. This study used survey data from over 20,000 participants of the Helix DNA Discovery and Healthy Nevada Projects. But only 233 people had Covid-19, and most were not tested. Prevalence of long-Covid was 42%, 34%, and 24% after 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively.\n\nThis study only found three risk factors of long-Covid: more than five initial symptoms, shortness of breath, and blood type A+. In contrast, sex, BMI, or comorbidities were not associated with long-Covid.\n\nEvidently, this study is weaker than the King\u2019s College London study Dr. Steves led \u2014 owing to the smaller sample size while also using self-reports. Regardless, both studies identified more than five initial symptoms and shortness of breath as predictors of long-Covid.\n\nSubtypes and unique symptoms\n\nAnother interesting finding from Dr. Steves\u2019s study were the two subtypes of long-Covid. One type is the combo of fatigue, headache, and upper respiratory tract symptoms like shortness of breath, sore throat, persistent cough, or smell loss. The second type is a multi-system complication with ongoing fever and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nAlthough rare, science has recently described new and unique aspects of long-Covid ranging from symptoms of the heart, brain, peripheral nervous system, ear, and skin.\n\nDr. Steves et al. also noticed a few symptoms unique to long-Covid. Using short-Covid-19 patients as a comparison group, these were cardiac symptoms like palpitations or tachycardia (6.1% vs. 0.5%), concentration or memory problems (4.1% vs. 0.2%), tinnitus and earache (3.6% vs. 0.2%), and peripheral nerve symptoms like prickling or tingling sensation and numbness (2% vs. 0.5%). These differences reached statistical significance (p<0.05), which means that results were not due to random chance.\n\nIn a study published this month, Harvard Medical School scientists searched for cases of Covid-19-related skin symptoms in the American Academy of Dermatology and International League of Dermatological Societies databases. They identified 171 such cases from 31 countries. While most skin symptoms lasted less than a month, pernio, chilblains, or redness and swelling of feet or hands\u2014also known as Covid-19 toes \u2014 persisted more than 60 days in six cases and more than 130 days in two cases.\n\nAlthough rare, science has recently described new and unique aspects of long-Covid ranging from symptoms of the heart, brain, peripheral nervous system, ear, and skin.\n\nPossible treatments\n\nAt this point, the guidelines for Covid-19 long-haulers include proper sleep, nutrition, and mental health management. Slow and gradual pacing of physical activities is also recommended but should be avoided if symptoms worsen.\n\nAccording to an unpublished study of 1,600 Covid-19 long-haulers, the self-reported supplements that helped with symptom relieve were vitamin D (500 people), vitamin C (290), zinc (250), magnesium (259), B12 (228), multivitamins (184), turmeric (156), N-acetylcysteine (134), and others. While these are anecdotes, they make sense since proper nutrition is advice for long-Covid recovery. Self-reported prescriptions were heartburn or acid reflux medications (230 people), steroids (221), antihistamines (215), inhalers (196), aspirin (80), ibuprofen (74), and others.\n\n\u201cRintatolimod is the only drug to have completed successful advanced placebo-controlled clinical trials (Phase II/III) for ME/CFS and is approved for severe ME/CFS in Argentina.\u201d\n\nLong-Covid is a syndrome similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Presently, there are no approved treatments for ME/CFS, but that may soon change. A phase III clinical trial of 75 sufferers of ME/CFS for 2\u20138 years was published a few days ago. And results found that an immunomodulatory called rintatolimod improved the exercise duration of 51% of patients. In contrast, only 17.6% of the placebo group saw improvement. That is nearly a tripled efficacy in terms of the number of responders.\n\n\u201cRintatolimod is the only drug to have completed successful advanced placebo-controlled clinical trials (Phase II/III) for ME/CFS and is approved for severe ME/CFS in Argentina,\u201d the authors wrote, which may apply to long-Covid as well. \u201cCovid-19 debilitated patients with \u201clong hauler\u201d post-viral syndrome would benefit from rintatolimod are topics for further investigation.\u201d Rintatolimod is now being investigated for its antiviral potential against Covid-19 in Japan.",

        "title": "The how, when, and what of AI",
        "text": "1. How probable is it that we\u2019ll develop AI that is smarter than humans?\n\nOf the three questions, this is the least fun but also, perhaps, the easiest to answer. At a recent conference comprised of the people most involved in working in the field of artificial intelligence, participants were asked when human-level intelligence would be achieved and less than 2% of the respondents believed the answer to be never. This poll asked specifically about AGI and not ASI, however, many people (including me) believe that the difficult task is developing a sufficiently advanced AI that can teach itself new things (AGI) and that a super intelligent version will emerge quite quickly thereafter. Some think this this emergence could take years or decades once we arrive at AGI. Others warn that it could be just a matter of hours after that first AGI is developed due to the speed of recursive self-improvement. It is this capacity for recursive self-improvement that many software engineers are indeed hoping to instill in their programs to speed development. It is also this ability that could very easily see our world go from no human-level AI\u2019s to one to the first super-human AI very rapidly.\n\nWhile there are still a few skeptics who believe we will never develop human-level intelligence or that it won\u2019t be for hundreds of years, a growing consensus among those closest to these efforts\u2074 believe it will happen, and soon\u2026\n\n2. When might we develop such an AI?\n\nHere\u2019s where we are right now:\n\nWe\u2019re here. But it doesn\u2019t feel like it. We can\u2019t see what will happen just to the right of us. (Wait But Why)\n\nWe\u2019re at this point in time, just before a massive spike in human progress. This has occurred before with the industrial revolution and the advent of the Internet but this spike will dwarf those. Due to the Law of Accelerating Returns \u2014 advancement as an evolutionary process that speeds up exponentially over time \u2014 life in 2040 \u2014 just a scant 23 years away \u2014 may be as different from today as life today is from medieval times. It may be so different that we can no more picture it than could a serf from the middle ages understand the technologies used to create a website or a cellphone.\n\nWhen we consider the timeline and effects of superintelligent AI systems and overlay them on top of our expected lifetimes we see the enormous wondrous and scary impacts that we \u2014 you and I \u2014 can expect. Let\u2019s check in on those same AI researchers for their expert opinions. A large majority (>68%) believed we would develop AGI by 2050 with 43% of respondents believing this would occur by 2030.\n\nSo in 13 to 33 years there is believed to be a good chance that we will have developed a computer program that is at least as intelligent as us. This will include many different types of intelligence including the ability to learn on its own.\n\nIt seems hard to fathom it going this fast. It doesn\u2019t feel like things will advance this quickly. If you\u2019re like me, you read about new tech daily and buy the latest and greatest gadgets and gizmos. The pace of technology advancement is slooooow, right? But our perception is flawed.\n\n\u201cAdvances are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more quickly.\u201d \u2014 Tim Urban\n\nOne of the most optimistic and vocal proponents of this new era being ushered in is Ray Kurzweil. He came up with and bases many of his predictions on the aforementioned Law of Accelerating Returns and expects AGI to arrive by 2029. Again I turn to Wait But Why:\n\n\u201cThe average rate of advancement between 1985 and 2015 was higher than the rate between 1955 and 1985 \u2014 because the former was a more advanced world \u2014 so much more change happened in the most recent 30 years than in the prior 30.\u201d Kurzweil \u201cbelieves another 20th century\u2019s worth of progress happened between 2000 and 2014 and that another 20th century\u2019s worth of progress will happen by 2021, in only seven years. A couple decades later, he believes a 20th century\u2019s worth of progress will happen multiple times in the same year, and even later, in less than one month.\u201d And \u201call in all, that the 21st century will achieve 1,000 times the progress of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nThis is due to the power of exponential growth versus the linear growth of which we often think.\u2075\n\n3. What impact will such development have on humanity?\n\nThe remainder of this post will lay out what life could look like once we are no longer the most (generally) intelligent being on the planet. We\u2019ll touch on both the good and bad outcomes (for humans) and describe some ways in which we could hope to nudge things toward the better outcomes.\n\nIt will likely be impossible to know exactly \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d these AIs are thinking. My guess is they will have advanced through a combination of directed programming and training from humans as well as recursive self-development efforts of their own. Once they can efficiently self-improve, we will quickly lose our ability to know what the hell is going on within them or comprehend what they are doing. It\u2019s not just that an ASI will think a million\u2076 times faster than us, it\u2019s that the quality of the thinking will be that much better.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from Wait But Why that illustrates the gulf between human cognition and that of chimps.\n\n\u201cWhat makes humans so much more intellectually capable than chimps isn\u2019t a difference in thinking speed \u2014 it\u2019s that human brains contain a number of sophisticated cognitive modules that enable things like complex linguistic representations or longterm planning or abstract reasoning, that chimps\u2019 brains do not. Speeding up a chimp\u2019s brain by thousands of times wouldn\u2019t bring him to our level \u2014 even with a decade\u2019s time, he wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out how to use a set of custom tools to assemble an intricate model, something a human could knock out in a few hours. There are worlds of human cognitive function a chimp will simply never be capable of, no matter how much time he spends trying.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that a chimp can\u2019t do what we do, it\u2019s that his brain is unable to grasp that those worlds even exist \u2014 a chimp can become familiar with what a human is and what a skyscraper is, but he\u2019ll never be able to understand that the skyscraper was built by humans. In his world, anything that huge is part of nature, period, and not only is it beyond him to build a skyscraper, it\u2019s beyond him to realize that anyone can build a skyscraper. That\u2019s the result of a small difference in intelligence quality.\n\nAnd in the scheme of the intelligence range we\u2019re talking about today, or even the much smaller range among biological creatures, the chimp-to-human quality intelligence gap is tiny.\u201d\n\nAnd it is tiny. We are pretty close in intellect to chimps \u2014 no offense. In fact, there are intellectual tasks that chimps can perform better than us.\n\nChimps can recognize and recall certain patterns far better than we can. Don\u2019t be so full of yourself.\n\nSo let\u2019s say we now imagine a superintelligent machine that represents a cognitive gap equal to the one between us and the chimp. But in this example, we\u2019re the chimps and the machine is trying to explain things to us that we cannot comprehend. Even these small gaps in level present huge chasms in understanding.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the much larger gap between us and ants. An ant building an anthill on the side of a highway has no idea what that highway is. They cannot possibly comprehend how we built it, for what we use it, what benefits it bestows upon us, or even who we are. Attempting to explain any of this to the ant is a preposterous idea for good reason. Even if we somehow could transmit our language or thoughts to the ants, they are simply not capable of comprehending any of it.\n\nA machine with the sort of smarts we\u2019re talking about would be about as far away from us as we are to ants. The gap would be huge. We could not comprehend what the machine was doing and it would be pointless for the machine to attempt to explain it to us. Tim Urban uses a staircase metaphor to explain this.",

        "title": "How I Created a Self-Published Planner in 72 Hours",
        "text": "This week, I launched my second self-published work, The Thriving Life Planner. It was a work that I wasn\u2019t planning on doing this year and in fact, only had it as an idea about a month ago. But then, I got a cold with a terrible cough which would keep me up at night.\n\nIn the middle of the night during November, I would write down ideas and play with timelines and outlines to keep my mind on my body\u2019s need to cough uncontrollably. And then, one night, it came to me. It was time to create a planner that did everything I wanted it to do.\n\nThe Thriving Life Planner was born.\n\nWhat I wanted in a planner was a place for my life plan, annual goals and monthly goals, annual and monthly calendars, and daily pages to help me achieve these goals. And I didn\u2019t want to pay $50 for it every quarter like I had been doing.\n\nThat is exactly what I created. You can find it here.\n\nHow did I go from idea to proof product in 72 hours?\n\nBefore we go any further, I want you to know something. I decided that if I was going to pursue creating this as a product that I didn\u2019t want to spend any more than a week creating it. Maybe two weeks if getting a proof back took longer.\n\nI had it in my head that this was going to be a quick, crazy idea and I would not let it take months of wasted time if it was merely a delusion of a man who was up later in the night sick with a terrible cold.\n\nStep One: Clarify Your Why\n\nIn between coughing fits, I thought I would start with a one-pager for myself. And it started with one sheet of printer paper. I put a header on top: The Perfect Planner. And then I asked myself the following questions:\n\nWhat do I want in a planner? What do I need in a planner? Is there anything that doesn\u2019t need to be in a planner? Why have other planners not worked? Is this only for me, or would other people be interested in it?\n\nI answered these five questions and decided I would at least create a rough idea design for the planner. And then I would consider doing some research or give up on the idea.\n\n***And to be very honest with you, I decided in the middle of my designing that I was going to create this product no matter if other people wanted it or not. Why? Because, it was a product I have wanted for years, and never found anything that did exactly what I wanted.***\n\nStep Two: Create a Draft\n\nI created my first draft of The Thriving Life Planner in less than two hours. I pulled out the planners and journals I had used in the last four or five years (yes, I keep them) and started looking through them for the things I really liked and the things I didn\u2019t like.\n\nThis helped me focus on my one-pager. And then, on index cards, I started drafting was the inside of the planner would look like for almost every page. After two hours, I had the basic design and information I wanted in the planner.\n\nThis initial draft helped me envision what I was looking for in the planner. And my mind was spent, my cough started to reduce, so I went to bed.\n\nStep Three: Create a Proof Copy\n\nThe following night I was shocked awake by one of my daughters sneaking into our room and scaring the dog so he howled like crazy. This woke me up from a dead sleep and it awakened coughing fits. Once I got everyone else to bed, I was wide awake.\n\nSo, I pulled out my laptop to work on my planner.\n\nI looked at different dimensions for my planner to be first. Once I finished this, I formatted a Pages document on my MacBook for those dimensions and set to work taking the scribes on index cards and turning them into the second draft of sorts.\n\nIt took me about an hour to do this. Since most planners are the same pages over and over again, I only had to format about 20 pages. And then copy and paste them in the appropriate locations.\n\nWith the second draft done, I realized I should take a break from this and moved onto the next step. Mostly, because I was still wide awake, but now it was due to the excitement of a project.\n\nStep Four: Cover Design\n\nFor my first book, Productivity Success, I hired a designer to create my design. In the end, I paid $75 to have them design a cover that I had to hold their hand to get it just right (Or perhaps, they were holding my hand).\n\nNevertheless, I decided I was not going to pay $75 for an idea I still wasn\u2019t sure if it mattered to a lot of other people. So, I went over to Canva and created my own cover. I entered the dimensions for the front and back covers, decided not to do any writing on the spine, and I went to work.\n\nIn less than an hour, I created the front and back cover for my planner and only paid $1 for the main graphic that was on the front cover. How did I come up with a cover design?\n\nFor the cover design, I went and Googled: Self Published Planners. And reviewed all of the covers that came up on the first page. I did the same thing on Amazon. And then I went to Barnes and Noble's website and searched planners. These 20 minutes of research gave me insights into what I was going to do on the front.\n\nIn the end, I spent an hour and a half-ish designing my cover. Then I sent it off to my brother to slap them together so I could upload it to Amazon\u2019s KDP Direct. And then it was morning, so I started my day.\n\nStep Five: Editing\n\nOnce I had everything together, it was time to do some serious editing. I did this on the evening of the second day of all my hard work. And was able to get a lot done from myself and with the help of two other people to make sure I had a good handle on the edits.\n\nAgain, for my first book, Productivity Success, I hired an editor. This cost me something like $250 to edit the book. Since this was not a regular book and still a far-flung idea, I decided to self-edit.\n\n***Warning: Self-editing is a hazardous business. What I did here also involved two other people looking through the initial second draft, and then again after I got the proof back. If you are going to do this, you need to be very vigilant. And to be honest, I probably have errors I haven\u2019t caught yet.***\n\nFirst, I reviewed every written aspect and read it out loud. Then I ran every written aspect through Grammarly. Then again, I used the grammar tools within Pages. I read everything out loud one more time. And then had two friends take a look at everything.\n\nAt this point, the final draft to be sent off for the proof was done. Look back, reviewed this document six times in a self-editing process. It probably isn\u2019t enough, but it catches almost all the major things, hopefully.\n\nStep Six: The Proof\n\nThe next day on the way to work, I stopped at a Starbucks, uploaded my cover and \u2018manuscript\u2019 to KDP Direct. Set up the initial aspects for it and ordered a proof. I had created all of this in 72 hours. And now, all I had to do was wait to see what came back in the proof.\n\nWhat came back was marvelous.\n\nFor the most part.\n\nI did have some more editing to do. Something about seeing it in person helps bring out the issues. But the formatting looked great. The cover looked great. I was shocked at how much I could do in three days' time.\n\nAnd so, I updated the things that needed to be fixed and started test driving my proof.\n\nPublished December 1, 2019\n\nI published the planner this week and could not be happier. And I am going to be honest. If no one buys it, that is fine, because it is the planner I wanted and I paid a total of $12 to create it and get my first one. The beauty is that others have shown their interest and THEY ARE BUYING THEM!\n\nIt is a great sense of accomplishment to know I can create something and make it a reality. And I hope you might find The Thriving Life Planner to be the planner you have been looking for to achieve your dreams.\n\nTwo Things to Remember:\n\nFirst, I decided that I was going to create this because I wanted it. And I didn\u2019t care if anyone else bought it. This is a terrible idea if you are trying to actually sell a product to make money and start an online business. However, this product is for me. And I was fine with it.\n\nSecond, I share all of this so you know it is easy to self-publish something, but I don\u2019t want you to do it carelessly. Put in the work to create something awesome. And spend time reviewing it. I spent a lot of time in the middle of the night because I couldn\u2019t sleep. If you don\u2019t have a ton of time to put into something don\u2019t try to force it out fast.\n\nHave you ever created something like this in a short amount of time? What was it? Share a link in the responses or share what it was and how you did it!",

        "text": "(Originally posted on May 30, 2016 on the LDV Capital blog here.\n\nUpdate April 4, 2017: GrokStyle announced raising $2M. Our annual LDV Vision Summit is May 24\u201325, 2017 in NYC, early bird tickets on sale now!)\n\nEntrepreneurial Computer Vision Challenge Winner: Grokstyle, Sean Bell, CEO & Co-Founder \u00a9Robert Wright/LDV Vision Summit\n\nOur annual LDV Vision Summit has two competitions. Finalists receive a chance to present their wisdom in front of hundreds of top industry executives, venture capitalists, top industry executives and companies recruiting. Winning competitor also wins $5,000 Amazon AWS credits.\n\n1. Startup competition for promising visual technology companies with less than $1.5M in funding?\n\n2. Entrepreneurial Computer Vision Challenge (ECVC) for any Computer Vision and Machine Learning students, professors, experts or enthusiasts working on a unique solution to empower businesses and humanity.\n\nCompetitions are open to anyone working in our visual technology sector such as: empowering photography, videography, medical imaging, analytics, robotics, satellite imaging, computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, autonomous cars, media and entertainment, gesture recognition, search, advertising, cameras, e-commerce, visual sensors, sentiment analysis, and much more.\n\nThe Entrepreneurial Computer Vision Challenge provides contestants the opportunity to showcase the technology piece of a potential startup company without requiring a full business plan. It provides a unique opportunity for students, engineers, researchers, professors and/or hackers to test the waters of entrepreneurism in front of a panel of judges including top industry venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, journalists, media executives and companies recruiting.\n\nIn the 2014 and 2015 Summits the ECVC was organized into predefined challenge areas (e.g., \u201cestimate the price of a home or property,\u201d \u201cestimate how often a photo will be re-shared\u201d) plus a \u201cwildcard\u201d category.\n\nInitially we proceeded in the same way for the 2016 ECVC, but we found that the most exciting entries were overwhelmingly the wildcards, so we decided to go all-in on that category. Attendees at this year\u2019s summit bore witness to the outstanding lineup of finalists, including GrokStyle (visual understanding for interior design) from Cornell, MD.ai(intelligent radiology diagnostics) from Weill Cornell, DeepALE (semantic image segmentation) from Oxford University and Vision+Love (automated kinship prediction) from Carnegie Mellon.\n\nCongratulations to our 2016 LDV Vision Summit Entrepreneurial Computer Vision Challenge Winner: Grokstyle, Sean Bell, CEO & Co-Founder\n\n\u00a9Robert Wright/LDV Vision Summit\n\nWhat is GrokStyle?\n\nGrokStyle, co-founded by Cornell researchers Sean Bell and Kavita Bala, is developing state-of-the-art visual search. Given any photo, we want to tell you what products are in it, and where you can buy them. We want to help customers and retailers connect with designers, by searching for how others have used and combined furniture and decor products. The world is full of beautiful design \u2014 we want to help you find it.\n\nAs a PhD Candidate \u2014 what were your goals for attending our LDV Vision Summit? Did you attain them?\n\nMy goals were to understand the startup space for computer vision, to connect with potential collaborators, find companies interested in building on our technology, and generally get our name out there so we can have a running start. The event definitely far exceeded our expectations and we attained all of our goals.\n\nWhy did you apply to our LDV Vision Summit ECVC competition? Did it meet or beat your expectations and why?\n\nSerge Belongie recommended that we apply, and saw the value that the summit would have for us. We were excited, but certainly did not expect the amount of positive feedback, support, and connections that we made. My pocket is overflowing with business cards, and I\u2019m excited to continue these conversations as we turn our technology into a company.\n\nWhy should other computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence researchers attend next year?\n\nI think that all CV/ML/AI researchers should attend events like the LDV Vision Summit. The talks here are interesting and varied, and it is inspiring to see how algorithms and computer vision research are having a real impact in the world. You don\u2019t get that at academic conferences like CVPR.\n\nWe try to have an exciting cross section of judges from computer vision experts, entrepreneurs, investors and journalists. Asking a question is Barin Nahvi Rovzar, Hearst, Exec. Dir., R&D & Strategy. Judges included: Serge Belongie (Prof., Cornell Tech, Computer Vision), Howard Morgan (First Round, Partner & Co-Founder), Gaile Gordon (Enlighted, Sr. Director, Technology), Jan Erik Solem (Mapillary, CEO), Larry Zitnick (Facebook, AI Research, Research Lead), Ramesh Jain (U. California, Irvine, Prof., Co-Founder Krumbs), Evan Nisselson \u2014 LDV Capital, Partner), Nikhil Rasiwasia (Principal Scientist, Snapdeal), Beth Ferreira (WME Venture Partners, Managing Partner), Stacey Svetlichnaya (Flickr, Software Engineer, Vision & Machine Learning), Adriana Kovashka (U. of Pittsburgh, Assist. Professor Dept. Computer Science) \u00a9Robert Wright/LDV Vision Summit\n\nWhat was the most valuable part of your LDV Vision Summit experience aside from winning the competition?\n\nThe most valuable part of the summit was connecting with three different companies potentially interested in building on our technology, and with four different potential investors/advisors. Last year, a key potential collaborator had presented at LDV Vision Summit, looking for computer vision researchers to solve challenging problems in visual search, interior design, and recognition. This year we were able to connect and say \u201cwe solved it!\u201d\n\nSean Bell, CEO & Co-Founder of Grokstyle \u00a9Robert Wright/LDV Vision Summit\n\nDo you have any advice for other researchers & PhD candidates that are thinking about evolving their research into a startup business?\n\nMy advice would be to keep potential commercial applications in mind, early on in the project, so that what you end up with at the end is easier to take out of the lab and sell to the world. For me, one of the most challenging aspects of research is deciding which problems are solvable and which are worth solving \u2014 if you are interested in startups, this is even more important. There is the extra step of understanding who cares and who wants to use it.\n\nWhat was the timeline for you to take your idea for your research to evolving it into a startup plan?\n\nWe presented a research paper at SIGGRAPH 2015 about our ideas from last year. It has taken us a year to flesh out the work, develop it from a research prototype to a product prototype. But there is still a lot to do. I am graduating in a few months, and Prof. Kavita Bala is joining full time on sabbatical. We plan to hit the ground running this summer with our engineer Kathleen Tuite, and two interns we are taking on. As technologists, we are looking to partner with business people to take the lead on evaluating which markets and customers can benefit the most from our technology. Starting in the fall, we plan on fundraising to help scale up our technical infrastructure.",

        "title": "Microservices vs. Web Services Part 2",
        "text": "Continued\n\nBefore the era of web services and microservices, software engineers have always been in the pursuit to build perfect information systems and automated solutions. Trailing on old technologies have inspired new ones by adapting and improving on existing systems.\n\nEver wonder why web services and microservices rival? Software engineers have always been in the pursuit to build perfect information systems and automated solutions.\n\nStructure\n\nMicroservices is an architectural style built usually for business capabilities. At the same time, it can be integrated into a web service. Nevertheless, microservices can be a stand-alone service or a function that has its own database and can be implemented and deployed independently of other services.\n\nWeb services is a service provided from one application to another through the World Wide Web. As an API representation through HTTP, it is an abstraction layer that separates between a platform and the specific programming details of how the application code is really called to function.\n\nSize\n\nWeb services mostly include a lot of business functions. They are usually implemented as complete subsystems making the whole system larger.\n\nOn the contrary, \u201cmicro\u201d services, as the name implies, refers to smaller internal components with limited functionality. The implication is that they are more compact than web services.\n\nBounded Context\n\nWeb services allow the sharing of components while microservices are limited in sharing by bounded context. A bounded context is simply the joining of a component and its data as a single unit with low dependency.\n\nSince web services depend on multiple services to carry out a business request, a system built on web services has a tendency to be slower than microservices.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThrough its messaging middleware component, web services enhance the use of several heterogeneous protocols. Microservices differs by reducing the number of choices for integration by having a simple architectural pattern.\n\nPros and Cons of Microservices and Web Services\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of web services and microservices? Let us take a look at some critical factors for judgment such as fail-safety and customization.\n\nFail-Safety\n\nBoth web services and microservices solutions promote fail-safety management in business applications without any form of downtime in performance. They are the best replacements for monolithic app structure as they function separately, yet with an interconnected set of components.\n\nEvery microservice or web service connects to a separate data source. The simultaneous use of an application\u2019s multiple features means that its structure can execute several user requests. This can lead to an app crashing if there is heavy traffic of active users.\n\nA request may be handled by a single microservice or a handful of collaborating microservices. Moreover, since each microservice has its own database, the load of the system can be evenly distributed across different databases. Although web services provide a neutral point of balance between scaling accessibility and fail-safety level microservices scale much better.\n\nCustomization\n\nCustomization of the initial monolithic software structure is also a factor even if you decide to decentralize it. There is always a challenge with some components that can be made into microservices. These components will not work independently inside an existing functionality. It is better to reprogram them from scratch. This is why such components provided as web services is a complex but better solution.\n\nTo be Microservices or not to be Web Services\n\nWhich is the best for my project you may finally ask yourself? Here goes the analysis to show which of the API representation tools are of the best in different situations.\n\nRequirements will always be the primary determiner in choosing the ideal architecture for any type of project. It is not professional to outrightly say that one architecture is superior to the other. The main reason for a choice should be the purpose of the application in question.\n\nSmall desktop and mobile applications don\u2019t use microservices architecture or web services because there is no need for a network connection. In situations like this, software development is less demanding to make and can be produced in a short time frame.\n\nFor more complex software projects, with the need for communication over a network, web service is a good professional choice. It works well for bigger and complex enterprise application environments due to the integration with several other applications.\n\nMicroservices, are best for smaller and well-partitioned, web-based systems. Additionally, if you are a developer working on a mobile or web application, then it is better to use microservices as it gives better control.\n\nHaven considered all the facts we have discoursed, we can conclude that both, microservices and web services, serve different uses and are therefore different types of architectures. In a more practical sense, a software solution can actually function with the combinational use of microservices and web services simultaneously.\n\nFinally, the development process for a critical project must be with some scrutiny. The choice of the best architecture for your software project is a top priority from the go. It is an important decision that determines if the project will be a success, how much time it will take, the validity of testing, and the release of a well-robust product.\n\nAre you a new business startup, an established business owner, or a product manager? Do you want to create, tweak, or manage an app? iTwis is willing to see you through this process. Our well-skilled and experienced mobile development team can successfully facilitate your app production process from scratch and bring it to a significant product release.

        "title": "Write, I Must \u2014 And So Must You!",
        "text": "Write, I Must \u2014 And So Must You!\n\nA new publication incorporating solid foundations and modern fun\n\nDesign by the author\n\nI\u2019ve been writing professionally for 30 years \u2014 back when guidelines were requested by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope and waiting a few weeks. To say the process of publishing has changed some would be a massive understatement. It\u2019s been rebuilt to take advantage of current technologies.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve seen Medium writers come and go. I\u2019ve watched publications grow from the ground up, and I\u2019ve wondered how some ever survived. But one thing has never changed: the writing world is ever-growing. Advances in technology have made it super affordable and possible for all types of people to enter the game, even if only for themselves.\n\nWrite, I Must is a publication for all types of writers. The goal is not to replace Medium\u2019s best writing pubs. Rather, it\u2019s to embrace what we can learn from old-school writers, editors, and publishers, and mix it up with modern tech and lots of fun. Aside from actionable tips and compelling stories, Write, I Must will feature weekly challenges and writer spotlights. And while we\u2019ll do our best to be nicey-nice about things, some of the challenges and voting sessions will be raw and public. Because who really learns from their moms reviewing their work?\n\nPublication features\n\nThere will likely be some adjustments as we grow, but here are some of the key focuses of this publication.\n\nForget the time caps\n\nWrite, I Must is more about actionable content and compelling information than certain read lengths. We\u2019re about taking as much space as necessary to provide valuable insight. Sometimes this takes just a few hundred words; sometimes, it results in a 15-minute read.\n\nTake the challenge\n\nWeekly challenges are designed to provide writers education and inspiration. Some will be difficult; some will be fun. Hopefully, you\u2019ll see them all as a little of both.\n\nRemember (or learn about) when\n\nNewer writers missed out on some amazing products and practices of yesteryear. We\u2019ll shine the spotlight on awesome memories of longtime writers.",

        "title": "Entrepreneurship Is Stressful. Here\u2019s How to Deal With It.",
        "text": "People tend to think of fast cars, luxury vacations, and designer clothes when they hear the word \u201centrepreneur\u201d, but for many, this is far from the reality. The life of an entrepreneur is filled with hard work, long hours, and stress \u2014 the sacrifices they make to achieve their goals.\n\nStress management is an essential skill for entrepreneurs.\n\nWhy?\n\nRunning a business is tough, and you\u2019re bound to run into some issues on your journey.\n\nPerhaps some of your orders are delivered late and you need to deal with upset customers. Maybe you\u2019re struggling to find new products to sell in your online store. Whatever the issues are, it\u2019s important that you understand how to manage stress so you can continue moving forward with your business.\n\nI\u2019m here to help you succeed as an entrepreneur, so I\u2019ve created this article to provide you with my personal stress management tips. At the end of this article, you\u2019ll be armed with the information you need to turn your stress into positive energy.\n\nFirst of all, what is stress?\n\nStress is a natural response from your body when things start to get tough.\n\nStress is that frustration that you feel after an especially hard day at work. It\u2019s the anxiety that you feel if you\u2019re worried about your job security. It\u2019s that sinking feeling that you get if you\u2019ve taken too much work on.\n\nBut, it can also be the cause of that extra burst of energy that you get when you really need to perform.\n\nStress can come in different forms, and it\u2019s essential that you understand how your body reacts to stress. Once you gain an understanding of how your body handles stress, you can take the necessary steps to build a stress management routine that works for you.\n\nThe Benefits of Managing Your Stress\n\nStress management is essential for the longevity of your career, no matter the industry you\u2019re involved in. We all face issues and pressures, but when you\u2019re building a long-term career for yourself, you need to think and act for the long-term too \u2014 that includes looking after yourself. There will always be bumps in the road, but effective stress management will help you to overcome them, and power through at full-speed.\n\nHow to Manage Stress\n\nRemember, there isn\u2019t an exact science to this list \u2014 it\u2019s important that you find what works best for you, as everybody is different. Try out as many or as little of the stress management tips from this list and try to settle on a routine that works for you.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get started.\n\n1. Break Down the Problem\n\nFirst things first, try to break down the problem that is actually causing you stress.\n\nYou might already know, but take some time and think about what it is exactly that\u2019s making you feel stressed. Grab a pen and paper (or your laptop) and just start writing.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the tight deadline that you\u2019ve got coming up, or perhaps you\u2019re struggling to land your first sale with your new business. Whatever it is, try to break it down. Be critical with yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re facing a task which looks impossible at first, I guarantee it\u2019ll look much more manageable if you break it down, and face the task in smaller segments.\n\nStart off by noting down the first thing that you need to tackle your issue, and think about how you\u2019ll achieve success. Once you\u2019ve got that down, move onto the next task you\u2019ll need to complete, and so on. Soon you\u2019ll have a list of micro-tasks that you\u2019ll need to tackle, and you\u2019ve already listed down a clear path to success.\n\nI guarantee that you\u2019ll be spurred on to succeed when the problem seems smaller, and easier to manage.\n\n2. Yoga for Stress Management\n\nYoga is one of the oldest stress management techniques in the world, and for a good reason too. Yoga provides many different health benefits to those who regularly hit the mat.\n\nReduced stress levels, lower blood pressure, lower heart rate, and reduced anxiety are but a few of the benefits that you\u2019ll receive if you adopt a regular yoga practise.\n\nYoga might seem daunting, especially if you\u2019ve never done it before, but you can always join a beginner\u2019s class, or try out a tutorial on YouTube.\n\n3. Take a Break\n\nIf you\u2019re starting off your day with a huge list of tasks that you need to complete, your natural reaction might be to try and power through and complete them as quickly as possible.\n\nThis might work for some, but others might become flustered and fatigued. And if you\u2019re fatigued it\u2019s likely that you won\u2019t be performing at your peak.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to take a break \u2014 it\u2019s actually an effective stress management technique.\n\nAnd don\u2019t rush your break either, take as long as you need before you feel ready to continue tackling your tasks.\n\nIt might seem counterproductive at first \u2014 especially if you have other plans later on in the day \u2014 but taking the time for a break can actually help you to clear your mind, and finish your tasks even faster.\n\n4. Exercise Regularly\n\nExercise is truly one of the best stress management tactics.\n\nYou\u2019ve undoubtedly heard how important it is for your overall health to make sure that you get some exercise multiple times every week, and this sentiment remains true when it comes to managing stress.\n\nIf you want to use exercise as a way to manage your stress levels, make sure that you stay consistent. If you\u2019re hitting the gym, set aside specific evenings (or mornings) of the week which you\u2019ll dedicate to your workouts.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to engage with team sports do some research and enquire into local sports clubs \u2014 they\u2019ll likely have multiple practice sessions every week which you can fit into your schedule.\n\nMy best advice is to pick something that you like doing \u2014 you\u2019ll find much more success if you\u2019re going into your workout excited, rather than dreading it.\n\n5. Watch Your Diet\n\nTo help manage your stress, your diet is always a good starting point.\n\nYour diet is so important for your overall health, but it\u2019s one of the things that the majority of us let slip when we\u2019re under stress. After all, there are so many fast food and delivery options around nowadays which make junk food the easier option, instead of a healthy, balanced diet.\n\nBut, you\u2019re going to need a lot of energy if you want to tackle your daily tasks, and you\u2019ll feel much more energized after eating healthy food.\n\nTreat your body like a sports car \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t put cheap fuel in a Ferrari, so why would you put cheap, unhealthy food in your body?\n\n6. Spend Time Socializing\n\nWhen it comes to stress management, socializing can be so effective.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there: your friend has asked you to come and grab a drink after work, but you turn them down because you\u2019re too tired, or you need to work on your business after work.\n\nAll of those excuses are valid, but when it comes to stress management, socializing can benefit some much more than an early night.\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of person who feels energized after hanging out with some friends, try to do it more often \u2014 it can help you to wind down and come back to work feeling refreshed.\n\n7. Try Out Meditation\n\nMany entrepreneurs have already experienced the benefits that meditation can bring to those who are looking for stress relief. Research suggests that meditation helps to lower your stress levels, helps to aid anxiety and depression, and decreases your blood pressure.\n\nMeditation is a great stress management technique that you can easily incorporate into your daily routine. It doesn\u2019t matter if you choose to meditate in the morning before you tackle your daily tasks, or in the evening after a hard day\u2019s work.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to try meditation, I\u2019d suggest using Headspace. There are plenty of guided sessions on the app that\u2019ll help you test out this stress management technique.\n\n8. Get an Early Night\n\nIf you\u2019re stressed because of your workload you could be tempted to work late into the evening hours to complete your tasks.\n\nYes, this shows your dedication to your craft, and will probably help you to achieve your short-term goals, but you\u2019re building for the long-term, and it\u2019s important that you look after yourself.\n\nSleep is essential for recovery, so try to get an early night most days of the week. If you get enough sleep it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll be energized for the next day.\n\nAlso, try to ensure that you have high-quality sleep too \u2014 switch off all the devices in your bedroom which emit light, and wake up on the first alarm. No snoozing!\n\n9. Learn to Say \u201cNo\u201d\n\nMy final stress management tip is a simple one, but you\u2019d be surprised how effective it can be.\n\nSimply put, learn to say \u201cno\u201d more often.\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of person who loves to help others out, you can fall into the trap of putting others before yourself. And this won\u2019t help you to manage your stress levels.\n\nWhen you\u2019re under stress, put yourself first. Politely decline if somebody asks you for help \u2014 they\u2019ll understand completely, and you\u2019ll feel relieved that you haven\u2019t taken more work on.\n\nThen you\u2019ll be able to use that extra time to finish your tasks early, rest, cook yourself a nice meal, or anything else that helps you to wind down.\n\nAnd remember, stress isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\nTry to think of stress as energy. It\u2019s energy that when harnessed properly, can be used to propel your business towards success.\n\nThis story was originally published on the Oberlo Blog on October 13, 2018.",

        "title": "Considering Writing a Book? Answer These 6 Questions First",
        "text": "Extra tips and tricks\n\nIf you\u2019ve decided that a book is something you want to write after answering these questions, then here are some extra things that may help you, which I use and have found to be very helpful.\n\nJournaling\n\nMore writing! Yes, but for an excellent reason. Journaling helps you identify anything that is preventing you from achieving your book writing goals. Keep a record of how you feel and what is currently going on in your life, ideally daily. Reading back over your journal at the end of each week or month will help you pinpoint anything you didn\u2019t realize was a problem, but actually is.\n\nI identified that by leaving my novel writing until late in the day; I was then more likely to want to watch TV rather than write. In my head, this only amounted to a few incidents, but my journal told me it actually happened 2\u20133 times per week. As a result, I switched to writing in the morning instead and found this worked much better. My journal showed that over the course of the next month I had missed no writing days at all; a massive improvement on the previous month.\n\nOverachieving\n\nThis sounds like a positive rather than a negative; writing more than you have planned to. However, what I found was that I then gave myself a day off from writing the next day because I was ahead of target. This, unfortunately, led to me having several more days off and then I fell behind schedule. Now, when I have a productive day, I think about how I\u2019ve brought my end goal closer, and make sure I use that momentum to continue being productive.\n\nRewards\n\nWriting a book is tough and time-consuming. I\u2019ve found that small rewards help keep me motivated when I reach a goal of every 10,000 words. Treating myself to a fancy hot chocolate and a slice of cake in my favorite cafe or buying (more expensive than I would normally buy) bath salts gives me the little boost to keep going.\n\nSet yourself small goals and reward yourself with something when you hit them. Alternatively, if you think you\u2019ll be more productive by having a bigger reward in mind when you complete the whole book, then do that instead. Whatever works for you.",

        "title": "Your Unabridged Guide to Making a Passive Income on Medium",
        "text": "In a lot of ways, discovering Medium can be like walking onto a red carpet. (At least, this is what I imagine it must be like.) You\u2019re dazzled, overwhelmed, excited, and ready to vomit all at once.\n\nFinally, you have an outlet for your writing, one that pays you! And, look at that \u2014 tons of people have made Medium into their full-time jobs! How incredible would that be?!\n\nAnd then you start to come up with all of these dream scenarios; you\u2019re filled with idealized hope that is exacerbated by the previously mentioned success stories. You become intoxicated by the possibilities. Perhaps tangentially related, you may start thinking rashly and make decisions you come to second guess later on.\n\nHow do I know?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did when I started on this site in February 2019. I learned about Medium through a podcast and I did some research. (Not nearly enough, mind you.)\n\nAs I detailed above, I allowed the idea of \u2018making it big\u2019 wash over me like a tsunami, but I wasn\u2019t at all prepared for the destruction that would follow. (Perhaps the use of the word \u2018destruction\u2019 is a bit melodramatic, I still had a roof over my head and food to eat, but things have been tight for me financially for the last year or so.)\n\nAnyway, within a few days of learning about Medium, I made the impulsive choice to quit my part-time retail job and throw myself into the site wholeheartedly.\n\nNot because I felt financially comfortable enough to do so; but because I wanted out of that place and I saw a chance to make that happen. That job made me miserable, but when I look back, I wish I\u2019d stuck it out just a little bit longer.\n\nI can\u2019t go back and smack my former self upside the head, so I\u2019ll take the lessons I\u2019ve learned and keep them in my pocket for the future. Hopefully, they help you as well.",

        "title": "Is the \u201cGreatest Sales Deck\u201d Great for Savvy Prospects?",
        "text": "In this series, I answer questions about crafting strategic narratives for sales, marketing, fundraising, product, and recruiting. To ask a question, respond to this article or email me: andyraskin@gmail.com.\n\nA few days ago, I received this email from Stephen, an enterprise salesperson at a New York City-based software company:\n\nDear Andy, I recently read your post The Greatest Sales Deck I\u2019ve Ever Seen, about Zuora\u2019s strategic story. Following your advice, I built a pitch very similar to Zuora\u2019s for enterprise companies. However, on more than one occasion I\u2019ve been cut off midway through. Prospects say they know all about the trends/sector, and they ask if I could please switch instead to something \u201cless general.\u201d That makes me wonder: Is the Zuora style OK for general, top-of-funnel sales, but less appropriate for prospects who are more knowledgeable \u2014 those that understand a bit about the space and what your company does, but want to understand your unique offering? \u2014Stephen D., enterprise account executive, New York, NY\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read the post Stephen\u2019s referring to, you can find it here:\n\nWith upwards of 1 million views, \u201cThe Greatest Sales Deck\u201d inspired a lot of people, like Stephen, to re-craft their decks in Zuora\u2019s image. If you\u2019ve read the post (or others I\u2019ve written), you know that I advocate taking time to lay out, as Zuora does, what\u2019s at stake for prospects before introducing your product or the problem it solves.\n\nAnd more than a few of those who followed my advice have reported that their prospects, like Stephen\u2019s, get impatient during that setup. Likewise, some have questioned whether it makes sense to spend all that time setting context for audiences who are already very knowledgable.\n\nBut that question betrays an assumption that I\u2019d like to challenge: that the goal of setting context is education.\n\nIn my experience, you\u2019ll be most successful if your primary goal in setting context is not educating prospects, but engaging them emotionally. Last I checked, savvy, knowledgable people have emotions too, so let\u2019s talk about what else might be going on for Stephen and others.\n\n3 Lessons from Stephen\u2019s Attempt at a \u201cZuora-style\u201d deck\n\nStephen graciously sent me his deck so I could take a look. He asked that I not present his slides or divulge identifying details, and I\u2019ll honor that request. Instead, I\u2019ll share my general feedback to him in the hope that it will be useful to others.\n\n#1. Treat \u201cThe Greatest Sales Deck\u201d as a framework, not a template.\n\nThere are plenty of books about how to write great screenplays, yet plenty of unwatchable movies that follow their advice. What dooms these films? Tons of things, of course, but a biggie is lack of originality.\n\nMany slides in Stephen\u2019s deck were essentially the Zuora ones\u2014different images but identical headlines, with a few of the words changed. The resulting flow may have worked for Zuora\u2019s story, but with Stephen\u2019s it lacked energy. No surprise that prospects wanted him to get on with it.\n\nTo boost the odds that your story connects, harvest language about what\u2019s at stake directly from customers and prospects. Literally ask them, \u201cWhat changes in your world are creating opportunity and risk?\u201d and write down their answers. Then, tailor your pitch\u2019s flow \u2014 whether you present it with slides, whiteboard sketches, or just speaking over coffee\u2014to work for that story.\n\n#2. Convey what\u2019s at stake in 5\u20138 slides (and through other channels!)\n\nI hesitate to give advice about how many slides to use, since I\u2019ve seen company and product stories told equally well with very few slides (or none) and with more than 20.\n\nThat said, when I look back on the strategic narratives I\u2019ve built with leadership teams, and how those have translated into sales decks, they almost always get to the product in eight slides, max. Frequently it\u2019s fewer.\n\nStephen\u2019s deck, on the other hand, required prospects to sit through 12 slides before he introduced his product. That\u2019s almost always too many.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, by the way, that it\u2019s a tall order for your sales pitch alone to convey what\u2019s at stake. In my work with teams, the goal is making sure that everyone\u2014CEO, marketing team, product managers, recruiters, etc.\u2014 is telling the same story, conveying those same stakes.\n\nFor example, I love how 90% of Zuora\u2019s content marketing is not about how great Zuora is, and not about some new Zuora feature announcement. In fact, it\u2019s not about Zuora at all. As you can see from this recent snapshot of Zuora\u2019s blog headlines, it\u2019s about what\u2019s at stake for prospects\u2014and how to win\u2014in a world of subscription business models:\n\nZuora\u2019s blog\u2014not about Zuora, but about what\u2019s at stake for customers.\n\n#3. Don\u2019t just \u201cadd storytelling\u201d\n\nEvery once in a while, I encounter the notion that you can take a pitch that isn\u2019t working, sprinkle in some \u201cstorytelling,\u201d and voil\u00e0!\n\nI sensed that was Stephen\u2019s approach, so I emailed him to ask. Sure enough:\n\n[Yes, I] bolted the Zuora setup to the meat of our [old] deck.\n\nHow did I know? Because when Stephen\u2019s deck eventually did get to his product, the feature discussion was largely detached from the stakes he attempted to lay out in the story\u2019s setup.\n\nIn Stephen\u2019s question, he asked about pitching to people who \u201cunderstand a bit about the space\u2026but want to understand the unique offering.\u201d These are people who are looking to understand your differentiation. The best way to communicate that is not feature comparisons but to first establish a differentiated, happily-ever-after Promised Land. Then you talk about features, but solely in context of how they help prospects overcome obstacles to that Promised Land.\n\nIn other words, to really work, the whole thing has to tie together as a cohesive story, not just the beginning.\n\nKnowledgable people, too, respond to well-crafted strategic stories\n\nIn the face of a prospect\u2019s impatience, it\u2019s understandable if your first instinct is to get rid of the \u201cstory stuff.\u201d And if you don\u2019t have the time or resources to structure a compelling story, your wisest course of action might be to just \u201cshow your wares.\u201d\n\nThat said, it\u2019s likely that your story\u2014like any story when it first sees the light of day\u2014will better engage audiences after a rewrite (or two). In my experience, when you ask prospects and customers what\u2019s at stake for them, and you repeat it back through an efficient, well-honed setup, you get the opposite of impatience: you get nods of recognition, and you get invaluable conversations about how those stakes are playing out for the person/company you\u2019re pitching\u2014regardless of your audience\u2019s level of sophistication.\n\nIf anything, the savvier the prospect, the more they\u2019ll want to engage in a discussion of stakes, as long as you\u2019ve conveyed them credibly. (For more on how to do that, check out How Great Sales Narratives Drive Urgency.)\n\nIn short, a strategic story, well told, builds trust. And that\u2019s worth striving for, no matter whom you\u2019re pitching.",

        "title": "How to Get More out of Your Conversations",
        "text": "Check for intent and attitude\n\nPhoto by Marcos Paulo Prado on Unsplash\n\nMy problem is that I talk a lot and I love connecting and reconnecting with people. I am also guilty of indulging myself in long, meandering phone conversations. So much so that I have considered creating an auto cut phone app like a pre-set timer to keep me in check.\n\nRealizing, that I get easily drawn into conversations at home, one day I went to a local coffee shop to get some work done. I wanted to avoid distractions by being amid strangers.\n\nAt the coffee shop, I needed the wifi password and I figured the quickest way would be to just ask the guy sitting close by.\n\nI ended up talking to this stranger for over an hour!\n\nWhat was I seeking by talking to him for so long and not focusing on my work at hand? I justified the conversation by reminding myself that I enjoyed listening to his motivations for his non-profit. I found his goals intriguing and inspiring at the same time. As our conversation neared the end I had a sinking bittersweet feeling as I tried to justify the time I had spent. My original intent of focusing on my work was in shambles once again, but surely I had gained a lot.\n\nEven after leaving the comfort of my home, I still found myself in the same quandary of getting distracted. I then realized it was not the surroundings but how I engaged in conversations that hampered my work.\n\nAs I tried to be more introspective about improving my conversations, two factors stood out to me: Intent and Attitude.\n\nImage by author\n\nTake a minute to reflect on any interesting talk you remember having. Did you have a clear goal in mind or did you just go with the flow?\n\nImage by author\n\nThe second choice may seem devilish at first glance. Is this akin to having an agenda or at a more sinister level a hidden agenda, every time we open our mouths? Are we robots? Pre-programmed?\n\nIs it so wrong to monitor a conversation to see if is serving its intended purpose? For example, if the end goal is to help the other person would it be wrong to monitor the talk to see if we are serving the purpose we intended?\n\nWhat about just fun? Why can\u2019t conversations be simply for fun? Of course, they can be, and just being aware of that end goal may make them more satisfying.\n\nUsually, there are a few clear goals for engaging. Yes, there may be overlapping intentions but even then, if you dig deeper, there is probably an overriding intention.\n\nOne is to listen to viewpoints that are different from our own. Another is to brainstorm solutions, evaluate them, and make decisions. A third is to connect with others \u2014 be ourselves, relax, entertain, and have fun sharing our thoughts for the sake of sharing. Another reason is to convince others, to influence their thought process and try to get them to follow our viewpoint.\n\nSometimes when self-doubt creeps up, we seek validation of our thoughts from those that we respect, so that we feel better about our stance. We look for people to talk to who will assure us that we are right. These conversations allow us opportunities for loud thinking, where our thoughts can marinate and become clearer. On the surface, the conversation may look like one is trying to convince the other person but actually one is trying to convince oneself.\n\nSome conversations happen out of curiosity, others to make our intentions clear or gain clarity about someone\u2019s intention. Often times, for those of us who think out loud, conversations are the exploratory sandbox that allows us to play with our thoughts.\n\nThe challenge for people like me is to learn how not to filibuster our productivity goals by permanently living in the sandbox but to know when to step out.\n\nMy new self created rule:\n\nThink of your intention, remind yourself that you have control over your thoughts. Before you go into a meeting or pick up the phone and look for someone\u2019s name to call them, think \u2014 why \u2026 what goal \u2014 for how long?\n\nImage by author\n\nWe find some conversations to be more rewarding than others. This is probably due to the attitude of the participants. Next time you get a chance to analyze the quality of a conversation check for some of the following constructs, just for the fun of it. Are you or someone you know responsible for any of the following?\n\nConviction Bias\n\nIs everyone listening with an open mind? Or, is there someone who always assumes that they know more or better? Someone who thinks that they have all the knowledge needed? Someone with an \u201cI know for sure that I am right\u201d attitude?\n\nPower Bias\n\nDoes everyone view the conversation as one among equals? Is one person always telling others what to do? \u201cI am the boss\u201d bias?\n\nAttention Bias\n\nAre all parties listening intently when it is the other party\u2019s turn to talk? Does someone check out as soon as they are done talking?\n\nWinning Bias\n\nIs the conversation a dialogue? Or is someone intent on turning it into a debate so that they can win?\n\nAir Time Bias\n\nIs everyone getting enough time to articulate their thoughts? In a discussion either extreme does not help. If you always sit silently, nod your head, and do not say much then you may not be adding value. And if you want all the time to explain your brilliant ideas, you may be stiffling others.\n\nBeing aware of our conversation style can help us improve it.\n\nI realized that I would often cut people once I thought I knew what they meant, without waiting for them to finish their thought process. And I would have never recognized this except when a good friend pointed it out to me. She helped me immensely\u2026 now I try to be more patient and I make a conscious effort to let others complete their thoughts without interruption.\n\nI learned that one of the highest forms of respect you can pay someone is your undivided attention and your willingness to improve your conversations.",

        "text": "I\u2019m working on a project right now. A big experiment.\n\nI have this theory that writing short pieces \u2014 fiction and non-fiction \u2014 and publishing them on Amazon could lead to a decent income stream. My goal is to make $100 a month within 90 days and $1000 a month within a year.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll do more. Maybe it\u2019ll fail completely. I honestly have no idea. This isn\u2019t the time for me to think about that. Because I have no control, really, over the results.\n\nMy experiment might fail spectacularly. It might take off and be the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nRight now, at this early stage, all I can do is focus on what I can control. That\u2019s my work ethic. Creating content. My willingness to take risks. My persistence. My vision.\n\nThe Perfect Day Exercise\n\nMy very favorite self-help book was written by Barbara Sher. It\u2019s called Wishcraft. I\u2019ve written about it before, and how it really changed my life when I was very young and my marriage was falling down around my ears.\n\nOne of the exercises in Wishcraft that I still do at least once a year, even 25 years later, is something I call The Perfect Day Exercise. Basically, just sit down and right out a perfect day sometime in the future.\n\nJust imagine that you already have everything you want. Where do you live? Who do you live with? What do you do with your time? What kind of work do you do? Go into detail.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, do a little analysis. What are the elements of that perfect day? How do they compare to your current life? You\u2019re trying to identify the gaps, so that you can figure out how to bridge them.\n\nOne of my gaps is blogging. I love writing for Ninja Writers via a blog. I even blogging here on Medium. But my income from that blogging is so unpredictable and the platform is so volatile, that it is difficult to count on.\n\nI\u2019ve also been teaching other people to blog on Medium for almost two years. I can teach all kinds of things \u2014 my students are curated regularly, they have great habits, they know technically how to blog well. But I none of us have any control over the income that comes from it.\n\nTo bridge that gap for myself and for my students, I started thinking about Amazon. It\u2019s much, much bigger with many times more readers visiting it every day. The pool of money that goes to readers is multitudes larger at Amazon than it is at Medium. While Amazon also has some volatility, it\u2019s got more transparency and stability than Medium.\n\nSo \u2014 my experiment. Can something like expanded blogging work for building an income stream? My thought is that short nonfiction works of 5,000 words or so (or fiction under 10,000 words) can be created regularly and published consistently.\n\nStarting next week I\u2019ll be publishing one non-fiction piece and one fiction piece on Amazon every week. My goal is to keep it up for a year. There are parts of this project I can control and parts I can\u2019t.\n\nThree Layers of Control\n\nControl over your work has three layers. There are things you have absolute control over. There are things you have some control over. And there are things you have no control over at all.\n\nPutting the bulk of your effort into the things you can control, less into what you can sort of control, and leaving what you can\u2019t control alone will help you stick with your plan long enough for it to have a chance to work. And it will give you the best chance for success.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all three layers.\n\nWhat You Can Control\n\nThe number one thing you have control over is your own effort. Your work ethic. You might not have control over anything else in some instances, but you can always show up and do the work.\n\nWhen I think about my Amazon experiment, I have control over whether I actually produce those non-fiction and fiction short pieces. The only thing that can stop me, other than something totally out of my control like illness, is me.\n\nAs long as I\u2019m capable of working, it\u2019s up to me to decide whether or not to do that work.\n\nI can control my efforts to learn, too. That means reading a lot and finding other people who can help me figure out the things I don\u2019t know how to do.\n\nWhat You Can Kind of Control\n\nI can sort of control my ability to pivot. I say sort of, even though, of course \u2014 I can pivot anytime I want to. I have less control, though, over whether a pivot is a good idea.\n\nEven taking on this experiment at all is a thing I can only sort of control, right? Because I have no idea whether or not it will work. And at some point in the next year, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll step back and evaluate and have to decide whether what I\u2019m doing is working or not.\n\nAm I pivoting to try something new too soon? Am I waiting too long? It\u2019s so hard to know, and that can be maddening.\n\nSticking with something too long, just because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve decided to do, can be a big mistake. Switching gears too soon and too often can undermine my efforts. Ugh.\n\nAnother thing I can sort of control is making sure my work keeps improving. Of course, I have total control over my willingness and desire to improve. But I have less control over whether I actually am getting better. I can only try to do my best.\n\nWhat You Can\u2019t Control\n\nI can\u2019t control whether or not people buy, read, or enjoy my work.\n\nThat\u2019s hard. It\u2019s so hard. I want to control it. I want to be a bestseller, damn it. I want everyone to love me and my work and all my stories. But it\u2019s not up to me. Once I put my work out there, either it\u2019s going to hit or it\u2019s not.\n\nAll I can do is go back to the beginning and start all over again with what I can control \u2014 which is the work.\n\nThe Rest Will Take Care of Itself\n\nSo. We can control our work. We can sort of control what we do with it. And we can\u2019t control at all whether or not other people want to read it.\n\nIf we focus on the work and on what we have at least some control over, then I really believe the rest will take care of itself. Eventually. It might take some time. It might take some hard pivots and difficult decisions. It might take longer than I want it to.\n\nBut eventually the rest will take care of itself.",

        "title": "5 Tips to Talk Persuasively About Climate Disruption",
        "text": "5 Tips to Talk Persuasively About Climate Disruption Katrine Follow Dec 15 \u00b7 5 min read\n\nPhoto by Jason Rosewell on Unsplash\n\nSomeone close to me does not believe in human-caused climate disruption.\n\nHe\u2019s a successful businessman and highly rational. How is it possible that he doesn\u2019t believe in the scientific consensus? After all, 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing climate disruption.\n\nPeople develop defence mechanisms to avoid the uncomfortable truths around global warming, explains Per Espen Stoknes. He is a psychologist and economics PhD who focuses on climate psychology, climate economics, and climate policy.\n\nIf your job is in the fossil fuels industry, or you depend on cheap gas (thanks to a long car commute to work, say), it is psychologically much harder to admit that your lifestyle is disrupting the air than if you work in the re-insurance industry (which daily calculates climate risks) or drive an electric car.\n\n\u2014 Stoknes, Per Espen. What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming (p. 107). Chelsea Green Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\nHow can we talk more persuasively about climate disruption to get past people\u2019s mental defence mechanisms?\n\n1. Paint a Picture of a Beautiful Future\n\nI feel disheartened reading about the imminent catastrophes in our news. \u201cStop travelling,\u201d we\u2019re told, and still we are headed for tragedy.\n\nInstead, we need a joint vision to fight for, where we are healthier, breathe fresher air, and enjoy wildlife.\n\nHere\u2019s a beautiful world described by the author Mike Berners-Lee:\n\nThe air is fresher. Life is healthier, longer, more relaxed, more fun and more exciting. Our diets are varied, tasty and healthy. More of us get out as much as we want to, both socially and physically. Travel is easier \u2014 but we spend less time in transit. We feel freer to live life in whatever way seems meaningful to each of us at the time, in negotiation with other people\u2019s equal right to do likewise. There is less violence at every level. Cities are vibrant whilst the countryside teems with wildlife. Our jobs are more interesting, and the pressures are more often self-imposed. We expect, insist on and get higher standards of trust and truth, in politics, in the media and in fact everywhere. We are better connected to the people around us and to our sense of the global community. We give more of our time and attention to others and we notice and enjoy more of what is going on around us. We might compete with each other for fun but where it really matters we collaborate better than ever before. Berners-Lee, Mike. There Is No Planet B (p. 9). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition.\n\nSteal some lines for the next time you are selling people on our better future?\n\n2. Make the Numbers Come to Life With Imagery\n\nClimate terms include the 2-degree target, the 1.5-degree target, CO2 levels in ppm, and other technical words.\n\nJust understanding the terms requires hours of studying. No wonder there are still many climate sceptics and deniers out there.\n\nTo convey how we are burning our globe, we can use imagery.\n\nLook at how Per Espen Stoknes makes the numbers come to life:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s imagine that CO2 is a brown haze heavier than air. All CO2 thus falls down to earth and creates a blanket layer, a pool around us that we are \u2018swimming\u2019 in. How high would this layer be if spread out evenly all around the world? It used to be around fifteen feet before the industrial revolution. But humans have now added around seven extra feet so we\u2019re today immersed in a dense twenty-two-foot-high fog all over the world. Feels a bit more suffocating than \u2018400 ppm,\u2019 doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nStoknes, Per Espen. What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming (p. 70). Chelsea Green Publishing. Kindle Edition.\n\nI\u2019ve tried describing how we are swimming in a \u201cdense twenty-two-foot-high [7 meter] fog\u201d to friends. Trust me \u2014 it works wonders.\n\nPhoto by Raphael Rychetsky on Unsplash\n\n3. Appeal to Our Loss Aversion\n\nWe hate giving up something we already have. If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019ll feel much worse about losing $20 than about winning $20. This concept is known as loss aversion.\n\nHow can we use loss aversion to our advantage?\n\nStoknes suggests that we talk about insurance to avoid higher costs in the future.\n\n\u201cOne way to utilize this framing for climate could be: We must build a climate defense today so we can avoid the climate declaring war on us in the future. Future climate mayhem may release waves of unrest, riots, refugees, and terrorists. Good climate policy is good military strategy \u2014 something the US Department of Defense has emphasized in its own reports.\u201d\n\n\u2014 What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming: Toward a New Psychology of Climate Action by Per Espen Stoknes\n\nInsurance is something most people understand. I\u2019ll certainly try this with my highly rational, business-minded friend.\n\n4. Use Bold Words\n\nThe phrase \u201cclimate change\u201d is bland and plays into the hands of sceptics. After all, does \u201cclimate change\u201d need to be caused by humans? And could \u201cclimate change\u201d even be a good thing?\n\nLet\u2019s look at alternative words.\n\n\u201cClimate cancer\u201d was put forth as an alternative in an engaging 3-minute video by Simon Sinek, the author behind the bestseller book \u201cStart With Why.\u201d\n\nStoknes suggests \u201cclimate disruption\u201d and \u201cglobal burning\u201d as alternatives.\n\nI\u2019ve chosen \u201cclimate disruption\u201d in this article. How does it sound?\n\n5. Communicate Certainty\n\nThe public opinion evolves continuously. We debate and shift the boundaries for what is normal versus what is radical. In climate communication, we need to be explicit about these boundaries.\n\nWe should show that we know that human behaviours cause climate disruption. We can highlight that it\u2019s an outlier opinion to think anything else. After all, 97% of scientists, the United Nations, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and governments across the world state that human activities cause climate disruptions.\n\nSome questions are not up for debate. Just like I won\u2019t engage if someone tries to argue that the Earth is flat.\n\nInstead, we can debate how bad and frequent the following extreme weather, drought, and other disasters will be. Or how we should act. Or our underlying values around national and international solidarity which form the basis for our policy reaction.",

        "title": "This Quiz Will Tell You Exactly What Type of Writer You Are",
        "text": "We are not all the same.\n\nWriters are people, of course. And people come in all varieties. We all have different goals, different interests, different needs. We all have different struggles and different strengths.\n\nWhen I write about writing, I\u2019m trying to create a blog post that will appeal to the broadest audience. I can\u2019t write just to you. I need you to dig a little and find yourself in the advice, so that you can apply it in a helpful way.\n\nThat can be difficult to do, if you struggle with knowing exactly what kind of writer you are.\n\nI\u2019ve Identified Five Writer Archetypes\n\nJust five. Every writer I know falls into one of them \u2014 and then there are intersections. Those five archetypes combine in a wide variety of ways.\n\nHere are the archetypes:\n\nHesitater. Let\u2019s start here. A hesitater is someone who has one foot on the gas and the other on the break. They are learners. They are perfectionists. They want to get everything just right, and that keeps them from getting started. They struggle to get started with a new project, but are excellent students and are open to new ideas. No one is just a Hesitater. When they take their foot off the break, they slip into one of the other archetypes, even though they will always be a Hesitater, too.\n\nSkipper. A Skipper is a writer whose happy place is having an assignment. Skippers often are journalists or work for publications. They can struggle with coming up with ideas for what to write, when they don\u2019t have an assignment and they are usually very good with discipline and finishing what they start. Like Hesitaters, they are never just Skippers. Skippers will always have a strong suit in one of the following three archetypes. They write for the paycheck.\n\nSpiller. A Spiller is a confessional writer. These inward-facing writers excel at storytelling. Their writing often is very cathartic and healing \u2014 for the writer and the reader. They tend to niche easily, writing deeply on the same handful of topics. Spillers sometimes struggle with remembering to invite their readers into their story. They are exceptionally good at being authentic and vulnerable. They write for themselves.\n\nTeacher. A Teacher is a writer who, not surprisingly, writes to teach. This writer is inundated by ideas \u2014 their own and other people\u2019s. They are outward-facing writers who would most likely not do their work if they didn\u2019t have readers. Teachers are great with starts, but struggle to finish. They write for their readers.\n\nArtist. Artists are writers who have a top-level goal of creating beautiful work. They tend to have a single idea at a time and work on it with single-mindedness until it\u2019s complete. They tend to be good with having a smaller number of readers, as long as those readers appreciate their art. Artists struggle with writer\u2019s block more often than other writers, but they are dedicated to learning their craft. They write for their muse.\n\nMost writers have a top-level archetype and a secondary that informs and refines it.\n\nLet\u2019s Figure Out Your Archetype\n\nChoose one answer for each question. Don\u2019t overthink it. (Here\u2019s a printable version of this quiz.)\n\n1. For whom do you write?\n\nA. I\u2019m not sure yet.\n\nB. Whoever pays me.\n\nC. Myself.\n\nD. My readers.\n\nE. My muse.\n\n2. How prolific are you?\n\nA. I write, but no one has ever seen my work. I will share it as soon as I\u2019m ready.\n\nB. Highly. I write as often as my employer requires me to.\n\nC. As prolific as I want to be. I write when I have a story to tell.\n\nD. I tend to write a lot, because I\u2019m excited about my ideas.\n\nE. Not particularly prolific. I often focus on one project for a very long time.\n\n3. How do your ideas show up?\n\nA. As another thing to learn about.\n\nB. They are assigned to me.\n\nC. My ideas come to me as I move through life, they are closely tied to my actual experiences.\n\nD. In a constant barrage, from all sides.\n\nE. One at a time.\n\n4. How important is earning a living as a writer to you?\n\nA. It\u2019s important, but the whole concept is overwhelming.\n\nB. Highly important. (Even the most important thing.)\n\nC. Important. If I could earn a living as a storyteller, that would be so amazing.\n\nD. Important. If I could earn a living connecting with my tribe, that would be so amazing.\n\nE. The last thing on my list of what\u2019s important about being a writer.\n\n5. Why do you write?\n\nA. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to do and I love being immersed in the culture of writers.\n\nB. Because I love creative work.\n\nC. For healing.\n\nD. To teach.\n\nE. For the art of it.\n\n6. Which book do you wish you\u2019d written?\n\nA. The last book I read is almost always my new favorite. I wish I\u2019d written them all!\n\nB. I\u2019d love to ghostwrite a novel for my favorite celebrity.\n\nC. A memoir.\n\nD. Something that is a universal favorite, like The Chronicles of Narnia or a highly-impacting creative non-fiction book.\n\nE. Any National Book Award winner.\n\n7. How much detail do you put into your writing?\n\nA. I haven\u2019t written much yet, but I\u2019m drawn to one of the answers below.\n\nB. As much as is expected by my editor.\n\nC. Tons of detail \u2014 most of it very personal.\n\nD. Some, but I\u2019m more interested in clearly sharing ideas.\n\nE. All of the detail \u2014 this is my happy place.\n\n8. How much of yourself do you put into your writing?\n\nA. I\u2019m not sure yet. I haven\u2019t started writing.\n\nB. None at all.\n\nC. My writing is almost always about myself. It is possible that people who know me are uncomfortable reading my work.\n\nD. I have to remind myself to put myself in my stories. Sometimes people say my writing is too dry or academic.\n\nE. It depends on the story \u2014 sometimes a lot, sometimes none at all \u2014 but my writing is always in my voice. People often say they would know my work anywhere.\n\n9. Which of these is your biggest strength?\n\nA. Research.\n\nB. Switching gears between topics.\n\nC. Storytelling.\n\nD. Sharing ideas.\n\nE. The artistic craft of writing.\n\n10. Which of these is your biggest weakness?\n\nA. Insecurity.\n\nB. My writing is sometimes generic or boring.\n\nC. Audience building.\n\nD. Finishing what I start.\n\nE. Perfectionism.\n\n11. My favorite thing about being a writer is . . .\n\nA. Being part of a writing community.\n\nB. Earning a living doing something I love.\n\nC. Processing my life via my art.\n\nD. Building a tribe around my niche.\n\nE. Creating something beautiful.\n\n12. I feel like I\u2019m successful when . . .\n\nA. I start a project.\n\nB. Someone pays me for my work.\n\nC. People are talking about my story.\n\nD. When someone has learned something from me.\n\nE. My muse and inner editor are both satisfied.\n\nResults\n\nIf your answers are mostly A: You\u2019re probably a Hesitater.\n\nIf your answers are mostly B: You\u2019re probably a Skipper.\n\nIf your answers are mostly C: You\u2019re probably a Spiller.\n\nIf your answers are mostly D: You\u2019re probably a Teacher.\n\nIf your answers are mostly E: You\u2019re probably an Artist.\n\nPay attention to your second most popular answers \u2014 or if there was a second answer you were drawn to on several questions. That is most likely your secondary archetype.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a clear secondary, particularly if most of your answers were A, consider taking the test again, choosing your second-best answer.\n\nNow What?\n\nLean into your archetype. It will help you both be a happier writer and overcome the things that you struggle with. Once you know what kind of writer you are, you can build systems to support you.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Hesitater, know that you\u2019re always going to have to combat your natural tendency to find reasons not to write. Your perfectionism will get in the way. You need a system to help you get over the hump between not-writing and writing. Tiny goals and a writing accountability partner \u2014 another writer who will hold you to your goals \u2014 are a good start.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Skipper, then you can stop feeling guilty for not wanting to do work that you\u2019re not paid for. Lean into your business skills and build a writing career that pays the bills. You need a system to help you find those jobs and treat your work like the business that it is. Self-imposed deadlines will help.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Spiller, then you can stop trying to write listicles and how-to posts. They aren\u2019t your thing. Your authenticity is your shining light. You need a system for remembering to invite your reader into your work. Start by creating an avatar for your ideal reader \u2014 an invented reader that you\u2019re writing for.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Teacher, then you can stop trying to write highly personal essays that don\u2019t feel natural to you. That\u2019s not your strong suit. You are an idea person and sharing those ideas is where you blossom as a writer. You need a system for capturing those ideas and sticking with one long enough to finish it. Try keeping an idea notebook and rewarding yourself for finishing one project by allowing yourself to explore another.\n\nIf you\u2019re an Artist, then you can stop feeling like you have to be anything else. You have goals that go beyond how many copies you sell or readers you have. You are really good at sticking with an interesting idea until it\u2019s finished, with such single-mindedness that it can seem like you\u2019ll never have another one again. You need a system for combating writer\u2019s block. Start with a teeny, tiny goal. Write for ten minutes a day, even when your muse isn\u2019t cooperating.",

        "title": "dataxu\u2019s journey from an Enterprise MPP database to a cloud-native data warehouse, Part 1",
        "text": "This is part 1 of a series of blogs on dataxu\u2019s efforts to build out a cloud-native data warehouse and our learnings in that process.\n\nAt dataxu, we deal with data collection, storage, processing, analysis, and consumption at massive scale. For this reason, we were an early adopter of the Hadoop framework. We quickly discovered that Hadoop and Hive alone were not sufficient for the growing needs of interactive analysis and querying. And so, about five years ago, we incorporated an MPP database as our warehouse solution.\n\nThe on-premise solution served us well as the cluster size expanded 16 fold over the course of five years. However, even with the addition of an MPP, we started to run into significant operational challenges:\n\nWhile it is possible to expand the MPP database, it takes months of planning and execution. The capacity planning is particularly tricky. If the business experienced unexpected growth, it would be difficult to bring additional capacity online in a timely fashion. If the business growth slowed, we could be stuck with an over-sized cluster for a number of months, before the volume eventually caught up.\n\nThe capacity planning is particularly tricky. If the business experienced unexpected growth, it would be difficult to bring additional capacity online in a timely fashion. If the business growth slowed, we could be stuck with an over-sized cluster for a number of months, before the volume eventually caught up. The database requires constant maintenance , both in terms of hardware (like replacing failed disks) and software (like vacuuming catalog). Moreover, the database constantly experienced failed processes, which requires DBA to perform recovery operations.\n\n, both in terms of hardware (like replacing failed disks) and software (like vacuuming catalog). Moreover, the database constantly experienced failed processes, which requires DBA to perform recovery operations. Ad-hoc query users constantly compete with production ETL loads for the fixed capacity, leading to unpredictable load times and SLA misses.\n\nThe MPP solution was clearly not a sustainable option for serving dataxu\u2019s business needs. As such, we started to look for an AWS cloud-native solution. After reviewing several competing solutions, we settled on Apache Spark on EMR as our primary ETL solution and AWS Athena as primary query solution.\n\nIn this blog, we will discuss the comparison of a cloud-native warehouse vs. MPP, with some focus on Spark as an ETL solution.\n\nCloud-native warehouse vs. MPP\n\nFirst and foremost, the primary reason to choose Spark is not for performance. As it currently stands, even if a Spark cluster is configured with an equivalent amount of CPU, RAM, and disk capacity, it is unlikely to beat the query performance of the MPP solution. There are many reasons why an MPP database will \u201cbeat\u201d Apache Spark on paper:\n\nEMR clusters run on VMs, while MPP on-prem runs on highly tuned bare metal servers.\n\nEMR clusters run in VPC, while MPP on-prem has a dedicated network switch and 100Gbit throughput.\n\nEMR clusters use S3 as storage, while MPP on-prem has superior I/O performance with direct attached disks on RAID10.\n\nMPP database has years of query optimization expertise, while Spark has a lot to catch up on.\n\nMPP databases allow for data locality. That means the data can be split into shards by a key \u2014 so each fixed node \u201cowns\u201d a shard. A well chosen distribution key cuts down on so-called broadcasts (data movements over network across the nodes).\n\nReasons for choosing Spark\n\nWhile an MPP may look like the better option on the surface, there are a number of reasons why here at dataxu we chose to implement Spark as our primary ETL solution.\n\nSeparation of Compute and Storage. The Storage tier is S3, with all the durability, infinite scalability, and recoverability built-in. The Compute is EMR with a wide range of possible instance families to match CPU and RAM needs. We also use transient and dedicated EMR clusters for ETL loads, where there is no sharing of workloads. A single cluster is dedicated for only one load, which enables a predictable execution time and guarantees SLA. We never have to worry about having the right balance of storage and compute. We never have to worry about running out of storage or having enough compute. Separation of Metadata and Data. Hive metastore has evolved as the de facto open source standard for managing schema objects, supporting tables, view, partitions, and UDFs. We no longer need to vacuum data catalog which also removes a common locking condition on MPP databases. Dynamic Elasticity. The ability to scale the computing resources to dynamically match the business and technical requirements. In addition, with EMR auto-scaling features, a cluster can be scaled up and down even when active queries are executing and newly provisioned capacity can be put to in-flight query instantly. Reduction of Maintenance. There is no longer a physical database to manage. No more backups, no more disk failures and replacement, and no more shutting down databases for hardware/network maintenance. Resilience and Fault Tolerance. Any tiny issues in MPP will cause a query to fail, while Spark will re-try multiple times. This leads to significantly increased resilience, particularly in the hostile cloud environment. Cost Efficiency. Spot pricing and Instance Fleets yield significant savings over a fixed-cost, on-prem solution. Open Source. As the most active Big Data open source project, the amount of contributions for Spark hugely dwarfs that for any other MPP solutions out there.\n\nElectrical wiring: A visual analogy\n\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, we can compare MPP vs. the cloud-native warehouse to different methods of electrical wiring:\n\nThe left side is a serial circuit with no switches. The capacity is fixed, has to size for peak capacity and is always on. Bringing in a new workload meaning less throughput to all existing workloads, such is the case with an MPP solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the right side is a parallel circuit with switches. The capacity is elastic \u2014 you can use and pay when needed. Bringing on a new workload does not diminish or interfere with any existing workload, such is the case with our cloud-native warehouse.\n\nCloud-native warehouse: Endless possibilities\n\nWith cloud-native warehouse, there is no longer a monolithic database stack. The database is decomposed into\n\nStorage (open file formats on S3). File formats are open, like Parquet or ORC, no longer locked into proprietary formats, support queries via many different platforms and query engines.\n\n(open file formats on S3).

        "title": "Insert Yourself Into Any Picture With C#, Dlib, and OpenCV",
        "text": "Just kidding!\n\nThat\u2019s actually Bradley Cooper front and center. I used a C# \u2018face-swapping\u2019 app to superimpose my face over his, and digitally insert myself into the famous DeGeneres Oscar selfie.\n\nWould you like to learn how I did that?\n\nLet\u2019s find out how to tackle this problem in C#. I am going to use the awesome Accord library which is perfect for creating computer vision apps.\n\nI\u2019ll also use OpenCvSharp3, a C# wrapper for the awesome OpenCV library. I will be using a couple of image transformation functions from this library.\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to be using DLib. In the computer vision world, this is the go-to library for face detection. It\u2019s written entirely in C++ but fortunately there is a wrapper called DlibDotNet that exposes all functionality to C#.\n\nSo the first thing I need is the original selfie:\n\nAnd a nice picture of me where I\u2019m looking roughly in the same direction as Bradley:\n\nThe Dlib library has fantastic support for face detection, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to start working with.\n\nI\u2019ll start by detecting all Landmark Points in Bradley Cooper\u2019s face. Landmark points are predetermined and numbered locations on a face:\n\nThe Dlib face detector is pre-trained to recognize 68 landmark points that cover the jaw, chin, eyebrows, nose, eyes, and lips of a face.\n\nHere\u2019s what it looks like when I detect and plot every landmark point for every celebrity in the picture:\n\nDlib is pretty awesome in that it can track these points in real time. The computational overhead for calculating all these points is only 1ms!\n\nMy code can swap faces with anyone in the picture, but the results look best when I pick Bradley Cooper.\n\nHere\u2019s the C# code to detect all landmark points in Bradley\u2019s face:\n\nI start by instantiating a FrontalFaceDetector and a ShapePredictor. Please note two things about this code:\n\nDetecting faces and detecting landmark points (called a \u2018shape\u2019) are two different things in Dlib, with wildly different performance. Detecting faces is very slow, whereas shape detection only takes ~1ms and can be done in real time.\n\nThe ShapePredictor is actually a machine learning model that loads from a fully-trained data file. You can re-train the shape predictor on anything you like: human faces, cat & dog faces, plants, objects, \u2026\n\nDlib uses a different image format than the NET framework (it\u2019s written in C++, remember?) so I need to convert the selfie before I start. The ToArray2D<> method converts my bitmap to an array of RgbPixel structs which is what Dlib uses.\n\nThen I use Detect() to detect all faces in the image, and just grab the first one which happens to be Bradley Cooper. The result is a rectangle that identifies where Bradley\u2019s face is in the picture.\n\nNext, I call Detect() on the shape predictor and provide the selfie and the face rectangle. The result is a class that has a GetPart() method I can use to retrieve the coordinate of any landmark point.\n\nMy upcoming face swap code relies heavily on OpenCV code which has its own point structs. So my last line is a LINQ expression that converts the Dlib points to OpenCV points.\n\nSeriously, 80% of all computer vision code is just converting points and rectangles from one library format into another \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe next thing I need to do is calculate the Convex Hull of the landmark points. This is just a fancy way of saying I want the outermost points that form a smooth boundary around the face:\n\nOpenCV has a built-in function that can calculate the convex hull for me:\n\nThe ConvesHullIndices() method calculates the indices of all convex hull landmark points, so all I need to do is run another LINQ query to get an enumeration of those points for Bradley Cooper.\n\nHere\u2019s what the convex hull looks like on Bradley\u2019s face:\n\nNext, I need to repeat these steps with my own face:\n\nThis is exactly the same code, but now I\u2019m working on the newImage bitmap instead of image.\n\nAnd here is my hull:\n\nSo at this point I have two convex hulls: one for Bradley\u2019s face and one for my own face.\n\nThe next thing I need to do is calculate the Delaunay Triangles on my face and then Warp them so that they match Bradley\u2019s face exactly.\n\nDelaunay Triangulation is a process that creates a grid of triangles that entirely covers Bradley\u2019s face. Each triangle is made up of three unique landmark points on Bradley\u2019s convex hull.\n\nHere\u2019s what that looks like. The blue lines form the Delaunay triangles:\n\nNext, I\u2019ll Warp each triangle from my face to Bradley\u2019s face. A warp is a linear transformation that distorts the triangle so that its three corners fit the new face exactly.\n\nIn the following diagram, a Delaunay triangle made up of landmark points 3, 14, and 24 on my face is warped so that it fits exactly on Bradley\u2019s face and the three corners precisely match Bradley\u2019s landmark points 3, 14, and 24:\n\nThe really nice thing about this process is that each triangle warp is a linear transformation. The pixels inside each triangle can be moved with a super-fast linear matrix operation.\n\nThere\u2019s no linear relationship between the coordinates of my convex hull points and Bradley\u2019s. If we tried to move all pixels directly, we would have to use a slow nonlinear transform. But by first covering Bradley\u2019s face in Delaunay triangles and then warping each triangle separately, the whole operation becomes linear (and fast!).\n\nHere\u2019s how you can perform Delaunay Triangulation and Warping in C#:\n\nI\u2019m using a handy Utility class with a GetDelaunayTriangles method to calculate the triangles on Bradley\u2019s face, a GetWarps method to calculate the warp for each triangle, and an ApplyWarps method to apply the warps to my face to make it match Bradley\u2019s convex hull.\n\nThe warpedImg variable now holds my face, sufficiently distorted to match Bradley\u2019s convex hull:\n\nThere\u2019s one more thing I need to do. The tone of my skin is different from Bradley\u2019s. So if I simply plonk my image on top of his in the selfie, we\u2019re going to see a jarring color change at the edge of my image:\n\nTo fix that, I\u2019m going to use a very nice OpenCV function that can seamlessly blend one image into another and smooth out any color differences, called SeamlessClone.\n\nHere\u2019s how you do a seamless clone in C#:\n\nThe SeamlessClone method needs two things to do its magic:\n\nA mask to tell it which pixels to blend. I calculate the mask by taking Bradley\u2019s convex hull and filling it with white pixels using the FillConvexPoly method.\n\nmethod. A center point where the color should be 100% my skin tone. Pixels further away from this point will get more and more of Bradley\u2019s skin tone. I estimate the center of Bradley\u2019s face by calling BoundingRect to get a bounding box around his face, and then taking the center of this box.\n\nThen I call SeamlessClone to perform the clone and store the result in the blend variable.\n\nHere\u2019s what the final result looks like:\n\nYou might be wondering why I need the convex hull in this process. Why not use all of the landmark points for calculating the triangles?\n\nThe reason is actually very simple. Compare my face with Bradley. Notice how he is smiling and I am not?\n\nIf I use all landmark points, the app will try to deform my entire face to match Bradley\u2019s lips, nose, and eyes. It will spread my lips apart in an attempt to make me smile and show my teeth.\n\nThe results are not pretty \ud83d\ude05\n\nBy only using the convex hull points, the app can distort my jawline to match Bradley\u2019s, but it can\u2019t touch my eyes, nose, and mouth. That means my expression stays the same in the new image and that looks a lot better.\n\nAs a final step, I\u2019ll apply an Instagram filter to smooth out the color difference even more:\n\nAnd there you have it: irrefutable proof that Ellen and I are BFFs!\n\nYou can grab the complete source code from here: https://github.com/mdfarragher/ComputerVision_Bootcamp/tree/master/bootcamp_faceswap\n\nSo what do you think? Have I inspired you to write computer vision code of your own?",

        "title": "Recovery is a Commitment to Awareness",
        "text": "Photo by Mink Mingle on Unsplash\n\nTo understand my commitment to awareness I have to start with all the time spent avoiding feeling. Like someone who\u2019d grown up in a dark room not knowing what colors are, that\u2019s how I was about my own feelings. Cut off from the neck down. Understanding feelings in theory, but never fully allowing myself to feel them.\n\nThis blindness began long before my addiction took hold, it goes back to my early childhood. I was a sensitive child not allowed to feel. Sensitive people, (which I\u2019m starting to believe is all of us) have it hard in this broken world. Crying, in my house, was seen as a nuisance. \u201cStop crying or I\u2019ll give you something to cry about\u201d I would hear, when I was looking for comfort. I internalized that advice, and turned against my pain.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I started this journey towards awareness that I realized how cut-off I had become from my grief.\n\nI learned early that my emotional needs might not be met \u2014 either by an emotionally absent father, or a resentful and exhausted mother. Nor by a brother who in learning to navigate his own sensitivity would eventually shut me out of his young life. Or another brother who would leave when I was still a child. As the youngest, my voice wasn\u2019t heard.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t heard by my community. A small southern town, disowning of anything different or strange. It was no place for a queer young woman, struggling to figure out where her creative and sensitive soul could softly land. I remember a lot of rejection, of people just wishing I would conform, and when I didn\u2019t \u2014 shutting me out. After graduating high school early, I vowed to leave and never come back.\n\nSo what did I learn? I learned to armor up. I learned that feelings were dangerous. I learned that vulnerability led to pain. And I learned to drink.\n\nInstead of opening up to what was in me, and longing to come out, I stuffed it. I denied it for long enough, that I forgot. My identity changed. I became the girl who didn\u2019t need anyone. The cold one. The one who could drop people and never look back. I was indestructible. I rejected people before they had a chance to reject me.\n\nWhen you\u2019re armored, no one can get in. Even the ones that are good. Even the people you want to let in. When you\u2019re in hiding, you\u2019re safe, but you\u2019re all alone.\n\nJohann Hari says that \u201cthe opposite of addiction is connection.\u201d When I first heard that a few years ago, it made perfect sense to me. I remember the first time I got drunk and the falling away of that armor. I felt lighter. I wasn\u2019t worried about saying or doing the wrong thing. It was such a relief. I distinctly remember a voice deep within me saying \u201cI need this.\u201d\n\nI did need that freedom, the voice was right. But I didn\u2019t need a drug to get me there. It would take me almost 20 years to realize that truth. But I get it now. Now I have a commitment to my feelings, to my sensitivity, to my body.\n\nThis space is where I\u2019m going to start sharing that work. The path I took on that journey. The tools I found along the way. It\u2019s my hope that you might find something here that helps you too. We can walk together.",

        "title": "Apple and Google Join Forces to Track the Spread of Coronavirus",
        "text": "Apple and Google Join Forces to Track the Spread of Coronavirus\n\nNew contact tracing apps could alert users who have been exposed to Covid-19\n\nImage: Apple\n\nGoogle and Apple announced a new partnership on Friday to develop solutions for tracking the spread of the coronavirus. The system will rely on Bluetooth technology in smartphones to alert people who may have been exposed to an infected individual, and it represents a rare bit of cooperation between the competing iOS and Android platforms.\n\nThe technology giants detailed their plans in two announcements (one from Apple, one from Google). In May, the two will introduce APIs for developers to create their own \u201ccontact tracing platforms\u201d on smartphone apps. If you download such an app and cross paths with someone who later uploads a positive test result, you would receive a notification about potential exposure with information about what to do next.\n\nApple and Google say they will eventually update iOS and Android to contain the Bluetooth functionality without an additional app download. Both companies highlighted user privacy in their documentation about the contact tracing feature \u2014 it would require users to opt in, and any data shared would be anonymized.\n\n\u201cAll of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d the companies said in their statement. \u201cThrough close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of [Covid-19] and accelerate the return of everyday life.\u201d\n\nContact tracing is used to map the contacts of someone diagnosed with an infectious disease. Seattle health authorities deployed this method to find their coronavirus Patient Zero, and San Francisco will tap more than 100 volunteers and government employees to interview and plot the movements of everyone testing positive for Covid-19.\n\nA mobile version would follow similar protocols. But instead of relying on interviews to chart the paths of infected people, that crucial information would come from Bluetooth data.\n\nAccording to draft outlines published by Apple and Google, anonymous tracing keys on people\u2019s phones are broadcast every few minutes. These act like beacons that are logged by other nearby devices. (Six feet is considered \u201cclose contact\u201d by health authorities.) If someone is diagnosed with Covid-19, they can submit that information to the app and upload 14 days of proximity data from their phone. People whose devices have exchanged keys with that person will then be alerted in a push notification.\n\nImage: Google\n\nTo reiterate, the companies say this process doesn\u2019t collect data that could be used to track someone. It\u2019s also not mandatory \u2014 a person must download an app and voluntarily state if they\u2019ve been infected.\n\nHowever, there are several barriers that could limit the usefulness of mobile contact tracing.\n\nAs far as accuracy goes, Bluetooth connections are notoriously spotty; as the Washington Post pointed out, it\u2019s unclear how consistently devices will link through car doors and walls.\n\nThe apps also rely on people knowing that they\u2019re sick, and the United States is extremely short on coronavirus testing kits. Theoretically, users could also abuse the app and lie about an infection, a possibility that Signal creator Matthew Rosen (who goes by Moxie Marlinspike) raised in a Twitter thread Friday. Apple declined to state on the record how users will be prevented from submitting false information. Google did not immediately respond to OneZero\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRosen also noted that the technology would require a large amount of data to be downloaded by users every week.\n\nAdoption is another hurdle experienced by countries who\u2019ve already implemented mobile contact tracing. In Singapore, 1 in 6 people opted into a similar program, but participation needed to be closer to three-quarters for the app to be effective.\n\n\u201cDespite our good contact tracing, for nearly half of these cases, we do not know where or from whom the person caught the virus,\u201d Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said of the effort.\n\nAnd marginalized communities who have historically been oppressed by surveillance technology may understandably be wary of downloading such an app.\n\nPrivacy advocates have also cautioned against location-tracking in response to the pandemic. Many countries have already adopted new surveillance measures to track the spread of Covid-19.\n\nIn a paper published Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union outlined several concerns about using location tracking to fight the outbreak. \u201cThe potential for invasions of privacy, abuse, and stigmatization is enormous,\u201d Jay Stanley and Jennifer Stisa Granick, two technology experts at the ACLU, wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Thursday that the agency is drafting a \u201cvery aggressive\u201d contact tracing plan. Redfield told NPR that \u201cpeople are looking at all the different modern technology that could be brought to bear to make contact tracing more efficient and effective.\u201d\n\nThe partnership will expand on Silicon Valley\u2019s tenuous alignment with government agencies. Public health officials will be developing the apps; it\u2019s unclear how long that will take. A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has already begun a similar project.",

        "title": "3 signs of burnout and how to overcome them",
        "text": "Photo by Luis Villasmilon Unsplash\n\nLet\u2019s start with a few questions:\n\nDo you constantly feel exhausted no matter how much sleep you get?\n\nDo you have a sense that nothing you do will make things any better?\n\nDo you find that you care less about things that are usually important to you?\n\nIf your answer is yes to one or more of these questions then you might be suffering from burnout.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising either. A study published last year found that 90% of participants reported feeling stressed \u201cmost of the time\u201d. This was the case before the pandemic which we know is having a significant impact on us, and only adding to an already stressed and overworked population. If \u2018unprecedented\u2019 is the top word of 2020 then \u2018burnout\u2019 is definitely in the top 10. It\u2019s even been recognised by the World Health Organisation who have classified burnout syndrome as an \u201coccupational phenomenon\u201d, describing it as \u201cwork-stress-induced emotional and physical exhaustion\u201d.\n\nI can say that from my personal experience with burnout, it\u2019s a horrible, debilitating and diminishing phenomenon. It rarely comes on its own, and likes to invite its cruel friends \u2014like anxiety and depression \u2014 along to join it. What makes burnout even more worrying is that many of us don\u2019t know that we\u2019re suffering from it, even when we\u2019re close to breaking point. To make matters worse, we\u2019ve developed a toxic workplace culture in the UK where \u201csolidering on\u201d is celebrated, busyness is a status symbol and our self-worth is based on our productivity. This leads us to the reality we live in whereby, when we\u2019re sick, we\u2019re more likely to work through it, with one study suggesting that over 80% of 24 to 35-year-olds don\u2019t take time off when ill. We can only imagine that this is worsened by the recent shift to full-time working from home, where our work and personal boundaries are easily blurred.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Since my most recent experience with burnout earlier this year, which resulted in me being signed off work for a few weeks after a panic attack, I\u2019ve been on a mission to learn more about it, how to identify it and, most of all, how to recover from it. The first step to protecting ourselves or recovering from burnout is to shine a light on the key symptoms, so let\u2019s start there.\n\nThe 3 signs of burnout\n\nThroughout my research, there have been 3 symptoms linked to burnout that have come up time and time again, and they are:\n\nEmotional exhaustion Decreased sense of accomplishment Depersonalisation\n\nI\u2019ll go through each of these one-by-one to share a bit more about what they are and how they show up from my research and personal experience.\n\nEmotional exhaustion\n\nThis is described as the \u201cfatigue that comes from caring too much, for too long\u201d. It can feel like we\u2019re perpetually exhausted, no matter how much we rest. This was a huge one for me, and also the one that took the longest to recover from. I felt like I had been exhausted for years. This was surprising to me as I\u2019m actually a pretty good sleeper \u2014 I\u2019m usually in bed early (before 10pm) and I can get to sleep easily \u2014 but nothing seemed to shift my constant lack of energy.\n\nIt\u2019s clear to me now that I hadn\u2019t really understood, or been aware of, the concept of emotional exhaustion. To me, exhaustion was very much a physical thing, something you get from working out too much or burning the candle at both ends. But now, this idea of caring fatigue really resonates with me. I often describe the moment I met my breaking point as like my mind was split into so many tiny pieces that there was nothing left. What I meant by this was that I was juggling way too many things that I cared deeply about, from client work, internal projects and leadership responsibilities, through to exercising, socialising and being a good friend/partner/daughter/[insert other roles and relationships I was juggling]. The result was that I had nothing left to give to any of them.\n\nThe really scary thing about this particular symptom is that pretty much every system in our body is affected by our emotions. Emotions aren\u2019t just fluffy, innocuous feelings trapped in our mind \u2014 they\u2019re neurological events which means that emotions aren\u2019t just happening in your brain, they\u2019re also playing a role in your entire nervous system. When we get stuck in a long term negative cycle of emotions, like returning to a stressful job everyday, this starts to show up in our physical health, such as weakened blood vessels, digestive problems and even heart disease. This explains why I often felt like I had sore muscles when I was exhausted, even though I hadn\u2019t worked out in weeks.\n\nDecreased sense of accomplishment\n\nThis is the feeling that nothing you do makes any difference, or a deep feeling of pointlessness and futility that you can\u2019t seem to overcome.\n\nThis can play out as a heightened or constant level of self-doubt. You might feel that you\u2019re losing confidence in your ability to do your job, even though you know what you\u2019re doing or you\u2019ve been doing it for years. You might also feel like you\u2019re working harder and harder, but you still seem to accomplish less that you usually would. In a culture that values productivity so highly, and where so many of us determine our self-worth by how productive we are, if we feel that we\u2019re becoming gradually less productive, this can leave us in a pretty hopeless and dark place. As a result, our self-belief starts to plummet.\n\nFor me, this looked like becoming easily overwhelmed by tasks that I\u2019d usually breeze through easily. It\u2019s like my brain could not compute the simplest of tasks anymore. My job is very collaborative which is something that I love about it but, when I was at peak burnout, I found myself increasingly nervous about collaborating due to the risk that my lack of ability would be \u201cfound out\u201d.\n\nThis is a dangerous place to be as it\u2019s an perfect breeding ground for shame. Followers of Bren\u00e9 Brown \u2014 the acclaimed author, speaker and research professor whose spent two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame \u2014 will know all about the threat of shame. Bren\u00e9 describes shame as the painful experience of believing we\u2019re flawed, which leads us to believe that we aren\u2019t worthy or that we\u2019re simply not good enough. The reason shame is so dangerous is that it causes us to shrink, be silent, disconnect and disengage. As humans, we are built for connection and, without it, we start to lose ourselves. This is a slippery slope towards much more devastating conditions such as anxiety, depression and addiction.\n\nDepersonalisation\n\nThe final sign is the sense that we\u2019re losing who we are. It\u2019s often described as an increase in cynacism and a decrease in empathy, caring and compassion. This can manifest itself as a growing feeling of detachment towards your usual personality and self. We might find ourselves saying all too often, \u201cI\u2019m just not feeling myself today.\u201d This is a perfectly natural feeling when it\u2019s felt from time to time, but if it lasts over days, weeks and months then this is something to dig into.\n\nIn our day-to-day, depersonalisation often shows up as no longer finding joy in the things that we love. For example, you might usually be someone who enjoys working with people, but now you find yourself feeling irritated and angry towards them. I\u2019m nodding my head enthusiastically as I type this \u2014 this was me all over. I\u2019m a pretty sociable person, I love hanging out with friends and colleagues, having a laugh and getting to know people better. This is certainly not the case when I\u2019m burnt out. In fact, it\u2019s the last thing I want to do. To put it bluntly, every interaction was an effort and an inconvenience. One of my core values is empathy and this, to me, includes compassion and kindness. I try to cultivate these values in my everyday life but, when I was burnt out, it\u2019s safe to say that these went out the window!\n\nThe scary thing about this one is that it can happen so gradually and subtly over time that we don\u2019t even realise it\u2019s happening, or that it\u2019s being caused by our environment. We can start to embody our personality change and believe this is really who we are now, and there\u2019s nothing we can do to change it. For what it\u2019s worth, we can change it. It is never too late to re-find ourselves and emerge out of the darkness as our true, whole selves. More on that in the next section\u2026\n\nFrom burnout to brightness\n\nAs I mentioned before, the first step to recovering from burnout is developing self- awareness from your ability to notice the signs of burnout and spot them in yourself.\n\nLet\u2019s now move on from doom and gloom of what it feels like to have burnout and onto how we can tell it to do one. The good news is that the strategies we need to recover from burnout are actually pretty simple. However, the bad news is that if you were hoping for some crazy, magical revelation that you haven\u2019t heard before then you\u2019re going to be disappointed. That\u2019s not to say that the strategies are easy, if they were then we\u2019d all be doing them and I wouldn\u2019t be writing this blog right now. Just because something is simple to understand doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s easy to put into practice.\n\nFrom my experience, I believe that there are 5 \u201ccures\u201d for burnout. These are what have been most impactful for me and they are:\n\nSleep and rest Calm and stillness Healthy boundaries Time in nature Purpose and meaning\n\nAs I did in the last section, I\u2019ll go through each of these one-by-one and share a bit more about why I believe each one is so impactful.\n\nSleep and rest\n\nIf you saw this and rolled your eyes then, believe me, I\u2019m with you. It sounds so obvious that it\u2019s almost patronising. I get it. But the truth is the truth \u2014 and that is that we are a chronically sleep-deprived nation. Few of us prioritise getting 7\u20138 hours sleep like our life depends on it (which studies show that it does, with one suggesting that if you\u2019re sleeping for less than seven hours a night, you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice as grave as that of smoking). And even when we\u2019re so exhausted that we can barely keep our eyes open, we find that we still struggle to get to sleep due to our minds buzzing with to-do lists, stress and anxiety. So I understand that it\u2019s not as simple as, \u201cjust sleep more\u201d.\n\nThe slower pace of life that this years lockdown forced upon us helped me to understand how sleep-deprived I was, and what rest really meant. It hasn\u2019t been easy and I would estimate that it\u2019s taken me upward of 3 months of practicing good sleep hygiene to finally get my energy back.\n\nFor me, good sleep hygiene includes:\n\nGiving myself at least an 8 hour sleep opportunity every night\n\nGetting into bed around 9pm so that I\u2019m in bed longer to meet the above\n\nReading in bed for 30\u201345 minutes with a dimming night light\n\nAvoiding screens and blue lights at least an hour before I go to bed\n\nDrinking chamomile or calming tea in the evening\n\nUsing a sunrise light rather than a sound alarm to wake me up so that I wake naturally\n\nUsing a sleep tracker (I have a Fitbit) to track my sleep quality and see what works for me\n\nIn terms of rest, I\u2019ve benefited a hell of a lot this year from embracing my introverted side and allowing myself to not always be busy doing, socialising or producing. I\u2019ve learnt the beauty and peace of being still, of allowing myself to be quiet and actually enjoy relaxing. In the past, rest and relaxation was a foreign concept for me. I think it\u2019s fair to say that I felt significantly unrelaxed when I wasn\u2019t being productive with my time, whether that was during the work week or at the weekends. I was perpetually busy. Hence my burnout. Obviously I haven\u2019t had much choice but to chill the fff out but I now see that protecting time in my schedule to relax, nap, read, have a bath or just not be on the go all the time is an absolute must.\n\nCalm and stillness\n\nOn a related note, practicing calm and stillness is about managing anxiety and emotional reactivity. I\u2019ve learnt that it is massively linked to mindfulness. I used to believe that mindfulness was synonymous to meditation. They were basically the same thing in my mind. What I know now is that mindfulness is actually about having perspective and is the way in which we manage our emotions and impulses. Meditation is one way to do this but it\u2019s not the only way.\n\nWhat\u2019s worked for me is journalling and regular self-reflection. I\u2019m quite a reflective person anyway but making this a more intentional practice has been incredibly powerful for me. Every Sunday, I make time to reflect on the week that has passed, considering what went well, what didn\u2019t and why. I then think about the week ahead and set myself small, specific goals and consider what I need to do to make this happen and what might get in my way. It\u2019s a quiet moment that I spend with myself every week. It\u2019s not about giving myself a hard time for things I haven\u2019t done. It\u2019s acknowledging, questioning and looking forward. I\u2019ve also got into more general journalling, using guided journalling books like \u20185 Minutes to a Mindful You\u2019 and \u2018The 6-Minute Diary\u2019 which prove that even 5 minutes of calm and stillness each day can have a big and positive impact.\n\nHealthy boundaries\n\nHere we have another alien concept for me \u2014 you are probably noticing some themes here about the person I once was. When I talk about boundaries, I\u2019m referring to little rules that we put in place, internally or openly, that protect our energy and wellbeing. For example, when we\u2019re contactable, when we need alone time or even who we\u2019re friends with.\n\nI now believe that boundaries are so important, so much so that I think we should be taught about them from an early age and through school. Even so, I\u2019ve found that setting boundaries isn\u2019t easy, and sticking to them is even harder. Often they involve saying no to people, sometimes those we love, and that can be tough. But the upside of having boundaries is not only do they protect our wellbeing, but they also improve our relationships and interactions, as we\u2019re essentially sharing more of ourselves and how we best operate.\n\nThese are the boundaries that I\u2019ve developed this year that are most important to me:\n\nI\u2019m strict about when I start and finish work so that I have time to myself before and after work.\n\nI don\u2019t have any work apps (such as Outlook and Slack) downloaded on my phone so I\u2019m only contactable when I\u2019m \u201conline\u201d which basically means when I\u2019m on my work laptop.\n\nI block out \u201cfocus time\u201d in my work calendar which is time where I can get into a flow state without distractions, and I protect this time like it\u2019s a client meeting.\n\nI always take a lunch break for at least an hour.\n\nI no longer book social meet-ups in the closest available gap in my calendar, I spread them out so that I always have time to relax each week.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that a lot of mine are work-related and that\u2019s because my stressors were heavily linked to my job, but boundaries don\u2019t have to be work related. They could be with friends, family, romantic partners, hobbies, communities, or any other aspect pf your life that you feel needs them.\n\nTime in nature\n\nIt\u2019s well known that spending time in nature and making time to be outside in green space can benefit our mental wellbeing. It might be hundreds of years since we were living our best hunter-gatherer lives but our need for connection with nature hasn\u2019t waned even as we\u2019ve become more and more disconnected from it. Being in nature is basically in our DNA.\n\nI\u2019ve found that when I make time to go for a walk in nature in the morning, I have a better day after that. I feel calmer and more reflective, rather than anxious or reactive. It\u2019s a combination of breathing fresh air, feeling sun or wind on my skin, and taking a moment to see the expanse before me that being outside allows. Especially now that we\u2019re in our homes for such prolonged periods, it can feel like we\u2019re trapped inside many boxes. I live in a 2-bedroom flat in London which really does feel like a small box sometimes with few options to go to. I then spend my working day in another, even smaller box which is my laptop screen. My daily outside time is an escape from the boxes, and a time for me to check in with myself and the world around me.\n\nPurpose and meaning\n\nThis last one might seem a little strange but it\u2019s a biggie. For me, purpose is about doing things for a reason that is higher than materialistic gain. It\u2019s a reason to get up in the morning and what helps us to go to sleep at night feeling grateful and fulfilled. However, when we lose our sense of purpose and meaning in our lives, it can send us into some really dark and uncertain places. We need our purpose to show us the light and bring us back to what\u2019s important.\n\n\n\nThis is even more important now as we\u2019ve seen our normal life pulled from beneath our feet. We all need a sense of purpose to keep us going and to help us to see that there is still something worthwhile, evenwhen the noise of normality goes quiet. When I reflect back on my experience with burnout, I think that part of what led me to overwork was because I didn\u2019t know what I was striving for. So I would work myself harder and harder, while burdened by perfectionism, in a desperate pursuit for meaning. The problem was that it never felt good enough.\n\nIt\u2019s been a big year for me in terms of \u201cfinding myself\u201d (yes, I\u2019m cringing too) and what\u2019s important for me. Now that I\u2019m clear on this, I feel much more at ease. I\u2019m able to prioritise how I spend my time with clarity and confidence. It\u2019s made it easier for me to say no to things that don\u2019t align to my purpose and values. I have something to come back to when I feel that something isn\u2019t right and question what might be conflicting with what I believe to make me feel this way\n\nTo get closer to my purpose, I started by asking myself these 3 questions:\n\nWhat gets me up in the morning?\n\nWhen do I feel that I add the most value?\n\nWhat do I want to be remembered for?\n\nI also used an adapted version of the ikigai framework to help me narrow in further which you can see below:\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what my purpose is, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s always evolving but what I\u2019ve settled on for now is this:",

        "text": "350-Word Story\n\nMore Of The Violin Taste\n\nEpisode #6\n\nImage by Bairyna from Pixabay\n\nVivianne smiled when she had that violin in her hands. It felt so natural like she had done this for ages. As Vivianne smiled much more because of touching the strings better and better every time she tried playing a string.\n\nShe saw her mother smiling too. That is what a mother always wanted for her child. Her child being happy. Maybe it is the spirit she has on her shoulders that she could afford one lesson, and then see what is possible for Vivianne.\n\nThe teacher was also very nice, which is a bonus for children. not too strict and not too nice. David also saw that Vivianne has some talent. She and her mother need to do something with that talent of Vivianne. That must be cherished. He also saw that she loved playing the violin.\n\n\u201cYour daughter is a very talented violinist. You should encourage her to stay playing the violin.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I talk to you for a second, without my daughter?\u201d\n\nDavid was surprised that she wanted to talk to him privately. Was that appropriate to feel something? He was young, but he might become her daughter\u2019s teacher. That will give him some trouble. He might be single, there is also his child that gives him a hand full of issues.\n\n\u201cWhy without me?\u201d\n\nDisappointed and with a sad face, she walked out of the room. her thoughts were that she was not allowed to continue playing the violin. A few tears came over her cheeks. She felt somehow disadvantaged that she was not allowed to listen to what was said. Wasn\u2019t it right? Was she a bad violinist?\n\nWhen Vivianne was out of the room, Harriette turned towards the teacher. His eyes sparkled a little bit while he turned his whole body towards her. When he turned towards her, she felt a sparkle in her stomach. Why now? She didn\u2019t want to feel this. She didn\u2019t have any time for a relationship. She started to stumble upon the words.\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t have any money for violin lessons. So, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",

        "title": "Clarifying the True Fatality Rate of Covid-19: Same as the Flu?",
        "text": "Clarifying the True Fatality Rate of Covid-19: Same as the Flu?\n\n[updated Oct] Comparing fatality rate jargons may lead to nowhere, but there are better metrics to grasp the health toll of Covid-19.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Please see an update at the end of the article too.\n\nOn 11 March 2020, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told the U.S. Congress House Oversight and Reform Committee that the novel coronavirus \u2014 that causes Covid-19 \u2014 has a mortality rate of 10-times higher than the seasonal flu.\n\nSpecifically, at the congressional hearing, the NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci said, \u201cThe flu has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. This [Covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2] has a mortality rate of 10 times that. That\u2019s the reason I want to emphasize we have to stay ahead of the game in preventing this.\u201d\n\n10 x 0.1% = 1%.\n\nIn other words, Dr. Fauci reported that Covid-19 has a mortality rate of 1%, which he said had fallen from 2\u20133% after taking into account asymptomatic (i.e., symptomless) infections.\n\nBut what did Dr. Fauci mean by mortality rate?\n\nIn an editorial published on 29 February in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) \u2014 co-authored by Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the CDC, and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, deputy director of NIAID \u2014 Dr. Fauci stated that influenza \u201chas a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Dr. Fauci refers to the case fatality rate (CFR) when he said, \u201cThe flu has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent.\u201d\n\nBut he should have said the infection fatality rate (IFR). Why?\n\nThe CFR is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of people that have the disease\u2019s symptoms. In contrast, the IFR is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of people that carry the infection.\n\nThe confusion between \u2018case\u2019 and \u2018infection\u2019 fatality rates (CFR vs. IFR)\n\nIn contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the flu has an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.1% or lower.\n\nWho is right?\n\nThe WHO who said influenza has an IFR of 0.1% or lower, or\n\nThe NIAID and CDC directors who said influenza has a CFR of 0.1%?\n\nIn an article published August in the journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, titled \u201cPublic health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation,\u201d Dr. Ronald B. Brown at the University of Waterloo in Canada shed light on this confusion.\n\n\u201cA case fatality rate (CFR) is defined as the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases of the disease,\u201d Dr. Brown said, \u201c\u2026while an infection fatality rate (IFR) is defined as the proportion of deaths relative to the prevalence of infections within a population.\u201d\n\nThe catch is that cases refer only to those with clinical symptoms of the disease. Hence, asymptomatic (i.e., symptomless) people are not considered as a case.\n\nMathematically speaking, the CFR is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of people that have the disease\u2019s symptoms. In contrast, the IFR is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of people that carry the infection, regardless of them having clinical symptoms or not.\n\n\u201cIFRs from samples across the population include undiagnosed, asymptomatic, and mild infections, and are often lower compared to CFRs, which are based exclusively on relatively smaller groups of moderately to severely ill diagnosed cases at the beginning of an outbreak,\u201d Dr. Brown continued.\n\n(Note that the mortality rate has its own definition: The total number of deaths per population of 100,000 persons. But people typically refer to the CFR or IFR when talking about mortality rate.)\n\nThe WHO got it right, Dr. Brown said, in that influenza has an IFR of 0.1% or lower, not a CFR of 0.1%.\n\nDr. Fauci reported that Covid-19 has a mortality rate of 1%, which he said had fallen from 2\u20133% after taking into account asymptomatic infections.\n\nAnd Dr. Fauci probably meant to say that Covid-19 has an IFR of 1% (not CFR of 1%) after having considered asymptomatic infections.\n\nThe true fatality rate of Covid-19\n\nTo reiterate, Dr. Fauci said the Covid-19 mortality rate dropped from 2\u20133% to 1% after adjusting for asymptomatic infections. \u201cThe coronavirus mortality rate of 2\u20133% that was adjusted to 1% in Congressional testimony is consistent with the coronavirus CFR of 1.8\u20133.4% (median 2.6%) reported by the CDC,\u201d Dr. Brown explained.\n\nThus, among those who became symptomatic, Covid-19 is not any deadlier than the flu. This had led to the notion that lockdowns were not necessary as Covid-19 is just like the seasonal flu.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the WHO reported that the CFR of the H1N1 influenza virus is also 2\u20133%, similar to the unadjusted 2\u20133% CFR of the coronavirus reported in Congressional testimony, with no meaningful difference in mortality,\u201d he added. \u201cEvidence from the WHO confirmed that the approximate CFR of the coronavirus is generally no higher than that of seasonal influenza.\u201d\n\nAs follows,\n\nCovid-19 has an IFR of 1% and CFR of 2\u20133%. More recent data by the CDC and WHO, however, estimates that Covid-19 has an IFR of 0.65% and 0.5-1%, respectively.\n\nThe flu has an IFR of 0.1% or lower and CFR of 2\u20133%. (Please also see the update below about this.)\n\nThus, among those who became symptomatic (i.e., CFR), Covid-19 is not any deadlier than the flu. This had led to the notion that lockdowns were not necessary as Covid-19 is just like the seasonal flu.\n\nOverall, a higher transmission rate leads to more infections and then more cases and, eventually, more deaths. Now, the CFR alone is not as important.\n\nBut such proponents seem to have been confused about the differences between CFR and IFR, as Dr. Fauci and others did. Among the total infection events (i.e., IFR), Covid-19 is still 6.5-times deadlier than the flu.\n\nThis means that a person is more likely to become a case (symptomatic) when infected with SARS-CoV-2 than with the influenza virus. The main reason is that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus in which little preexisting immunity exists, so a lot more infected people will get sick.\n\nThe true health burden of Covid-19\n\nEven if the IFRs of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza might be the same, as some data may suggest, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious with a basic reproductive number (R-naught) of 2.5. This means an infected person can pass the virus to two people or so, resulting in 2000+ infections after ten rounds of transmissions. The flu, by contrast, has an R-naught of 1.3, which equates to 56 infections after ten rounds.\n\nFurther, SARS-CoV-2 has a longer incubation period, the period between infection and symptom onset, than influenza (approx. 5\u201312 vs. 2 days). This means that asymptomatic people can stay infectious for a longer time and, thus, more widespread silent viral transmission.\n\nThe fact that Covid-19 kills more than flu is quickly evident by \u201cthe number of deaths that exceed what is seen in typical years.\u201d\n\nOverall, a higher transmission rate leads to more infections and then more cases and, eventually, more deaths. Now, the CFR alone is not as important. Not to mention also that SARS-CoV-2 infections are more likely to become cases than with influenza.\n\nThe fact that Covid-19 kills more than flu is quickly evident by \u201cthe number of deaths that exceed what is seen in typical years,\u201d the academic journal Nature reported in September. In other words, deaths from Covid-19 are not deaths that \u2018would happen anyway\u2019.\n\nSource: Nature\n\nMore info on excess mortality or deaths in 2020 vs. previous years:\n\nSource: ourworldindata.org. Similar data on other countries (e.g., the USA, Sweden, Germany, Spain, Netherlands, etc.) can be found here.\n\n14 September 2020 update/corrections on CFR\n\nAn email asked for the specific source of the IFR and CFR of the flu, which is <0.1% and 2\u20133%, respectively, in this article. I then realized that Dr. Brown cited the IFR of the seasonal flu, but CFR of the Spanish flu pandemic. For the seasonal flu, the CFR is 0.1%.\n\nSo, Dr. Fauci is right to say that the seasonal flu has a CFR of 0.1%, although he compared this CFR of flu with the IFR of Covid-19 (i.e., 1%). In this way, it is an underestimate when Dr. Fauci said that the mortality rate of Covid-19 is 10-times higher than the flu. Thus, the prior numbers I cited overestimate the lethality of the flu and discredited Dr. Fauci, which I sincerely apologize.\n\n8 October 2020 updates/corrections on IFR\n\nThe CDC has changed the IFR values of Covid-19 into age-specific estimates, which are now very low at 0.003% for 0\u201319 years, 0.02% for 20\u201349 years, 0.5% for 50\u201369 years, and 5.4% for 70+ years.\n\nBut there seems to be no data on age-specific IFR of the seasonal flu. The WHO only stated that \u201cthe infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%.\u201d How much below 0.1% is unclear. Admittedly, comparing mortality rates between Covid-19 and the seasonal flu may lead to nowhere. Perhaps we should look at other metrics instead, such as R-naught and excess deaths.",

        "title": "Two More Ways Covid Has Stolen Our Health and Happiness, and How We Can Fight Back",
        "text": "COVID has stolen so much from us. It\u2019s taken our comforting routines, our sense of safety, and even smaller things that bring us pleasure, such as eating out, going to the movies, and getting together with friends. And if you\u2019re like me, the loss of these things, combined with the endless fear and anxiety of catching the virus, has taken a major toll on your mental health.\n\nAs a matter of fact, research points to the fact that some of our feelings of hopelessness and COVID-induced depression may be related to two everyday things that most of us took for granted pre-pandemic: smiles and hugs.\n\nThe power of smiles\n\nFor many of us, it\u2019s never been harder to smile than right now. The extended presence of this pandemic feels like the world as we know it is falling to pieces, and what was often the cure for our gloom pre-COVID is no longer available: the uplifting smile of another person.\n\nIt\u2019s not just an old adage that smiles are contagious. It\u2019s a scientifically proven fact. An article in Psychology Today states that \u201cthe part of your brain that is responsible for your facial expression of smiling when happy or mimicking another\u2019s smile resides in the cingulate cortex, an unconscious automatic response area.\u201d\n\nIn other words, when we see someone smile, it\u2019s extremely hard not to smile back. After all, attempting not to smile in response to this situation is like trying to override our brain\u2019s natural tendencies. And think of all the automatic smiles we miss out on because we are surrounded by people whose smiles are hidden behind masks, masks that if gone would make us happier as well.\n\nFor example, in the past, our co-workers smiled when they greeted us in the morning, our cashier smiled when we met them at the checkout counter, and our bank tellers, our doctors, and even our fast-food workers smiled at us in the drive-thru. But in our \u201cnew normal,\u201d this is simply not the case, meaning all those reflexive bursts of happiness are gone.\n\nSo less smiling faces directed our way means less smiling for us, and that very fact has a major impact on both our physical and emotional health.\n\nDebbie Hampton, author of Beat Depression and Anxiety by Changing Your Brain, states that smiling \u201creleases feel-good transmitters, including dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin.\u201d She then goes on to list all of the physical and emotional advantages that these hormones bring, benefits that are absent when we do not engage in the act of smiling.\n\nAnd the side effects of not getting enough of these \u201cfeel good\u201d hormones? Higher heart rate and blood pressure. Lack of motivation. Dwindling self-confidence. Increased pain. And these are just a few short examples.\n\nThe National Institute of Health reports research done on smiling by Jared Martin and Dr. Paula Niedenthal at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. These researchers characterized all smiles as being one of three types: dominance smiles, affiliation smiles, and reward smiles. Dominance smiles are negatives smiles that convey a sense of smugness and superiority, while affiliation and reward smiles are smiles that show true happiness and increase social connections between people.\n\nAfter doing studies on the effects of these smiles, they found that those who received dominance smiles from others showed a rise in cortisol, often referred to as the \u201cstress hormone,\u201d but those who received affiliation and reward smiles saw a reduction in this hormone, thus proving that most types of smiles serve to counteract the damaging effects of stress.\n\nAnd in addition to the repercussions of limited \u201csmile sightings,\u201d this pandemic also robs us of another emotional and physical stress reliever: hugs.\n\nThe benefits of hugs and human touch\n\nWe\u2019re told to stay six feet away from others. That means no pat on the back or high fives when we\u2019ve done something great, but also means something much sadder: no hugs.\n\nWe give or receive hugs to show compassion, to share moments of joy, and to convey unspoken feelings of love or understanding. And for most of us, these hugs bring both a needed emotional release and increased happiness.\n\nBut once again, at the present, these emotional rewards cannot be experienced.\n\nIn Well and Good, they list a number of advantages of those daily hugs that are now practically non-existent. Just as with smiling, they state that hugging reduces levels of cortisol. However, they also mention that lowered cortisol does more than relieve stress, it also benefits our immune system. The article cites research findings that conclude \u201cpeople who experienced hugs more frequently were less likely to get sick and that even if they did get sick their symptoms were less intense.\u201d\n\nSo what does this mean for us? Less hugging means more susceptibility to sickness. And at times like these, a compromised immune system is especially dangerous.\n\nHugging can do also do things such as reduce blood pressure and lower heart rate. For example, Healthline reports a study in which scientists had romantic partners do one of two things: hold hands and hug or sit in silence together. The hand-holding and hugging couples showed lowered blood pressure and heart rate, benefits absent from the distant couples who remained untouched.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nWe can\u2019t change the fact that most of the physical and emotional advantages of smiling and hugging will continue to be absent from our lives, but we can increase the opportunities to seize the benefits of these things by creating more joy and incorporating more touch in our lives with our immediate family. We can watch more funny movies together, play more games that induce laughter and smiles, and make more attempts to wrap our arms around those with whom we share a home. And let\u2019s be honest, virus or not, we need to do more of these things anyway, don\u2019t we? So let\u2019s get to it.",

        "text": "The effect of color on user\u2019s behavior can\u2019t be overestimated, especially when it comes to web design. The virtual user can\u2019t touch the product or service physically, therefore well-chosen colors and user-friendly interface based on user experience are the most powerful tools of online communication. Which colors will help to increase website conversion and the mobile apps popularity?\n\nColor psychology\n\nStudies show that it takes 90 seconds for a customer to form the opinion about the project and 90% of this opinion is influenced by the color. Two out of three consumers will make a large purchase only if they like its shade, and almost 93% of people primarily perceive visual information. That\u2019s why so many people love infographics \u2014 it is much easier to perceive the same data visually:\n\nCreating a pen portrait of the target consumer\n\nDepending on the age, gender and impulsivity of actions users have different reaction on colors and shades.\n\nAge\n\nThe optimism of the youth \u2014 young audience loves vibrant saturated colors. As for older consumers, you should be careful with bright colors \u2014 too vibrant can decrease the conversion. Mature users, often think garish bright colors repulsive.\n\nMen vs Women\n\nColor perception research shows that men prefer bright, contrasting colors, while women prefer softer shades. Both men and women like blue and green, but many women adore purple meanwhile, this color repels men.",

        "text": "Your Medium story can be short, long, or somewhere in the middle.\n\nAnd you should absolutely write your story to the length it needs to be. I\u2019ve written and published poems to Medium, which are usually 1-minute reads (sometimes they\u2019re as short as 40 or 50 words!). My stories about fiction writing and writing for Medium are typically 3-to-5-minute reads, with only the occasional outlier.\n\nI\u2019ve also published short stories and personal essays and analyses of books that run anywhere between 7-minute reads and 15-minute reads. I\u2019ve tried pretty much every length imaginable (well, maybe not a 60-minute read, but never say never!).\n\nTo some extent, the length of your piece doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent it from being a success. I\u2019ve seen short 2-minute how-to pieces that have 1,000 or more claps. I\u2019ve seen 39-minute reads that got 5,000 claps. I\u2019ve seen it all throughout my many months writing for Medium.\n\nDon\u2019t ever think that you have to write a 4-minute read every single time.

        "title": "How Startups Outsource Their Tech Without Going Broke or Getting Screwed",
        "text": "How Startups Outsource Their Tech Without Going Broke or Getting Screwed\n\nA takedown of the traditional technical build proposal\n\nShould you spend $50,000 to build out your tech?\n\nThis is not as uncommon a question as you might think. As crazy as it sounds, quite a few entrepreneurs have access to that kind of money. Or at least they think they do.\n\nWhat most entrepreneurs don\u2019t have is a technical background. Thus, most entrepreneurs are forced to rely on someone else to build out their tech. Not only that, most entrepreneurs are forced to trust someone else to build out their tech without charging them a fortune for shoddy work and layers of unnecessary billable hours.\n\nHere\u2019s how to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen to you.\n\nTrap #1: Don\u2019t spend money you don\u2019t have\n\nBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen dozens of different ways for a $50K tech spend to evolve from \u201ccrazy idea\u201d to \u201cjust might work,\u201d whether it\u2019s with credit cards, loans, friends and family, or the old standard of giving away 10% of the company to get an MVP built.\n\nIn fact, a couple weeks ago, an entrepreneur asked me to review a proposal for $2.3 million worth of tech build \u2014 before the entrepreneur\u2019s startup was even incorporated. I was surprised, but not shocked, and a little mad at the tech firm, whom I did not know.\n\nBut ultimately, the fault was with the entrepreneur, in the sense that they asked for all the wrong things at the wrong time. When an entrepreneur has money, or access to it, or they believe they do, that problem can wind up hurting a lot of people, including the firm that agrees to build the tech.\n\nTrap #2: Don\u2019t spend all the money you DO have\n\nVery few technical firms are sketchy, but most of them will build what you ask them to build. Most. Some are even altruistic. I\u2019m reminded of a conversation I had with one of my tech-firm-founder friends:\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t take $50,000 from a startup if that\u2019s all they have,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll end up building beautiful tech for them and it\u2019ll just sit there and do nothing because they don\u2019t have money to spend on sales, marketing, even changes to the tech when they realize they\u2019ve built something only half of their customers are using.\u201d\n\nThink about all of your funding as a budget. Your tech should never be more than 50% of that budget \u2014 and then \u2014 that 50% should include your original spend to build, plus the costs of maintaining, supporting, upgrading, even wholesale changes to that build once it comes into contact with your customers.\n\nSo your original spend to build should probably be something like 25% of your company budget.\n\nHow do you work under that tight constraint?\n\nTrap #3: Don\u2019t build everything at once\n\nMost of the tech proposals I see are out-the-door pricing for the build of an entire product. Then usually the firm either walks away or tacks on a program to support exactly what they built.\n\nThis will get your startup to launch, but not much further.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a full feature set, but you need to deliver value.\n\nMost entrepreneurs design their product from beta all the way to version two and beyond. Me included. I design all kinds of infrastructure, administration, even reports and bells and whistles. This design is necessary, and the better-built products usually wind up coming from the better-designed products.\n\nBut even the best design doesn\u2019t need to be built all at once. Not every feature needs to be live the first time the product gets put in front of the customer.\n\nWithout getting too much into Minimum Viable Product theory, what needs to be there is the bare minimum that gets the customer to experience the most value in the shortest time.\n\nThat\u2019s usually a subset of the full product. And since almost all technical architecture is open and flexible these days, your technical resource doesn\u2019t need to validate every future feature or process. They just need to know what\u2019s coming and how it\u2019s designed so they don\u2019t wall off that future functionality.\n\nYou don\u2019t need scale, but you need options.\n\nBuilding for a million users when you have no users is like spending a million dollars when you have no revenue.\n\nNo matter how many customers you eventually plan to have, you don\u2019t need accommodate all of them out of the gate. Again, we\u2019re at a place where most technical tools and coding strategies have the flexibility to expand built in.\n\nSo much like open feature design, you need open scale design. In other words, your technical resource should be smart enough and forward-thinking enough to not do anything that would prevent scale down the road.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to rebuild any wheels.\n\nThe reason why there are multiple no-code options for building apps these days is because a lot of code has been packaged into reusable and universal chunks. A lot of those chunks are offered by third parties, more robustly and inexpensively than anything you and your technical resource can build.\n\nIf there is a third party offering for some of your non-critical functionality, use that third party, at least temporarily. Focus your initial build on the technology that is critical for the customer finding value in your product.\n\nTrap #4: Don\u2019t look for a provider, look for a partner.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve got your design broken up and prioritized, this is a golden opportunity to vet whatever firm or individual is going to build your tech.\n\nDo they understand how a startup should operate?\n\nDo they get that you\u2019re going to spend in small increments, go away and test, and then come back with changes?\n\nAre they willing to take the risk of inconvenience to their billing cycle for the reward of your success?\n\nYou don\u2019t need Agile, but you need to be agile\n\nThe proposal I mentioned earlier was a series of a dozen two-week sprints, back-to-back, each for a different feature of the product. As is the case with Agile development, each two-week sprint would end with a review process that would trigger the next sprint.\n\nThis is where I got a little mad. What exactly did that tech firm imagine would happen in those reviews?\n\nActually, I knew the answer. The review would be a checklist with the entrepreneur to make sure the firm had built exactly what the entrepreneur asked for. This is for the tech firm to justify their next billing cycle.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter what the entrepreneur thinks of the tech. What matters is what the entrepreneur\u2019s customers think of the tech. The entrepreneur needs time to validate this.\n\nYou need to manage the project.\n\nNever, ever pay for a project manager or any other kind of administrator that comes from the firm itself. The firm\u2019s job is to build what you want and get it done on time. If you don\u2019t trust them to do that, and if you don\u2019t trust yourself to be able to manage that, hire a third party to manage the firm.\n\nTrap #5: Don\u2019t go into the selection process uneducated\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a new or used car, you don\u2019t necessarily need to know mechanical and electrical engineering up and down. But you should know what undercoating is and whether or not you need it.\n\nThere are a million documents on the web that explain technology and what it does. Most of them are boring and complicated, but some aren\u2019t.\n\nYou should know, at a minimum:\n\nHow cloud availability and SaaS works.\n\nWhat a tech stack is and what some of the differences are from stack to stack.\n\nThe popular coding languages, databases, and backends and a little about why you\u2019d choose what.\n\nHow security, privacy, and backups work.\n\nYou should always ask other entrepreneurs which firms they have used and why. You should always talk to the clients listed on the websites of the firms you\u2019re considering.\n\nTrap #6: Don\u2019t pay by the hour\n\nIf you pay by the hour, you\u2019ll always be questioning the firm\u2019s methods, and whether you\u2019re asking for something simple or complicated. You\u2019ll subconsciously nickel-and-dime your product to death.\n\nPay by the project, or better yet, pay by functionality. If you\u2019ve designed your product thoroughly, even if it\u2019s just words on paper, they\u2019ll be able to price it out. This means you\u2019ll be able to prioritize functionality for your customers, and you\u2019ll be able to come back and make the inevitable changes to functionality as the product hits the market.\n\nTrap #7: Protect yourself\n\nI get this question a lot \u2014 How do you prevent the firm from taking your idea and your tech and doing it themselves. The answer is: You can\u2019t.\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve got an NDA in place with the firm, and make sure you own the source code and that you have unfettered access to it.\n\nA startup succeeds on their execution, not the idea, not the tech, and not the implementation of that tech. If you really think the technical firm can out-execute you on your own idea, or if you think they\u2019ll just sell your tech to someone else, don\u2019t do business with them.\n\nLike I said, there are plenty of good, altruistic tech firms out there.\n\nHey!

        "title": "Long-Covid Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Treatments: New Insights",
        "text": "Long-Covid Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Treatments: New Insights\n\nMore than 5 initial symptoms predict long-Covid. And a drug just passed phase III clinical trial for chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nHand vector created by freepik \u2014 www.freepik.com\n\nAs with any other systemic disease, Covid-19 may bring systemic complications that may not resolve so soon. We identify them as long-haulers, long-Covid, post-viral Covid-19 syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Importantly, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test is not important for long-Covid diagnosis.\n\nWe understand what they look like and the probable causes. But how much do we know about its risk factors, namely, what traits make a patient more likely to develop long-Covid, and its potential treatments?\n\nPrevalence and cause\n\nThe prevalence of long-Covid depends on the population studied. For example, a study in China detected residual lung abnormalities in 25% of discharged Covid-19 patients in a 3-month follow-up, of whom 31% still had gastrointestinal distress, 18% had headaches, 16% had fatigue, and 15% had dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\nA study in Italy, on the other hand, followed 179 Covid-19 patients for two months. They uncovered one or two lingering symptoms in 32% of patients and three or more in 55%. Common symptoms were fatigue (53%), dyspnea (43%), joint pain (27%), and chest pain (22%).\n\nOther data from King\u2019s College London that studied over 4000 Covid-19 patients found that 13% of patients had persisting symptoms for at least 28 days, of which over 90% had fatigue and headache. This study further discovered a few risk factors for long-Covid, as discussed below.\n\nReasons for Covid-19 long-haulers, scientists believe, are due to the residual tissue damage or the aberrant immune responses that persist despite that the coronavirus may no longer be present, or both. More details here:\n\nRisk factors\n\nTwo new preprints released in October have tracked a sufficient number of Covid-19 patients to identify the possible risk factors of long-haulers. While preprints have not gone through peer-review yet, these two are from research institutions with a good academic publishing record.\n\nThe presence of more than five symptoms during the first week of illness predicted 16.3% of cases [of long-Covid].\n\nPart I: King\u2019s College London\n\nResearchers at King\u2019s College London authored one of the preprints, titled \u201cAttributes and predictors of Long-COVID: analysis of COVID cases and their symptoms collected by the Covid Symptoms Study App.\u201d This study is led by Claire J. Steves, an honorary consultant physician in geriatric medicine and deputy director of the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, with over 70 published academic papers.\n\nThis study followed 4,182 Covid-19 patients in Sweden, Great Britain, and the U.S. for several months. In the end, they found 13% of patients had symptoms lasting more than 28 days. This number was 4.5% and 2.3% for those suffering symptoms for more than 56 and 95 days, respectively.\n\nThe study then pinpointed risk factors that all together could predict 76.7% of long-Covid cases. The researchers also tested their predictive model in another dataset of 2,472 Covid-19 patients, which proved their model\u2019s accuracy and generalizability. Individual risk factors are ranked as follows:\n\nThe old age of 70 years and above predicted 29.2% of cases. The presence of more than five symptoms during the first week of illness predicted 16.3% of cases. A high body mass index of 27.5 and above predicted 10.3% of cases. Horse voice symptoms predicted 4.1% of cases. Shortness of breath symptom predicted 3.8% of cases. Female sex predicted 3.7% of cases. In those aged 70 and above, fever, loss of smell, and comorbidities (particularly heart and lung diseases) were also predictors. Socioeconomic status was not a predictor.\n\nLastly, the authors pointed out their study\u2019s limitations, which include the dominance of females and those younger than 70 years. Data on race were also lacking, preventing risk factor analysis. And data relied on self-reports, which may not be as accurate as doctors\u2019 assessments.\n\nRegardless, both studies identified more than five initial symptoms and shortness of breath as predictors of long-Covid.\n\nPart II: Helix\n\nThe second preprint, \u201cLong-term COVID-19 symptoms in a large unselected population,\u201d is from Helix, a population genomics research center in California. This study used survey data from over 20,000 participants of the Helix DNA Discovery and Healthy Nevada Projects. But only 233 people had Covid-19, and most were not tested. Prevalence of long-Covid was 42%, 34%, and 24% after 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively.\n\nThis study only found three risk factors of long-Covid: more than five initial symptoms, shortness of breath, and blood type A+. In contrast, sex, BMI, or comorbidities were not associated with long-Covid.\n\nEvidently, this study is weaker than the King\u2019s College London study Dr. Steves led \u2014 owing to the smaller sample size while also using self-reports. Regardless, both studies identified more than five initial symptoms and shortness of breath as predictors of long-Covid.\n\nSubtypes and unique symptoms\n\nAnother interesting finding from Dr. Steves\u2019s study were the two subtypes of long-Covid. One type is the combo of fatigue, headache, and upper respiratory tract symptoms like shortness of breath, sore throat, persistent cough, or smell loss. The second type is a multi-system complication with ongoing fever and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nAlthough rare, science has recently described new and unique aspects of long-Covid ranging from symptoms of the heart, brain, peripheral nervous system, ear, and skin.\n\nDr. Steves et al. also noticed a few symptoms unique to long-Covid. Using short-Covid-19 patients as a comparison group, these were cardiac symptoms like palpitations or tachycardia (6.1% vs. 0.5%), concentration or memory problems (4.1% vs. 0.2%), tinnitus and earache (3.6% vs. 0.2%), and peripheral nerve symptoms like prickling or tingling sensation and numbness (2% vs. 0.5%). These differences reached statistical significance (p<0.05), which means that results were not due to random chance.\n\nIn a study published this month, Harvard Medical School scientists searched for cases of Covid-19-related skin symptoms in the American Academy of Dermatology and International League of Dermatological Societies databases. They identified 171 such cases from 31 countries. While most skin symptoms lasted less than a month, pernio, chilblains, or redness and swelling of feet or hands\u2014also known as Covid-19 toes \u2014 persisted more than 60 days in six cases and more than 130 days in two cases.\n\nAlthough rare, science has recently described new and unique aspects of long-Covid ranging from symptoms of the heart, brain, peripheral nervous system, ear, and skin.\n\nPossible treatments\n\nAt this point, the guidelines for Covid-19 long-haulers include proper sleep, nutrition, and mental health management. Slow and gradual pacing of physical activities is also recommended but should be avoided if symptoms worsen.\n\nAccording to an unpublished study of 1,600 Covid-19 long-haulers, the self-reported supplements that helped with symptom relieve were vitamin D (500 people), vitamin C (290), zinc (250), magnesium (259), B12 (228), multivitamins (184), turmeric (156), N-acetylcysteine (134), and others. While these are anecdotes, they make sense since proper nutrition is advice for long-Covid recovery. Self-reported prescriptions were heartburn or acid reflux medications (230 people), steroids (221), antihistamines (215), inhalers (196), aspirin (80), ibuprofen (74), and others.\n\n\u201cRintatolimod is the only drug to have completed successful advanced placebo-controlled clinical trials (Phase II/III) for ME/CFS and is approved for severe ME/CFS in Argentina.\u201d\n\nLong-Covid is a syndrome similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Presently, there are no approved treatments for ME/CFS, but that may soon change. A phase III clinical trial of 75 sufferers of ME/CFS for 2\u20138 years was published a few days ago. And results found that an immunomodulatory called rintatolimod improved the exercise duration of 51% of patients. In contrast, only 17.6% of the placebo group saw improvement. That is nearly a tripled efficacy in terms of the number of responders.\n\n\u201cRintatolimod is the only drug to have completed successful advanced placebo-controlled clinical trials (Phase II/III) for ME/CFS and is approved for severe ME/CFS in Argentina,\u201d the authors wrote, which may apply to long-Covid as well. \u201cCovid-19 debilitated patients with \u201clong hauler\u201d post-viral syndrome would benefit from rintatolimod are topics for further investigation.\u201d Rintatolimod is now being investigated for its antiviral potential against Covid-19 in Japan.",

        "title": "Custom Maps on react-native-maps And react-google-maps",
        "text": "Read the original article on Sicara\u2019s website here.\n\nI recently worked on a React-Native mobile project that shows administrative divisions of countries in a colour depending on its crime rate. I found that many countries and cities provide freely their Geographical Data generated with specialized softwares known as GIS. Digging into data.gouv.fr, the french Open Data website, I bumped into a shapefile describing the french administrative divisions.\n\nHere\u2019s what I learnt that will save you some trial and error time.\n\nWhat I worked with to render a map easily\n\nI had to show both a map on a mobile and web app. As we developed the mobile app using React Native, we used the airbnb\u2019s component react-native-maps which revealed itself both simple to use and efficient. Here is a sample of a working React Native map component that draws polygons.\n\nimport MapView from 'react-native-maps'; export default function Map(props) {\n\nrender() {\n\nreturn (\n\n<MapView>\n\n{this.state.polygons.map(polygon =>\n\n(<MapView.Polygon\n\nkey={polygon.id}\n\ncoordinates={polygon.coordinates}\n\nfillColor='red'\n\nstrokeColor='black'\n\n/>),\n\n)}\n\n</MapView>\n\n);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nRegarding the React web app, we inserted Google maps using the react-google-maps module. Here are few lines to generate a Google map.\n\nimport React from 'react';\n\nimport { GoogleMapLoader, GoogleMap, Polygon } from 'react-google-maps'; export default function Map(props) {\n\nreturn (\n\n<GoogleMapLoader\n\ncontainerElement={\n\n<div\n\nstyle={{\n\nheight: '400px',\n\n}}\n\n{...props.containerProps}\n\n/>\n\n}\n\ngoogleMapElement={\n\n<GoogleMap>\n\n{props.polygons.map((polygon, index) => {\n\nreturn (\n\n<Polygon\n\nkey={index}\n\npaths={polygon.coordinates}\n\noptions={{\n\nstrokeWeight: 1,\n\nfillColor: 'red',\n\nfillOpacity: 1,\n\nstrokeColor: 'black',\n\n}}\n\n/>\n\n);\n\n})}\n\n</GoogleMap>\n\n}\n\n/>\n\n);\n\n}\n\nNew York boroughs drawn using react-google-maps (from the app SafeAround)\n\nWhat is a shapefile?\n\nShapefile is a commonly used data format, mostly generated by free geographical softwares (known as GIS). ShapeFiles are actually not single files but a collection of many different ones, including generally:\n\n.shp : gathers the coordinates of each polygons\n\n: gathers the coordinates of each polygons .dbf : information about the shapes (name, area, \u2026)\n\n: information about the shapes (name, area, \u2026) .prj : describes the projection used (usually, coordinates are not provided using longitude - latitude)\n\n: describes the used (usually, coordinates are not provided using longitude - latitude) .shx : provides an index over shapes to find neighboring shapes\n\n: provides an index over shapes to find neighboring shapes .cpg : text encoding used (UTF-8, Latin-1, us-ascii \u2026)\n\nHow can I read shapefiles using python?\n\nYou need only two libraries : pyshp and dbfread . You can print the data you have using\n\nimport shapefile as shp\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as p shp_file_path = \u2018MyShapeFile.shp\u2019\n\nmy_shapes = shp.Reader(shp_file_path).shapes()\n\nmy_shapes_list = list(map(lambda shape: shape.points, my_shapes))\n\nprint('Number of shapes : %s' % len(my_shapes_list)) for shape in my_shapes_list:\n\nlongitude, latitude = zip(*shape)\n\np.plot(longitude, latitude)\n\np.show()\n\nFor example, printing the USA counties boundaries:\n\nYou can then link each shape from the .shp to its metadata provided in the .dbf using the following code. The metadata in the .dbf are listed in the same order as their associated polygons in the .shp file.\n\nfrom dbfread import DBF\n\n\n\ndbf_file_path = 'usaCountiesShapeFile.dbf'\n\ncounties_information_list = DBF(dbf_file_path, load=True, encoding='utf-8').records\n\nprint('first county : %s' % counties_information_list[0])\n\nWhy do English coordinates not look like lat/long ?\n\nThe standard latitude-longitude coordinates format is called WGS84 (World Geodetic System, created in 1984).\n\nHowever, you might encounter strange coordinates used in your ShapeFile. Even worse, most projections used are not a linear transformation of the longitude-latitude format!\n\nFor example, you can find London wards here, but coordinates are provided using the British National Grid projection : they look like (530000, 180000).\n\nDon\u2019t panic, The GitHub user profLewis provides a python function to help! It converts British National Grid projection (OSGB36) to longitude-latitude coordinates (known as WGS84).\n\nSame thing goes for French coordinates: the administrative sections \u2018Iris\u2019 are provided on data.gouv.fr using Lambert93, the official projection in Metropolitan France. Find here a python function to transform Lambert93 coordinates to WGS84.\n\nThe United States\u2019 system, GCS_North_American_1983, is a tricky one as it differs from WGS84 by about a meter.\n\nWhere can I find the data?\n\nHere are some links to the data I used!\n\nLatitude-Longitude :\n\nBritish National Grid :\n\nFrance\u2019s Lambert93 :\n\nIf you look for other data, many countries have their own Open Data platform and provide geographical subdivisions! Opendatasoft.com listed 2600+ Open Data sources which you can explore in a map.",

        "title": "It\u2019s Like a Leaf, But Better",
        "text": "The field of chemistry has already had prior success in engineering artificial photosynthetic systems that can be used in tandem with carbon capture technology to turn carbon dioxide into usable fuels.\n\nThe first photosynthetic biohybrid system was produced in 2015. The system developed at UC Berkeley used semiconductors and live bacteria to produce a photosynthetic reaction that would use solar energy to produce liquid fuels using carbon dioxide and water. At the time, it was predicted that if the technology improved, it may become the future of energy. The process involves catalysts harvesting solar energy to generate charge which is then transferred to bacteria. The bacteria use the electric charge from the catalysts to instigate a chemical reduction reaction that turns carbon dioxide into liquid fuel. Butanol, acetate, polymers, and pharmaceutical precursors were produced as a result of this experiment. Furthermore, it was found that this first artificial photosynthetic system had a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.38%, which is comparable to the efficiency of a natural leaf.\n\nThe innovation didn\u2019t stop there though.\n\nA year later at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, the chemical transformation of carbon dioxide into fuels was achieved using metal-nitride nanowires as a catalyst to overcome the eventual efficiency bottleneck that can occur when using conventional photocatalytic technologies. While the typical conversion process of carbon dioxide into fuel requires high temperatures, high pressures, and/or extremely reactive reagents, the metal-nitride nanowire photocatalyst developed allows the process to be completed more stably and efficiently, while also occurring at room temperature. The result: solar fuels generated using an efficient artificial photosynthetic system that can be used to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, bringing society closer to a net-zero future.\n\nUC Berkeley and McGill University aren\u2019t alone in developing this groundbreaking technology. Just a few years later, another breakthrough came in the world of artificial photosynthetic systems.\n\nIn a 2019 report published in the American Chemical Society journal of Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, the solar-to-fuel efficiency of an artificial photosynthetic (AP) system was evaluated. The study looked directly at how the AP system can capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and can then convert it into fuel using sunlight. The report concludes that a modern, fully integrated AP system could reduce the carbon dioxide levels in the surrounding air by 10% during steady-state operation, which makes it fourteen times more efficient than natural leaves.\n\nThis report was analyzing a study conducted by the Department of Chemical Engineering from the University of Illinois, who had successfully produced fuels using water, visible light, and carbon dioxide using artificial photosynthesis. Scientists conducting the study developed an artificial photosynthesis process that used the same visible green light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum used by plants during natural photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide and water into fuel. The process used a plasmonic excitation of gold nanoparticles (used as a catalyst) to produce a rich, electrically-charged environment at the gold particle-carbon dioxide solution interface which is conducive to carbon dioxide activation. From there, an ionic liquid stabilizes the charged intermediates that formed on the surface of the interface which begins to facilitate a multi-step chemical reduction reaction coupled with carbon coupling. Multi-carbon chains can be produced, resulting in the formation of methane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, and propene.\n\nThe University of Illinois chemists who conducted the study wanted to focus on creating liquid fuels because they are easier, safer, and more economical to store and transport than regular gasoline. Furthermore, liquid fuels are comprised of long-chain molecules containing more bonds than regular gasoline, giving them a higher energy density. While the goal of the study was to learn how to use catalysts to increase the efficiency of the chemical reactions undergone during the carbon dioxide-to-fuel conversion experiment, the chemists of the study agree that the hard work will begin when they start determining how they can scale up the process.",

        "text": "Data Science Reading List for May 2020\n\nThis month\u2019s Data Science reading list.\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with any of the authors in this article. These are simply books that I\u2019m excited to share with you. There are no referrals or a cent going in my pocket from the authors or publishers mentioned. Enjoy!\n\nWelcome to this month\u2019s reading list!\n\nI wanted to add some fiction in here to make an important point. I\u2019ve noticed myself and lot of tech and data friends struggling to disconnect between work and other aspects of life. This change to remote work has been a shock for many of us. Working at a desk 10 feet from where you sleep, 10 feet from where you cook meals, and 10 feet from where you brush your teeth can be a real shock.\n\nOnce quitting time rolls around it\u2019s usually pretty healthy to completely disconnect from work. If you let work leak into every aspect of your life your work will quickly become your identity. While we as Data Science folks tend to be especially passionate about our work, there comes a time when it\u2019s necessary to completely disconnect. We need to always take time to interface with our creative side. And you might be surprised, when you start taking more time away from your work, your focused work becomes higher quality.\n\nAll this to say, don\u2019t read too many business and technical books in your free time. If you\u2019re only going to read one type of book \u2014 make it fiction! Read something fun. Engage your creative side. Whatever genre suits you, re-explore it. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nOn to the list!\n\nDesigning Data-Intensive Applications\n\nThis is a terrific read for the Data Engineers and Software Engineers among us.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a ton of system thinking on the Data Science side. I would say pick this one up if you\u2019re interested in learning more about how the data systems you use every day work.\n\nLINK\n\nSpringer Released 65 Technical Books For Free\n\nMost people have had this link shoved in their face already\u2026 But in case you haven\u2019t!\n\nSpringer released 65 Statistics, ML, etc books for free a few weeks ago. It\u2019s an awesome move on their part. So if you are looking for a particular reference book this is a great list to check before going out and making a purchase\u2026\n\nLINK\n\nMonetizing Innovation\n\nHad this one recommended to me by a fellow founder. He had another founder recommend it to him who said his business\u2019s pricing model was largely influenced by this book.\n\nI\u2019m all about practicality when it comes to business books so I had to check it out. So far it\u2019s lived up to my expectations. 225 pages of mostly value. Lots of diagrams and data-driven explanations for various pricing and product decisions. LINK\n\nDune\n\nDune is a book I\u2019ve had recommended to me more times than I can recall. Hopefully it lives up to the hype. From family who read it decades ago to friends who read it recently, I\u2019ve had it recommended time and time again. Started it last week.\n\nRead more fiction, people! And recommend me some fiction to read as well; I\u2019ve fallen away from fiction in favor of business and technical books which is a shame. Let\u2019s unlock our creative side and read more fiction!

        "text": "Augmenting the Images\n\nNow we can finally get started with the image augmentation. We will use PIL\u2019s ImageEnhance method for this.\n\nImageEnhance\u2019s Contrast() , Brightness() , Sharpness() , and Color() all load the image; then, we can use their enhance() methods to enhance those properties by any factor we choose. We will use np.linspace to choose factors between 0 and 1.5, and np.random.choice to randomize those factors.\n\nThe one-liner for doing this for contrast is:\n\ncontrast = [np.asarray(ImageEnhance.Contrast(Image.fromarray(img, 'RGB')).enhance(np.random.choice(np.linspace(0.5, 1.5, 5)))) for img in orig]\n\nFor each img in orig , we first load the image from the img array (specifying the color channel as \u201cRGB\u201d. Then, enhance the contrast by a random value from [0, 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5] ( np.linspace(0.5, 1.5, 5) will choose five linearly spaced values between 0 and 1.5). Finally, we save this image as an array within the contrast list.\n\nLet us see how the images look with their contrast tweaked:\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(9,9))\n\ni = 0\n\nfor img in contrast[0:16]:\n\nplt.subplot(4, 4, i+1)\n\nplt.xticks([])\n\nplt.yticks([])\n\nplt.grid(False)\n\nplt.imshow(img)\n\ni += 1\n\nplt.show()\n\nContrast tweaked by a factor of 0.5 to 1.5\n\nImages with an enhancement factor < 1 look greyer, while those with a factor > 1 are more saturated. Those with a factor = 1 won\u2019t be any different from the original.\n\nTo amplify the effect of randomness, we sequentially process the images for brightness, sharpness, and color, i.e., the output of one is the input of the other:\n\nbrightness = [np.asarray(ImageEnhance.Contrast(Image.fromarray(img, 'RGB')).enhance(np.random.choice(np.linspace(0.5, 1.5, 5)))) for img in contrast] sharpness = [np.asarray(ImageEnhance.Contrast(Image.fromarray(img, 'RGB')).enhance(np.random.choice(np.linspace(0.5, 1.5, 5)))) for img in brightness] color = [np.asarray(ImageEnhance.Contrast(Image.fromarray(img, 'RGB')).enhance(np.random.choice(np.linspace(0.5, 1.5, 5)))) for img in sharpness]\n\nAfter all these operations, the images look like:\n\nAfter tweaking brightness, sharpness, and color\n\nWe are just left with two more operations \u2014 flip and rotate.\n\nFor flip, we will use cv2.flip() . It takes the image and a value between 0, 1 and -1. For 0, it flips vertically; for 1, it flips horizontally; and for -1, it flips both horizontally and vertically. We can randomize these values to randomize the flip, and we can also randomize choosing if the image will be flipped or not. The one-liner for this is:\n\nflip = [cv2.flip(img, np.random.choice([0, 1, -1])) if np.random.choice([0, 1]) else img for img in color]\n\nIf np.random.choice([0, 1]) is 0, we don\u2019t flip and return the input; otherwise, we flip depending on np.random.choice([0, 1, -1]) .\n\nRotating is straightforward. We load the image from the image array and rotate it by as many degrees as we want. To avoid having to fill, we\u2019ll be randomly rotating the images by 0 (no rotation), 90, 180, or 270 degrees:\n\nrotate = [Image.fromarray(img, 'RGB').rotate(np.random.choice([0, 90, 180, 270])) for img in flip]\n\nThe final output after all these operations (along with the original images) looks like:\n\nWe can then save these images in a separate \u201caugmented\u201d folder:\n\nimport os\n\nfor i, image in tqdm(enumerate(rotate)):\n\ndirectory = paths[i].rsplit('/', 3)[0] + '/augmented/' + paths[i].rsplit('/', 2)[1]+ '/'\n\nos.makedirs(directory, exist_ok = True)\n\nimage.save(directory + paths[i].rsplit('/', 2)[2])\n\nIn addition to the steps we discussed, you can also add noise and blur to your image as a part of augmentation. These are described in my article on generating text CAPTCHAs in Python:",

        "text": "How AI Could Have Prevented the \u201cGreat Google Outage\u201d\n\nThe Black Mirror-esque Google outage.\n\nStill from Black Mirror.\n\nGoogle went down for millions, if not billions of people on December 14th, 2020. Using a Chromebook, I was locked out of my laptop, and couldn\u2019t access any Google services on my phone. In attempts to recover my accounts, I was told that none of my Google accounts existed.\n\nAs it turns out, the Great Google Outage impacted many countries.\n\nFor many, this was a wake-up call to how dependent we are on Google. Without access to the Internet, it feels like that Black Mirror episode where people can be locked out of society at the click of a button.\n\nWhy Outages Happen\n\nOutages are nothing new \u2014 it\u2019s just surprising when it happens to a behemoth like Google.\n\nThat said, Google suffered a 5-minute outage back in 2013, causing Internet traffic to drop by 40%. Most of the outage was solved in just 1 minute. Before then, one of the last outages was in 2009.\n\nThere are many potential causes of outages, including:\n\nServer power supply failures.\n\nHardware problems like overheating.\n\nExternal actions like malware.\n\nHow AI Can Prevent Outages\n\nGoogle is an enormous network, with literally millions of servers around the world. It\u2019d be impossible to have manual oversight into the status of these servers. At that scale, automation is needed to predict outages and monitor server status.\n\nMachine learning is great at finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. Given historical server performance data, including a column on outages, you could train a machine learning model to predict outages, allowing companies to reduce maintenance costs and prevent these catastrophes.\n\nWith automated machine learning tools like Obviously.AI, companies can build and deploy AI systems in minutes, rather than the months it would traditionally take.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Great Outage could indeed be used by Google as \u201ctraining data\u201d to make predictive AI models more accurate. AI finds patterns in data, and with more historical data to look back on, it can more accurately find patterns.\n\nBinary Classification\n\nThis is an example of a binary classification task in machine learning, as you\u2019re predicting a binary outcome: Server live, or server down.\n\nThis has been commonly used for tasks like predicting power grid outages, and the same concept applies to servers.\n\nPotentially predictive data attributes include processor usage, memory usage, disk read/write, latency, throughput, network bandwidth, and more.",

        "title": "Tips for Startups From Peter Thiel",
        "text": "Tips for Startups From Peter Thiel\n\n5 notable pieces of Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future\n\nI recently decided to read the popular book by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters titled, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future. While reading, I took some notes that I felt were important and needed to be shared.\n\nAll quotes are taken straight from the book Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future.\n\n1. Every Moment in Business Happens Only Once\n\nThe next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin will won\u2019t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg wont create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren\u2019t learning from them.\n\nEntrepreneurs and founders need to be different and create new things. The most successful entrepreneurs in the world had a new idea that the world needed even if people did not know they needed it. The most important part about this idea was that it was something new.\n\nWhat we should learn from the already successful founders mentioned above is that we should be discovering and creating new things to change the world. While it is easier to reinvent the wheel, creating a new method or significantly modifying the original method for the better is a much more lucrative and beneficial option for startups. Focus on creating new things that people may not know they want or need.\n\nThese new technologies or ideas mixed with a startup also have the potential to reach the point of becoming a monopoly (discussed later), which if handled properly, will lead to extreme success.\n\n2. Teamwork is Necessary for Startups\n\nSmall groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better\u2026 It\u2019s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it\u2019s even harder to do it by yourself.\n\nHaving a solid like-minded team willing to put in the work to achieve a shared goal is essential to any startup, especially a startup in the early stages. No matter how much weight entrepreneurs want to believe they can carry on their own, it is still true that two brains are better than one. Peter Thiel wrote in his book, \u201cit\u2019s very hard to go from 0 to 1 without a team\u201d.\n\nThat being said, the types of people who inhabit your team are very important. You cannot work with just anyone. This team, especially in the foundational stage, must consist of trustworthy people who all work well together towards a mutual goal.\n\n3. Build a Strong Foundation in the Beginning\n\nA startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.\n\nA building with a weak base is doomed to crumble. Like most things, the same goes for startups: a startup with a weak base is doomed to collapse. Founders and entrepreneurs need to be very careful during the early stages of their startups because the wrong decision can ruin the company\u2019s foundation and lead to failure.\n\nAs a founder, your first job is to get the first things right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation.\n\nOne of the most important foundational steps for all founders is choosing who to begin building the company with. This includes choosing co-founders, board members and employees. As mentioned earlier, teamwork is essential to a startup\u2019s success.\n\nTrouble between founders will never end well for the company. Peter Thiel recommends that co-founders know each other prior to starting the company and get along well together. Otherwise, differences between them could cause unwanted and fatal damage to the startup.\n\nThe book also mentions that a company\u2019s board should be kept small, such as around three members. Too big of a board and vital communication can be lost. Too small of a board and the board members could exercise their power and cause conflict.\n\nThe beginning stages of any company are the most important. This was stressed throughout the book. A successful company will get a strong foundation secured before building up into the windy and often chaotic world of business.\n\n4. Build a Monopoly\n\nAll happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape the competition.\n\nWhen I read this, I did not see it as a suggestion. Instead, I took it as a rule of the startup world. To reach the most success possible, a startup must position itself as a monopoly.\n\nStartups should aim for ruling a niche market with as few competitors as possible (preferably none), then progress and expand out from there. It is better to rule a niche market than to compete in a company-saturated market.\n\nGoing along with this theme of creating a monopoly, Peter Thiel also mentions how monopolistic companies should act and present themselves: by denying their monopolistic traits, and appearing to be in a competitive market.\n\nNon-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets. Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several larger markets.\n\nOnce a company is a monopoly, it is better to not present itself as one to avoid any negative attention.\n\n5. Avoid Competition\n\nIf you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you\u2019re already more sane than most.\n\nGoing along with the idea of creating a monopoly, founders should not aim to flood a vibrant competitive market, but should instead focus on finding a niche market with little to no competition. Not only could this lead to a monopolistic startup, but it takes the focus away from the competitors and places it on the customers, product(s) and the ultimate goal of the startup.\n\nCompetition creates a war, and war is destructive and never has a true winner. As Peter Thiel put it, \u201cwar is a costly business\u201d and it is simply not worth the stress and time for startups to focus on it. Instead, avoid the war and adversaries and focus on the inner workings of the startup itself.",

        "title": "Robots, AI and augmented stupidity: Interview with Andra Keay",
        "text": "Andra Keay is the Managing Director of Silicon Valley Robotics \u2014 a not-for-profit coalition of robotics companies and startups supporting the innovation and commercialisation of robotics technologies. She advises a number of startups and is the founder of Robot Launch Pad \u2014 organising events bridging startup and robotics communities.\n\nWe caught up with Andra to chat about the future of robotics and how entrepreneurs in the field can ensure innovation remains beneficial to human beings.\n\nHow did you get into robotics?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in all the geeky things since I was a child. Both my parents encouraged that a lot; their roles at universities meant that I got to play with computers and rockets and build equipment at a really early age.\n\n\u201cBut one of the things that happened all the time, was that people would express their astonishment that a girl was interested in things like rockets and robots. And after a while, that astonishment became more interesting than the things that I was doing.\n\nAndra and her brother as children\n\n\u201cI studied theories of communication and what I would like to call human-robot culture, as opposed to human-robot interaction. Where human-robot interaction focuses on the psychological side of things, and it\u2019s certainly a fascinating field, I realised that the one-to-one relationships are nowhere near as indicative of what\u2019s happening in society as understanding the broader social shifts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a discipline as it were, but we have to ask ourselves (and this is the question that fascinates me): what is the 21st century going to look like as the most cutting edge technologies trickle their way through to mainstream adoption?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what the adoption of technology looked like in the 20th century and that\u2019s not simply the internet or even computing; it\u2019s technologies like the automobile and household appliances.\n\n\u201cIf we look to history, we can see a lot of great examples of what happens when a really disruptive technology is adopted. It\u2019s not an immediate thing \u2014 as Roy Amara said, we often vastly overestimate the impact of technology in the short term but vastly underestimate the impact in the long term.\n\n\u201cWe fill the headlines with fear about robots and AI in the short term, but it\u2019s probably longer term structural shifts in society that are really where both the potential for problems and the potential for great advances are.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s clear, is that to solve a lot of the world\u2019s serious problems (the ageing population, the increasing population and the fact that we need to double food production without having the ability to increase the amount of land that we use), we are probably dependent on technology because we haven\u2019t been able to fix those problems yet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really hit a saturation point. The ability to increase our productivity without using more manual labour; we\u2019ve hit a saturation point there. We\u2019re dependent on technologies now to increase productivity. We need to be in the upward spiral or we\u2019ll be in a downward spiral; there isn\u2019t really a static place where we can just exist comfortably.\n\n\u201cOne of the grandfathers of AI, Norbert Wiener, said that the future is not a comfortable hammock for us to lie back in and be waited upon by robot slaves; it\u2019s actually an ever more challenging fight against the limitations of human intelligence. That\u2019s really at the heart of my interest in robotics and AI. These are technologies that humans have developed and we developed them with our own strengths and weaknesses wrapped up in them.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve spoken before about this tendency of technology to unconsciously reinforce stereotypes. How do we prevent this?\n\n\u201cWell perhaps one of the first steps is awareness. That\u2019s often an empty goal, because awareness without action is nothing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in the heart of the technologist scene, as it were, for a long time and I\u2019ve seen that the majority of the people involved don\u2019t believe that they are building technologies that are biased. We really need to lift the debate so that we can talk about the various ways in which unconscious biases, and indeed conscious biases, are replicated.\n\n\u201cIf anything, I think the current debate about Facebook and Twitter perpetuating hate speech is one of the strongest messages that we can get. It\u2019s starting to shift a bit of the tone, from the Silicon Valley attitude of \u2018we just build it, and it\u2019s not our fault\u2019 to thinking, actually, what we\u2019ve built is something that we need to be responsible for.\n\n\u201cThe problem with trying to change technologies that are widespread in the world is very clearly laid out. If it is a public company, then you have a legal obligation to report to the stockholders who have a very short term interest based on financial returns on a quarterly basis. If you said \u2018let\u2019s reduce our advertising revenue so we can reshape who we answer to\u2019, that\u2019s not going to fly. Whereas companies that are not yet public, or companies potentially like Facebook or Google who have majority control by the founders, maybe they can still go against that shortsighted direction.\n\n\u201cThese are not so much problems with technologies but problems with the financial structures that support them. And that\u2019s a lot to change. I do think that maybe it\u2019s a problem of scale \u2014 we can create really good technologies that are fantastic on a small scale but that become inherently problematic once they become large scale. That said, one of the one of the things I believe is that if we can invent the problem, we can invent the solution.\u201d\n\nWhat are your biggest fears about the future of robotics?\n\n\u201cI think that we won\u2019t end up with the really dysfunctional scenarios that people like to get scared about, like AI taking over the world or robots hurting us. Those things won\u2019t happen, but I think the stupid short term problems definitely will. We\u2019ve seen it happen where AI creates feedback loops that work on stupid things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen financial trading for example, that causes billion dollar losses rather than smaller, individual losses. The feedback loop gets exaggerated and the trades happen faster with automation and we end up losing billions of dollars. We\u2019ll see more of that kind of augmentation of human stupidity because AI and robotics allow us to augment human ability, and human ability can be stupid.\n\n\u201cWe can also augment human bias. It\u2019s in the field of gender that I see the most obvious problems happening. For example, an artificial intelligence like Microsoft Tay can get trained to hate speech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in video games where the representation of women is highly objectified, sexualised and stereotyped. Well I think with robots, because we won\u2019t want to see such sexualisation, it\u2019s going to be a little more subtle, but we\u2019ve already seen that the female-looking robots and female-voiced robots are being used for the most menial of tasks. They\u2019re very supportive, and it\u2019s very difficult at a time of #MeToo, at a time where women are standing up and saying \u2018I\u2019ve just discovered that I\u2019m not being paid as much as my males peers and I\u2019m supposed to be at the top of my field so I\u2019m going to fight\u2019 and yet we\u2019re building technologies to pass on the message that the woman\u2019s role is not to be assertive, but to be compliant.\u201d\n\nCan you tell us a bit more about this notion of augmented stupidity and bias?\n\n\u201cOne example is of AI being used to ascertain benefit status for health benefits. There is potential during construction of any system for conflict of goals i.e. best benefits vs lowest costs. The hardest thing about augmented stupidity is to find out who is at fault.\n\n\u201cWe also have a problem with transparency in AI and in automation generally. Developers blame designers and designers blame commissioners, who blame the rollout and then everybody blames the person on the other end and says \u2018well, they probably weren\u2019t eligible for health care\u2019. But its been found that people were being denied health care that they were legally clearly eligible for by systems that were skipping a few steps. Nobody took responsibility for checking this or working out what steps were being skipped.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most obvious examples of the power imbalance perpetuating augmented stupidity. The onus is put on the individual to complain and say they don\u2019t think this result is correct, and no one is auditing it.\n\n\u201cTo me, the two underlying problems with augmented stupidity \u2014 and the fact that it is, undoubtedly, rolling out everywhere \u2014 are that we are not putting effort into auditing and we\u2019re not building and using transparent modules.\n\n\u201cMuch of our AI and robotics is being done using off the shelf components. We\u2019re using computer vision libraries that are not developed in house, we\u2019re using software bridges that are maybe open source and maybe commercial but they\u2019re not developed in house, we\u2019re using navigation packages, mobile bases, sensors. There are a lot of things going into these systems and lot of trust that the system is going to do what we think it\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\nWhat are you most excited for in the future of robotics?\n\n\u201cWell founders, on the whole, are not really engaged with the idea of building something that is going to be auditable, accountable and make the world a better place. But right now there is a certain sort of founder who does congregate around the newest technologies of the world and is driven by the idea of doing things to make the world a better place and who will persevere in spite of of lack of funding and in spite of technical obstacles. I am privileged to be surrounded by people like that.\n\n\u201cThat makes me very optimistic and hopeful about the future. And then I look a few steps down the pathway and I think our follow up is to talk about developing good design guidelines and helping governments talk about developing requirements for accountability.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to be accountable for the diversity of the workforce. I believe having a diverse workforce would inherently shift some of these problems. First, you\u2019re developing the accountability framework and second, we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re maxing out all of the potential solutions that are available with the homogenous core group that we have in technology right now. If we have have a greater diversity in that group, we might have many more solutions on the table.\u201d\n\nWhat companies are you excited about at the moment?\n\n\u201cWillow Garage was an amazing open source research and development group in Silicon Valley. It was founded by a wealthy individual who was involved with Google and sold his own companies as well. He wanted to build the first personal household robot, and it turns out, of course, that\u2019s a really big problem to solve! So instead, he developed a framework \u2014 the first robotics platforms that could be used by multiple Universities because, at that point, robotics research did not have any standardisation.\n\n\u201cAt Willow Garage they created the open source Robot Operating System which is now used by pretty much 100% of robot startups. They also developed the the best experimental robot, the PR2, and also the lowest cost open source robotics hardware platform, Turtlebot.\n\n\u201cBut the key thing is that Willow Garage was a magnet for all of the talented robotics people in the world. It was fascinating because it was not a research centre, as such. While it was doing research and open publishing it, the goal was to develop things that were for commercialisation. While Willow Garage itself folded 2 or 3 years ago, it spun off 8 or 9 companies, and beyond that, almost all of the exciting robotics companies being developed in the Valley have people that worked at Willow Garage at the heart of them.\n\n\u201cWillow Garage has been a bit like Fairchild. It\u2019s well known how 80% of the technology companies in Silicon Valley are Fairchildren, and that includes the venture capital firms as well. Willow Garage has had a similar impact, and if I look for an exciting robotics company, it\u2019s almost 100% likely that someone from Willow Garage will be involved.\n\n\u201cOne company I\u2019m excited about is Mayfield Robotics who developed Kuri which is just being delivering to houses this year, having launched at CES in 2017. I have one in my living room right now! There\u2019s a really fast turnaround these days for robotics.\n\n\u201cYou also have Savioke that was founded by Steve Cousins and Fetch Robotics by Melonee Wise. Then there\u2019s Kinema Systems, and a number of companies that Google purchased. I could go on.\n\n\u201cThere are people who may not be the founders but are a part of the core team who worked at Willow Garage, and for me, this is a really good indicator that they come from the coolest group of roboticists out there \u2014 roboticists that have a sense of purpose as well, to make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nHow will robots integrate with our day to day lives over the next 5\u201310 years?\n\n\u201cI believe that robots train us just as much as we train robots, we work together, it\u2019s a very collaborative process. Anybody who\u2019s used voice commands or touch commands in their car, or on their tablets and phones will recognise that.\n\n\u201cIf we go into just about every bathroom (and I\u2019ve been travelling a lot, so I\u2019ve recognised that this is definitely worldwide), we expect to wave our hands to make things happen. I think it\u2019s fascinating that the bathroom is the space in which this is happening. We don\u2019t really talk about it much, but we\u2019re training ourselves in haptic interfaces.\n\n\u201cI think over the next 10 years, people are going to use haptic, gesture and voice commands and expect things to happen. For me, the question is, are we going to get that right or are we going to realise that there has to be a better way to control our devices and start to develop a new control technology?\n\n\u201cFor example, if we look down the track we might see something like an embedded or semi-embedded personal mic where we can tongue click our way through a menu. Or something that responds to our eyes, like AR or smart glasses or potentially in-home cameras that detect eye control with devices. Or perhaps we end up with a combination of the three things where you use a voice trigger or something to open a menu and then make selections from it by pointing and eye tracking where you point \u2014 the permutations go on!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be really interested to see what interface technologies we develop over the next 10 years. Everything in our house can be part of a robot house, and I expect that to include at least one mobile device, call it our home robot. I\u2019m hoping that we actually have a couple of robot arms in household use by then. I have seen people working on robots to do things like dishwashing and toilet cleaning and cooking and folding clothes. But it\u2019s always an open argument; is it better for us to build an appliance that is a one stop shop for cleaning and folding and hanging our clothes, or should we continue to have the appliances we have and have some form of robot arm that takes things out and folds them or puts them away? What\u2019s the most effective? We just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d like to say a huge thank you to Andra for speaking to us.

        "text": "The Problem with Billionaire Syndrome\n\nProblems arise when a person\u2019s desire to join the millionaire\u2019s club becomes directly proportional to their desire to disconnect from a beggar.\n\nLet me call in another Medium writer to illustrate this problem further, Jessica Wildfire:\n\n\u201cBillionaire syndrome happens when we start empathizing with the super-elite, and not the people they exploit. We let them teach us how to hate ourselves for being constantly broke. We crave to be more like them, so much that we fantasize about it. We make excuses for how they treat people. We learn to despise other people who don\u2019t have money. We call them lazy, or toxic \u2014 or both.\u201d\n\nBillionaire syndrome is a real dynamic in our society. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to believe you can be a billionaire than it is to believe you can change the system that caters to them,\u201d as Jessica explains it.\n\nThe beggar is here today, in our faces, as are our friends who are struggling to make ends meet. We could be working together to fix the social problems that make most of us so uncomfortable. But we are not. We are focused on trying to avoid becoming one of the \u201cunfortunate ones\u201d in the future.\n\nThis tells us a lot about our collective willingness to live in the present: it\u2019s non-existent. It\u2019s easier to believe you will not one day become a beggar than to empathize with the beggar and try to fight the inequalities that generate them.\n\nAnd here is a paradox, the more we try to escape the present by dreaming of an idealized future, the worst our collective future will become.\n\nAilton Krenak. Image source: Wikipedia.\n\nFrom the Outside Looking In\n\nThe title of this article, \u201cTomorrow is Not for Sale,\u201d is a direct translation of an article that was published earlier this year by Brazilian philosopher Ailton Krenak, who won the Intellectual of the Year Award in 2020 for his contribution to democracy.\n\nAilton is a Brazilian native Indian, who was forcibly separated from his tribe at age 9 and taken into our civilization. Since then he has been one of the most prominent leaders of the indigenous people\u2019s movement in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian native tribes are some of the last remaining people whose way of life we can compare to those taught by Jesus, Diogenes, or Buddha. We should pay attention to them since they offer an outsider look into our society and shine a light on our vices.\n\nAilton takes the occasion of the pandemic to remind us of our human condition, as an integral part of nature, susceptible to plagues, death, and extinction like any other species.\n\nHis original article is a humbling warning to us, what he calls the \u201cwhite men\u201d as opposed to native Indians. What we call humanity is for him nothing more than silly child play, as he observes it from the outside:\n\n\u201cIt is as if we had several children playing and, imagining this childhood fantasy, they continued to play indefinitely. But as we become adults, we [must realize that] we\u2019re devastating the planet, digging a huge gap of inequalities between peoples and societies.\u201d\n\nWe are so addicted to the money game that we lose sight of the essence of what it means to be human, alongside other human beings and nature. His call to action is urgent. We must end our arrogant, egotistical anthropocentrism if we are to survive as a species.\n\nIt\u2019s a message that rings close to Umair Haque\u2019s warning: by the middle of the century if our civilization is to survive, our society will need to undergo a great transformation:\n\n\u201cOur moral community [those that we care about] must include the fish who clean our rivers, the insects who turn our soil, the trees who give us air to breathe, the rivers that give us water to drink, the water that passes through us and becomes the rain and the river again. We must learn to care for them just as we care for our \u201cown.\u201d The time for petty human tribalisms is now past.\u201d",

        "text": "Infection | Brain\n\nRecovered Covid-19 Cases Still Show Brain Anomalies 3 Months Later\n\nFirst data that neurological signs and brain structural changes persist in Covid-19. But can the brain self-renew with time?\n\nImage by rawpixel.com\n\nScience knows that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can replicate in human neurons and brain organoids. Brain damage and neurological symptoms are also not rare in Covid-19 cases. Whether such brain insults are long-lasting, however, remains uncertain. And a new study published August in The Lancet, \u201cCerebral Micro-Structural Changes in COVID-19 Patients \u2014 An MRI-based 3-month Follow-up Study,\u201d that casts light on this topic.\n\nPersistent Neurological Symptoms\n\nIn this study, researchers at the Huashan Hospital in China recruited 60 Covid-19 patients that had recovered for over three months (mean age: 44.10; 56.7% males) and 39 non-Covid-19 controls (mean age: 45.88; 56.4% males). Both groups of participants were matched in terms of age, sex, and the prevalence of smoking, alcohol consumption, and underlying comorbidities.\n\nDuring Covid-19, over two-thirds of these 60 recovered Covid-19 patients had neurological symptoms. Other common Covid-19 signs were fever (88.33%), cough (56.67%), and gastrointestinal distress (13.33%). Treatments used were antivirals (96.67%), oxygen therapy (61.67%), antibiotics (35%), and interferons (15%). And 78.33% of them had mild, 20% had severe, and 1.67% had critical Covid-19.\n\nEven mild and not-so-old cases of Covid-19 may suffer compromised brain functions that are long-lasting.\n\nThree months later, over half (55%) of these patients still had neurological symptoms. Only the frequency of mood alterations and fatigue decreased significantly (blue asterisks) from 41.67% to 16.67% and 26.67% to 6.67%, respectively. Other neurological symptoms (see figure; such as headache, impaired mobility, numbness, myalgia, memory loss, etc.) persisted for over three months.\n\nAnd the fact that 78.33% of these patients initially had mild Covid-19 is also concerning as it means that persistent neurological symptoms can affect mild Covid-19 cases as well.\n\nBlue asterisks (p <0.05) indicate statistically significant changes that are due to chance. No blue asterisks (p > 0.05) mean changes are not statistically significant. Source: Lu et al. (2020). Cerebral Micro-Structural Changes in COVID-19 Patients \u2014 An MRI-based 3-month Follow-up Study. The Lancet.\n\nPersistent Brain Structural Changes\n\nNext, the researchers used two brain imaging techniques: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that captures cortical brain areas as a whole and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that detects microstructural brain changes. Results revealed that at three-month follow-up:\n\nCovid-19 patients had higher overall brain diffusivity and white matter volume \u2014 which further correlated negatively with memory loss \u2014 than non-Covid-19 controls.\n\nCovid-19 patients had greater grey matter volume (GMV) in the right cingulate, left Rolandic operculum, left Heschl\u2019s gyrus, hippocampus, and olfactory cortices \u2014 which further correlated negatively with memory and smell loss, fatigue, and numbness \u2014 compared to non-Covid-19 controls.\n\nAmong the structural brain changes, only cingulate gyrus correlated positively with Covid-19 severity during hospitalization. The cingulate gyrus is involved in attention, motivation, decision making, and learning. Put it another way; it also indicates that even mild Covid-19 cases may face persistent brain structural changes.\n\nNotably, all brain regions are examined except the brainstem due to technical limitations, which is unfortunate given that the brain\u2019s cardiorespiratory centre resides in the brainstem. Other study limitations, the authors admitted, were the small sample size and participants recruitment from one hospital only.\n\nOn the other side, the human brain displays a remarkable capacity to self-renew with time, such as following stroke or traumatic brain injury.\n\nNotwithstanding these caveats, this study showed that recovered Covid-19 patients had increased brain diffusivity and enlarged white and grey matter at three-month follow-up. These indicate the brain is undergoing heightened metabolic activities. Why? The academics posited that these are \u2018functional compensations\u2019 where the brain is trying to repair itself from the insults Covid-19 inflicted.\n\n\u201cIn this prospective study, volumetric and micro-structural abnormalities were detected mainly in the central olfactory cortices, partial white matter in the right hemisphere from recovered Covid-19 patients, providing new evidence to the neurological damage of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d the study authors concluded. \u201cThe abnormalities in these brain areas might cause long-term burden to Covid-19 patients after recovery, which was thus worth public attention.\u201d\n\nCan the Brain Self-renew?\n\nTo sum up, this August study in The Lancet showed, for the first time, persistent neurological symptoms and structural brain alterations in Covid-19 cases. Also, note that the majority of participants in this study were middle-aged (mean age of 44) and had mild Covid-19. It seems terrible news; even mild and not-so-old cases of Covid-19 may suffer long-lasting poor brain functions.\n\nOn the other side, the human brain displays a remarkable capacity to self-renew with time, such as following stroke or traumatic brain injury. \u201cAlthough the central nervous system (CNS) has been considered for years as a \u201cperennial\u201d tissue,\u201d explained neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt has recently become clear that both physiological and reparative regeneration occur also within the CNS to sustain tissue homeostasis and repair.\u201d Brain renewal is driven by neural stem cells in the hippocampus and subventricular zone that remain active for life, which catalyzes neurogenesis and neural outgrowth to other brain areas.\n\nEven the August study proposed \u2018functional compensation\u2019 at play in the brains of the recovered Covid-19 patients. Brain scans revealed increased metabolic activities and enlarged structures in those patients. Plus, those Covid-19 patients also showed less neurological symptoms at three-month follow-up. Perhaps, more time is simply needed for Covid-19 brain complications to pass.",

        "title": "When Nostalgia Backfires",
        "text": "When Nostalgia Backfires\n\nDoes reminiscing help us or hold us back?\n\nPhoto: Constance Bannister Corp/Getty Images\n\nThe sight of her husband baking bread has become all too familiar over the past six months to Sophia Yen, a California-based MD. He\u2019ll spend hours in the kitchen doing what has now become a family event, as their youngest daughter loves to join to pat and push the dough together. Meanwhile, the couple has taken a renewed interest in music they listened to when they were high school sweethearts, circa the mid-\u201980s. \u201cDepeche Mode, Take on Me by a-ha, and Michael Jackson! We also just recently watched live readings of The Princess Bride and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. It\u2019s so stressful right now and these activities [give us some relief],\u201d says Yen, who is the co-founder of a birth control delivery startup called Pandia Health. They harken back to the \u201cgood ol\u2019 days,\u201d she says.\n\nYen and her family aren\u2019t the only ones looking to the past for comfort right now. A study from KU Leuven, a university in Belgium, found a significant increase in nostalgic consumption of music on Spotify during shutdowns. Another study, from the University of Central Lancashire in the U.K., categorized the feeling of nostalgia as one of the wellness benefits of viewing nature via a webcam during a shutdown. A June 2020 paper from Clemson University strongly recommended people adopt nostalgia as a coping mechanism amidst the shutdown. The Clemson study went on to offer an array of nostalgia-based tips (or \u201cpaths\u201d) to battle the corona blues, such as replaying famous sporting events, classic films, and notable concerts from the past; playing traditional board games with friends and family; or baking bread and making fresh pasta together.\n\n\u201c[Nostalgia is] a reflection of a fairly stable, fairly knowable, and usually positive past, and that for a lot of people can help calm anxieties during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe modern definition of nostalgia is \u201ca sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.\u201d \u201cNostalgia has a palliative impact,\u201d says Gregory Ramshaw, PhD, associate professor at Clemson and co-author of the June paper. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of a fairly stable, fairly knowable, and usually positive past, and that for a lot of people can help calm anxieties during the pandemic, when we are kind of looking at a fairly bleak future economically and socially.\u201d Even long before the pandemic, science had already labeled nostalgia \u201ca deeply social emotion,\u201d something perhaps best experienced alongside others. \u201cMany of the family nostalgic paths, for example watching old films together, or collective nostalgic paths, like seeing the Queen come out to carry out her duties in Great Britain, encourage getting together \u2014 \u2018nostalgizing\u2019 together,\u201d says Ramshaw.\n\nBut the original meaning of nostalgia may be a bit less warm and fuzzy: The word comes from Greek words \u201cnostos,\u201d meaning return to one\u2019s homeland, and \u201calgos,\u201d meaning pain. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, nostalgia was actually considered a psychopathological disorder, with its sufferers being sent to the countryside to \u201cheal.\u201d\n\nIn modern times, too, dwelling on the past can hurt. In her practice, Noel Hunter, PsyD, clinical psychologist and author of Trauma and Madness in Mental Health Services, has observed that the majority of people struggling with the ongoing shutdown are people who are clinging to the past, wishing things would go back to normal and weren\u2019t what they are.\n\nThey try to cheer themselves up by remembering happier times of the past, which, Hunter says, can backfire. \u201cReminiscing turns to ruminating and generally just creates more misery as they blame themselves for setbacks and are not able to accept limitations. In doing so, they become angry, anxious, and depressed, with their brains literally fighting the present reality by trying to wish away what is,\u201d she says.\n\nThe antidote, Hunter says, is staying present: letting go of what we can\u2019t change and finding ways to bring joy, pleasure, meaning, and purpose to the here and now. This, of course, is the idea behind mindfulness, the act of being focused on the present moment. \u201cBuddhists have been telling us for millennia that focusing on the past or future too much can bring about great suffering,\u201d says Hunter.\n\nBut why are people like the ones Hunter is seeing in her practice experiencing negative effects that seem so counter to the body of research about nostalgia\u2019s benefits? It may be that they\u2019re not approaching the reminiscing with the right mindset.\n\n\u201cAn important component of nostalgia is that it doesn\u2019t just encourage individuals to reflect and remember a particular event, but that it also reminds them how they felt at the time, so tapping into how they felt when younger helps to remind them how to perceive the future more positively,\u201d says Sean Gammon, PhD, reader at the University of Central Lancashire and co-author of the June nostalgia study.\n\nFinding great pleasure in reminiscing and remembering fond times, but in balance, is not something Hunter is opposed to. \u201cThere is a reason why we keep pictures, videos, and mementos of past joys, and nostalgia in balance can be fruitful,\u201d she says.\n\nThe majority of people struggling with the ongoing shutdown are people who are clinging to the past, wishing things would go back to normal and weren\u2019t what they are.\n\nAnd remember, Hunter suggests, that we\u2019re creating memories now. \u201cRamshaw and Gammon\u2019s paper says we should consider whether we are now creating our own future nostalgia,\u201d she points out. That means we could eventually be grateful that we stayed present as best we could, and appreciated the best of what we have now, she says. \u201cHumans have lived for tens of thousands of years through much, much worse, and have survived,\u201d Hunter says.\n\nBack in California, Yen is juggling family life and career at home \u2014 it\u2019s stressful, she says, but her company is doing well. The shutdown has strained her, nonetheless. \u201cI may need to pitch an investor and all of a sudden my Zoom volume goes down or my video\u2019s not working, professionally embarrassing me and endangering my ability to get money for my company. And then a child may be screaming in the background,\u201d she says. Yet she isn\u2019t overly wistful about pre-pandemic times, either: \u201cI definitely wouldn\u2019t want us to return to the time when we had to pull an all nighter every single week at MIT with my husband; we do not want to do that! If anything, we want to go forward,\u201d she says.\n\nStill, experiencing nostalgia together with her family has proved to be a coping mechanism. They haven\u2019t turned back the clock; they have just flushed bleakness out of their life by selectively picking out the memories they associate with happiness. Her husband will continue baking bread, and the whole family will go on enjoying her favorite childhood movies. \u201cThere is no black and white. Just gray,\u201d Yen says while listening to a Cyndi Lauper song. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be nostalgic forever.\u201d",

        "text": "Use cProfile with snakeviz\n\nHere is a great combo for a more detailed analysis. I recommend using this for complex code, as it\u2019s great for finding potential performance bottlenecks.\n\ncProfile is a built-in C extension that gives you a set of statistics that describe how often and for how long various parts of the program are executed. This set of statistics is called a profile.\n\nsnakeviz is a third-party Python library used to visualize these statistics in the browser and interpret them in a more user-friendly fashion.\n\nIf you want precise timing of specific pieces of code, I would still recommend timeit, but for finding potential bottlenecks, this is the best option in my opinion.\n\nAccording to the docs:\n\n\u201cThe profiler modules are designed to provide an execution profile for a given program, not for benchmarking purposes (for that, there is timeit for reasonably accurate results). This particularly applies to benchmarking Python code against C code: the profilers introduce overhead for Python code, but not for C-level functions, and so the C code would seem faster than any Python one.\u201d\n\nNote: You need to install snakeviz first!\n\nRun this script. cProfile will dump results to a file named results.prof :\n\nUse snakeviz to view the results in the browser by running this command:\n\nsnakeviz results.prof\n\nFunction call stack (starting from top)\n\nStatistics (see https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/#interpreting-results for more info)\n\nJust from the first image, we can easily see that the bottleneck() function takes the longest to execute, so it could indicate a potential performance bottleneck. And you can also see the underlying sleep() function that causes it to run for so long.\n\nWe also get some additional statistics like the number of calls for each function in the call stack, which might be useful in detecting redundant calls that can also impact performance.\n\nFind out more about how to interpret results on GitHub.",

        "title": "Mapping Coronavirus with Python",
        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe coronavirus, called Covid-19 by the WHO, is continuing to spread around the world. As of April 28, 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 3.13 million people and killed at least 217,000 people worldwide. In this tutorial, we will learn how to map the virus spread using python libraries (Folium, Geopandas, Pandas, Numpy, hvplot, Matplotlib, kepler.gl) that can be helpful for data wrangling, and mapping COVID-19 data.\n\nData Source\n\nThere are a lot of COVID-19 datasets available such as Worldometer, Our World in Data (cumulative), and some other COVID-19 datasets from Google, Johns Hopkins University, European Union Open Data Portal. Worldometer provides up-to-date COVID-19 data[1]. Worldometer updates the total number of coronavirus COVID-19 cases on a daily basis. Our World in Data [2] provides a collection of the COVID-19 data together with a complete overview of data sources and more at this GitHub repository here. Let\u2019s start web scraping COVID-19 data using python.\n\nWeb Scraping\n\nWeb scraping is all about the process of gathering information from HTML. There are some useful python libraries for extracting data from websites as below:\n\n#import libraries\n\nimport os, sys\n\nimport json\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom numpy import int64\n\nimport requests, io\n\nimport urllib.request\n\nimport folium\n\nfrom folium import plugins\n\nimport fiona\n\nimport branca\n\nfrom branca.colormap import linear\n\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nLet\u2019s define the URL and get the data.\n\n\n\nresponse = requests.get(url) url = \u2018 https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries' response = requests.get(url)\n\nLet\u2019s check what we\u2019ve got.\n\ndata = response.content.decode(\u2018utf-8\u2019)\n\nWebsite Scraping\n\nIn order to clean the above messy data, we have to parse the content we get from the request. So, now we can define our HTML table parser object. I found there are some table parser functions available to get HTML table data. There is one table parser function I prefer to use as below:\n\nclass HTMLTableParser:\n\n\n\ndef parse_url(self, url):\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, \u2018lxml\u2019)\n\nreturn [(table[\u2018id\u2019],self.parse_html_table(table))\\\n\nfor table in soup.find_all(\u2018table\u2019)]\n\n\n\ndef parse_html_table(self, table):\n\nn_columns = 0\n\nn_rows=0\n\ncolumn_names = []\n\n\n\n# Find number of rows and columns\n\n# we also find the column titles if we can\n\nfor row in table.find_all(\u2018tr\u2019):\n\n\n\n# Determine the number of rows in the table\n\ntd_tags = row.find_all(\u2018td\u2019)\n\nif len(td_tags) > 0:\n\nn_rows+=1\n\nif n_columns == 0:\n\n# Set the number of columns for our table\n\nn_columns = len(td_tags)\n\n\n\n# Handle column names if we find them\n\nth_tags = row.find_all(\u2018th\u2019)\n\nif len(th_tags) > 0 and len(column_names) == 0:\n\nfor th in th_tags:\n\ncolumn_names.append(th.get_text())\n\n\n\n# Safeguard on Column Titles\n\nif len(column_names) > 0 and len(column_names) != n_columns:\n\nraise Exception(\u201cColumn titles do not match the number of columns\u201d)\n\n\n\ncolumns = column_names if len(column_names) > 0 else range(0,n_columns)\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(columns = columns,\n\nindex= range(0,n_rows))\n\nrow_marker = 0\n\nfor row in table.find_all(\u2018tr\u2019):\n\ncolumn_marker = 0\n\ncolumns = row.find_all(\u2018td\u2019)\n\nfor column in columns:\n\ndf.iat[row_marker,column_marker] = column.get_text()\n\ncolumn_marker += 1\n\nif len(columns) > 0:\n\nrow_marker += 1\n\n\n\n# Convert to float if possible\n\nfor col in df:\n\ntry:\n\ndf[col] = df[col].astype(float)\n\nexcept ValueError:\n\npass\n\n\n\nreturn df\n\nNow let\u2019s try the above code to create a new data frame from the HTML table data.\n\nhp = HTMLTableParser()\n\ntable = hp.parse_url(url)[0][1] # Grabbing the table from the tuple\n\ntable.head(10)\n\nIf we run the above code, we can get the result as below:\n\nWe can see a few special characters (\u201c\n\n\u201d, \u201c+\u201d) to remove in the table. Let\u2019s check the dataframe.\n\n#check bottom rows\n\ntable.tail(10)\n\nThere are some extra special characters (\n\n..\n\n) in the dataframe. We need to remove the extra characters. We only need country data for mapping in this tutorial. So we can drop the extra top and bottom rows that we do not need for data processing.\n\n#Drop top buttom unwanted rows\n\ndf= table.drop(table.index[[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]]).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n#drop tail unwanted rows\n\ndf.drop(df.tail(8).index,inplace=True)\n\n#drop new line '\n\n' charachter\n\ndf.replace(['\n\n'], '', regex=True, inplace=True)\n\ndf.replace([','], '', regex=True, inplace=True)\n\nWe need to format the table before starting mapping. The special characters in the dataframe can be removed using a loop as below:\n\n# drop unwanted drop unwanted special characters using a loop\n\nfor col in df.columns[1:11]:\n\ndf[col]=df[col].str.replace(\u201c+\u201d, \u201c\u201d).str.replace(\u201c,\u201d, \u201c\u201d).str.replace(\u201cN/A\u201d, \u201c\u201d).str.replace(\u201c \u201c, \u201c\u201d).str.replace(\u201c \u201c, \u201c\u201d)\n\nAll the extracted data is in text format and some column names are improper for data processing. We need to rename some column names.\n\ndf1 = df.rename(columns={'Country,Other': 'CNTRY_NAME', 'Serious,Critical': 'Serious_Critical', 'Tot Cases/1M pop': 'Tot_Cases_1M_pop', 'Deaths/1M pop': 'Deaths_1M_pop', 'Tests/\n\n1M pop\n\n': 'Tests_1M_pop'})\n\nThe final result is as below:\n\nWorldometer Coronavirus Table\n\nHowever, it is still not enough for data processing. We need to check the data type of each data frame column.\n\nData Types\n\nThe data type of each column is object in the dataframe. So we need to convert some data types to appropriate data types in the data frame. Type conversion is the conversion of object from one data type to another data type.\n\n#convert object columns in dataframe to numeric\n\ndf1.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\ndf1.replace(np.nan, 0, inplace=True)\n\ndf1.replace(np.inf, 0, inplace=True)\n\nfor col in df1.columns[1:11]:\n\ndf1[col] = pd.to_numeric(df1[col], errors=\u2019ignore\u2019)\n\nLet\u2019s check it again:\n\nWe can see that most of the data types converted to numeric, but some of them are float due to some empty column values. So let\u2019s try again to convert them to integer data types. We can keep the float data type in the dataframe if it is in the correct data format.\n\n#convert float columns in data frame to integer\n\ndf1.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\ndf1.replace(np.nan, 0, inplace=True)\n\ndf1.replace(np.inf, 0, inplace=True)\n\nfor col in df1.columns[1:11]:\n\ndf1[col]=df1[col].apply(int)\n\nIt can be seen that web scraping is hard. We need to identify incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, or irrelevant parts of the data and then replace, modify, or remove coarse data in the data frame.\n\ndf1.sort_values(by=[\u2018TotalCases\u2019], inplace=True, ascending=False)\n\ndf1.head(10)\n\nCleaned Worldometer Table\n\nIt seems the data is clean and nicely formatted. Now let\u2019s start mapping.\n\nMapping\n\nMapping is creating graphic representations of information using spatial relationships within the graphic to represent some relationships within the data. It can be static or dynamic (includes animated and real-time web maps or interactive web maps). We need geospatial country data for mapping. The country dataset is freely available on ArcGIS Open Data Hub.\n\n\n\nurl = \"\n\nworld = gpd.read_file(url)\n\nworld.plot() # get country dataurl = \" https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a21fdb46d23e4ef896f31475217cbb08_1.geojson world = gpd.read_file(url)world.plot()\n\nCountries WGS84 (ArcGIS Hub)\n\nThere is another option of downloading country shapefile data as below:\n\nDownloading Zipped Shapefile\n\nSo far, we have prepared COVID-19 and country datasets for mapping. GeoPandas is an open-source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. There are two ways to combine datasets in geopandas \u2014 attribute joins and spatial joins. In an attribute join, merging is based on a common variable.\n\nLet\u2019s check the country data.\n\nIt has country names (CNTRY_NAME) and geometry for mapping. So there is a common column name in both data frames. However, CNTRY_NAME of the USA and UK are different (\u201cUnited States\u201d,\u201d United Kingdom\u201d )in the world data frame. So let\u2019s rename them before merging both data frames.\n\nworld.CNTRY_NAME = world.CNTRY_NAME.replace({\"United States\": \"USA\"},{\"United Kingdom\": \"UK\"})\n\nLet\u2019s merge two datasets based on the common column \u201cCNTRY_NAME\u201d. Let\u2019s check the data types of columns.\n\ncorona = world.merge(df1, on='CNTRY_NAME', how='left')\n\ncorona.dtypes\n\nThe data type of some columns are not in the correct format.\n\ncorona.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\ncorona.replace(np.nan, 0, inplace=True)\n\ncorona.replace(np.inf, 0, inplace=True)\n\nfor col in corona.columns[3:10]:\n\ncorona[col]=corona[col].astype(int)\n\ncorona.dtypes\n\nLet\u2019s create a new geopandas data frame by merging these two datasets.\n\ndf_world = pd.merge(df1, world, on=\u2019CNTRY_NAME\u2019)\n\ncrs = {\u2018init\u2019: \u2018epsg:4326\u2019}\n\ncorona_gpd = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df_world, crs=crs, geometry=\u2019geometry\u2019)\n\ncorona_gpd.head(5)\n\nPlotting Data\n\nGeopandas provides a high-level interface to the matplotlib library for making static maps. Mapping shapes is as easy as using the plot() method on a GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame.\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(12,8))\n\nax = corona_gpd.plot(column=\u2019TotalCases\u2019, cmap=\u2019rainbow\u2019, ax=ax, legend=True,\n\nlegend_kwds={\u2018label\u2019: \u201cTotal Cases by Country\u201d })\n\nax = corona_gpd.plot(figsize=(15, 15), column=\u2019TotalDeaths\u2019, cmap=plt.cm.jet, scheme=\u2019fisher_jenks\u2019, k=9, alpha=1, legend=True, markersize = 0.5 )\n\nplt.title(\u2018Coronavirus Total Death by Country\u2019)\n\nWe\u2019ll now start converting above static maps to interactive maps using hvplot .\n\nimport hvplot.pandas\n\ncorona_gpd.hvplot(c=\u201dTotalDeaths\u201d, cmap=\u2019rainbow\u2019,\n\nwidth=800,height=450,\n\ntitle=\u201dTotalDeaths by Country\u201d)\n\nInteractive Plotting\n\nLet\u2019s try to plot COVID-19 time-series data from Our World in Data.\n\n\n\ncovid= pd.read_csv('\n\ncovid1 = covid.rename(columns={'location': 'COUNTRY'})\n\ncovid_gdp = pd.merge(world, covid1)\n\ncrs = {'init': 'epsg:4326'}\n\ncovid_gdp = gpd.GeoDataFrame(covid_gdp, crs=crs, geometry='geometry')\n\ncovid_gdp.hvplot( c=\"total_deaths\",\n\ncmap=\"YlOrRd\",\n\nhover_cols=['COUNTRY', 'total_deaths'],\n\nhover_fill_color=\"grey\",\n\nline_width=2,\n\nwidth=800,\n\nheight=450,\n\ngroupby='date',\n\ntitle=\"Covid-19 Total Deaths by Country/Date\") # plotting time series datacovid= pd.read_csv(' https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv' , delimiter= \",\")covid1 = covid.rename(columns={'location': 'COUNTRY'})covid_gdp = pd.merge(world, covid1)crs = {'init': 'epsg:4326'}covid_gdp = gpd.GeoDataFrame(covid_gdp, crs=crs, geometry='geometry')covid_gdp.hvplot( c=\"total_deaths\",cmap=\"YlOrRd\",hover_cols=['COUNTRY', 'total_deaths'],hover_fill_color=\"grey\",line_width=2,width=800,height=450,groupby='date',title=\"Covid-19 Total Deaths by Country/Date\")\n\nCovid-19 Timeseries Data\n\nInteractive Mapping\n\nIt is very straightforward to add geometries (points, polygons, lines) from a GeoDataFrame to a map. This can be done using the additional python library Folium. It makes it easy to visualize data that\u2019s been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map. The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. Even Esri base maps can be added. Folium supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON, and TopoJSON overlays. For example:\n\nimport folium #OSM Map\n\nm = folium.Map(location=[43.6532, -79.3832])#Toronto\n\nm\n\nOSM Map\n\nEsri basemaps can also be added as below:\n\n\n\nzoom_start=12,\n\ntiles=\u2019\n\nattr=\u2019Ablajan or anything else...\u2019) folium.Map(location=[43.6532, -79.3832],zoom_start=12,tiles=\u2019 https://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/World_Topo_Map/MapServer/WMTS/tile/1.0.0/World_Topo_Map/default/default028mm/{z}/{y}/{x}.png' attr=\u2019Ablajan or anything else...\u2019)\n\nLet\u2019s add COVID-19 data to the above map.\n\n#load gdf to map\n\ngjson = corona_gpd.to_crs(epsg=\u20194326').to_json()\n\n#embed map\n\ndef embed_map(m):\n\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame\n\nm.save(\u2018index.html\u2019)\n\nreturn IFrame(\u2018index.html\u2019, width=\u2019100%\u2019, height=\u2019750px\u2019)\n\nmap = folium.Map([43.783333, -79.866667], zoom_start=2)\n\ncountry = folium.features.GeoJson(gjson)\n\nmap.add_child(country)\n\nembed_map(map)\n\nLet\u2019s try to add a choropleth map with tooltips.\n\n\n\ndef embed_map(m):\n\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame\n\nm.save('index.html')\n\nreturn IFrame('index.html', width='100%', height='500px')\n\n#add basemap\n\nmap = folium.Map([0, 0], zoom_start=2, tiles='\n\nattr='Esri ..., Ablajan or anything else...') # add iframe in notebookdef embed_map(m):from IPython.display import IFramem.save('index.html')return IFrame('index.html', width='100%', height='500px')#add basemapmap = folium.Map([0, 0], zoom_start=2, tiles=' https://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/World_Topo_Map/MapServer/WMTS/tile/1.0.0/World_Topo_Map/default/default028mm/{z}/{y}/{x}.png' attr='Esri ..., Ablajan or anything else...') gjson = corona_gpd.to_crs(epsg='4326').to_json()\n\ndf3 = df2.set_index('CNTRY_NAME')['TotalDeaths'].dropna()\n\ncolorscale = branca.colormap.linear.YlOrRd_09.scale(df2.TotalDeaths.min(), df2.TotalDeaths.max())\n\ndef style_function(feature):\n\nTotalDeaths = df3.get(int(feature['id'][-1:]), None)\n\nreturn {\n\n'fillOpacity': 1,\n\n'weight': 1,\n\n'fillColor': '#black' if TotalDeaths is None else colorscale(TotalCases)\n\n}\n\ncolorscale.add_to(map)\n\ncolorscale.caption = 'Total Deaths by Country'\n\ncountry = folium.features.GeoJson(gjson, tooltip=folium.features.GeoJsonTooltip(fields=['TotalDeaths']),\n\nstyle_function=style_function)\n\nmap.add_child(country)\n\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(map)\n\n# save map as html\n\nresults =\u201dC:\\\\Users\\\\Desktop\\\\map\\\\\u201d\n\nmap.save(os.path.join(results, \u2018Total_Deaths_by_Country.html\u2019))\n\nembed_map(map)\n\nWhen we run the above code, the output will be:\n\nCOVID-19 Total Deaths by Country\n\nThe interactive map can be served as an HTML leaflet map on any website. It can be accessed here. Please note that there are some countries without data on the map. It indicates that some countries and the COVID-19 dataset were not merged correctly due to naming discrepancies between country data and COVID19 data. It seems the dataframe needs more cleaning. As COVID-19 datasets [3] become more accessible, we can use free open datasets in a clean format instead of web scraping and data cleaning. The above python scripts can be tested with Our World in Data (cumulative data), and some other available COVID-19 datasets. For example:\n\n\n\n# filter certain country\n\ncovid_ca =covid[covid.location =='Canada'].sort_values(['total_cases'],ascending=False)\n\ncovid_ca.head(10) covid= pd.read_csv(\u2018 https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv' # filter certain countrycovid_ca =covid[covid.location =='Canada'].sort_values(['total_cases'],ascending=False)covid_ca.head(10)\n\nCOVID-19 in Canada\n\nThe dataframe above (Our World in Data) includes the number of cumulative cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) worldwide for mapping. Interactive maps can be created easily by using a powerful open source geospatial visualization tool kepler.gl. For example:\n\n# keep wanted columns only\n\ncovid_gdp=covid_gdp[[\u2018COUNTRY\u2019, \u2018TotalCases\u2019, \u2018TotalDeaths\u2019,\u2019NewDeaths\u2019, \u2018TotalRecovered\u2019, \u2018ActiveCases\u2019,\u2019Serious_Critical\u2019, \u2018geometry\u2019 ]]\n\nimport keplergl\n\ncorona = keplergl.KeplerGl(height=500)\n\ncorona.add_data(data=covid_gdp, name='Covid_19')\n\ncorona.save_to_html(file_name='.\\covid19_map.html')\n\ncorona\n\nkepler.gl Interactive Map\n\nThe above map can be accessed here. kepler.gl is capable of processing large scale geospatial data to create beautiful visualizations. It can handle a variety of maps, such as points, networks, choropleth, cluster map, heat map, time series maps and can be configured easily. Now that we have some ideas for mapping using COVID-19 data. It\u2019s time to put this into practice.\n\nIn this tutorial, we learned web scraping, data wrangling, plotting, and creating choropleth interactive maps by using python libraries Matplotlib, Geopandas, Pandas, Numpy, Folium, hvplot and kepler.gl . Web scraping and data cleaning rules (scripts) depend on your project. As we can see, different types of data will require different types of cleaning. Obviously, no matter how much we scrub the data, it will never be perfectly clean.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the tutorial. Please don\u2019t hesitate to write comments and questions.\n\nReferences:",

        "title": "Why Did I Quit Vue for React?",
        "text": "But, I Gave React a Try (Again)\n\nI didn\u2019t tell you that before learning Vue that I tried React, but it was too brutal at first glance. My knowledge about how state management works and knowing more about ES6 language specifications has changed.\n\nI saw plenty of articles even people around me are talking about React, so I give it a try. And it worked. Enough to adopt the framework in my projects.\n\nHere is my point of view of the React's best benefits.\n\n1. ES6 and TypeScript friendly\n\nDevelopers master classes, interfaces, and enumerations. This was why I was able to understand how React components work and integrate into an application.\n\nYou can use ES6 syntax as well with Vue, but React is more well-designed than Vue. Look at how you have to do to register components in React:\n\nFor VueJS, you pass an object to the Vue Component function:\n\nTherefore, modern React (in 2020) doesn\u2019t involve class anymore, but instead functional component (and hooks).\n\nVueJs now offers TypeScript support. This support is not well polished like React using CRA (Create React App) with TS support in a single command.\n\nFor Vue, we still need some third-party packages with custom decorators and features to create a true, complete TypeScript application, and the official documentation does not include all the information you need to get started.\n\n2. JSX\n\nJSX is not evil.\n\nThere are two schools: the pro-JSX, and the anti-JSX. I don\u2019t like to take part in that conflict. JSX can be good or bad; it depends on how you want to work with your template.\n\nFrom my point of view, it is more logical for a developer to write JSX like:\n\nthan the more HTML-ish way of Vue:\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of preference; I find JSX more powerful and flexible.\n\n3. Getting hook by hooks\n\nI started learning and developing with the React component. The problem is that to create a single component as a React component class, it takes a lot of effort.\n\nFunctional components let you use local states with hooks. It removes a lot of boilerplate and useless constructors.\n\nReact Hooks simplify the use of state and other React parts like useEffect instead of componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate .\n\nSome developers like the OOP approach by staying with classes, others the functional approach. You can use both in a project! \ud83e\udd19\n\n4. Community\n\nBehind great projects are great humans.\n\nBy experience, there is much more documentation, third-party tools, and modules for React than Vue.\n\nI sometimes struggled by looking for Nuxt issues and found lots of Next (React) topics.\n\nBy looking at Github repos, the numbers speak for themselves.\n\nOr with their respective frameworks:\n\nCommunity leverage the reliability of your code by solving bug fixes quicker. Finding people with the same problem as you makes your resolution fast.",

        "title": "INDUSTRIAL BUILDING DESIGN",
        "text": "What is industrial building design?\n\nTo develop a built environment based on an undefined building typology.\n\nThe structure functions on the business programming of the managing engineers. The area brief depends on the maximum and minimum space requirements per function unit.\n\nIndustry:\n\nIndustry, a group of productive enterprises or organizations that produce or supply goods, services, or sources of income. In economics, industries are customarily classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary; secondary industries are further classified as heavy and light.\n\nSecondary Industry\n\nThis sector, also called manufacturing industry,\n\n(1) takes the raw materials supplied by primary industries and processes them into consumer goods, or\n\n(2) further processes goods that other secondary industries have transformed into products, or\n\n(3) builds capital goods used to manufacture consumer and non consumer goods. Secondary industry also includes energy-producing industries (e.g., hydroelectric industries) as well as the construction industry.\n\nSecondary industry may be divided into heavy, or large-scale, and light, or small-scale, industry. Large-scale industry generally requires heavy capital investment in plants and machinery, serves a large and diverse market including other manufacturing industries, has a complex industrial organization and frequently a skilled specialized labour force, and generates a large volume of output. Examples would include petroleum refining, steel and iron manufacturing, motor vehicle and heavy machinery manufacture, cement production, nonferrous metal refining, meat-packing, and hydroelectric power generation.\n\nLight, or small-scale, industry may be characterized by the no durability of manufactured products and a smaller capital investment in plants and equipment, and it may involve nonstandard products, such as customized or craft work. The labor force may be either low skilled, as in textile work and clothing manufacture, food processing, and plastics manufacture, or highly skilled, as in electronics and computer hardware manufacture, precision instrument manufacture, gemstone cutting, and craft work.\n\nIndustrial Building Archetype\n\nDesigned to house industrial operations and provide the necessary conditions for workers and the operation of industrial equipment.\n\nThe modern revolution in science and technology, with its constant progress in the construction of industrial buildings andimproved construction technology, has resulted in an increase in the number of enterprises that do not pollute theenvironment. As a result, a new type of urban development, known as the industrial-residential area, has emerged.\n\nContrasting in scale, appearance, and silhouette with standarddesign housing, industrial buildings become importantarchitectural highlights in urban development.\n\nAesthetically, the quality of industrial buildings can be improved by distinctive interior design, sensible proportioninganddivision of enclosed areas, and harmonious choice of structural elements.\n\nIndustrial buildings have an enormousand often negativeimpact on natural and architectural landscapes; and industrialregions often become alienated from the natural environment. One task of industrial architecture is thus maximumpreservation of the natural landscape and harmonious introduction of new industrial buildings into the landscape.\n\nThe integration of industrial buildings is one of the most efficient means of reducing the estimated costs of constructing them.\n\nIn largescale construction, most multistory industrial buildings have three to six floors and ceiling loads of 5to10 kN/m2.When land area is limited, industrial buildings may have ten or more stories.\n\nModern multistory buildings usually have column networks of 6 m \u00d7 6 m, 9 m \u00d7 6 m, or 12 m \u00d7 6 m, and there is a tendency to use even more extended networks. The total width of multistory industrial buildings is usually 36\u201348 m.\n\nIn multistory buildings designed for processes with strict requirements for air purity and temperature and humidity stability, technical floors are constructed for engineering equipment and supply lines; the supply lines may be located within the trusses of intermediate floors.\n\nThere is a tendency tomakegreater use of multistory industrial buildings in industrial construction because of the need to economize on urban sites and lands suitable for agricultural use.\n\nwide spread standardization of design may serve as the basis for a transition to total prefabricated construction of industrial buildings from structures and elements manufactured in factory construction combines. Modern construction is characterized by a tendency to minimize the weight of structural members in order to reduce consumption of materials and the cost of construction and installation. In line with this, the reinforced concrete structural members used in industrial buildings are being improved through the use of high-strength concrete and concrete with light-weight aggregates.\n\nMetal structures are being improved through the use of high strength steel and aluminum alloys and thin walled rolled and bent sections. Improvement of metal structures is also related to the introduction of prestressed metal structures and the construction of light-weight industrial building systems that make use of thin sheet covered surfaces.\n\nSITE CONTEXT\n\nBahadurgarh is a developing town near the outskirts of the capital city, Delhi. The town is rich with agricultural activities. There are several institutions present in its direct vicinity. Religious activities are followed in Hindu temples present in various corners of the town.\n\nMIE is an industrial hub joint with Delhi-Rohtak corridor. There is diverse variety of industrial work in this area\n\nTo motivate the growth of institutional strength, if good job opportunities are provided along with aid to globalization; the town would boost up and all the agriculture activities and small to medium scale industries can be brought together to boon the growth of our nation.\n\nIf a large scale industry is introduced which is energy efficient and produces low pollution; it can bring in people together in a healthy business relationship and can cast good income to existing culture and bring in outsiders which would lead to more development.\n\nBusiness Approach And Concept\n\nClient brief is tabulated on the basis of functions of the works to be delivered by the client with benefit of built environment to be provided by the architect.\n\nPurchaser brief is tabulated on the basis of all plausible outcomes of works that the client wants to deliver.\n\nCategories of zones are formulated on the basis of the proposed work environment and area requirements are derived.\n\nArea Statement\n\nCLIENT BRIEF\n\nPURCHASER BRIEF",

        "text": "This article has its genesis not in the digital domain, nor was it originally sprung forth by the tapping of keys, but its creation can be found on an old legal pad with a Pilot G-2 scratching the story into paper and giving it life.\n\nBut why would someone want to write by hand when there are so many better options?\n\nWell there are some good reasons.\n\nI could tell you about the productivity aspects.\n\nEven though it takes longer initially, I find that over all I\u2019m able to write more. I think this happens for several reasons.\n\nFirst, there are no distractions when writing by hand. Legal pads, at least the kind I use, do not have Youtube. This drastically cuts down on the amount of incursions to my concentration.\n\nThe paper does not have breaking news nor does have notifications, but I must make a small confession, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s entirely free of distractions.\n\nAs I\u2019m prone to doodling in the margins.\n\nPhoto by author\n\nPhoto by author\n\nPhoto by author\n\nPhoto by author\n\nAs you can see, my attention sometimes waver. I will, from time to time, fill up the margins with doodles and drawings, but I like to defend by saying that it\u2019s still helping release some creative energy and I\u2019m doing it while writing and it doesn\u2019t derail my writing day like an episode of The Witcher would.\n\nAdditionally, the words often exist in one\u2019s mind in a sea of chaotic energy. Often, when I sit down at the computer this doesn\u2019t go away and it\u2019s hard to just start typing.\n\nBut, with a pencil or pen, the chaos goes away and my thoughts start draining out as if one pulled a plug.\n\nI this happens for a couple reasons. One, as I child we learn to write by hand, at least I did, there are probably kids that start typing right away now. So picking up a pen has that innate familiarity as that I was the first way I put down ideas.\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said that writing by hand just seems to work better, this is established in the article, \u201c5 Psychological Benefits Of Writing By Hand\u201d by Josh Caryle.\n\nWorking at the computer overloads our sensory system. The flickering of the screen, movement of the cursor, the temptation to the availability of any information in one click \u2014 all this dulls the ability to work. On the contrary, when there is only a sheet of paper and a pen in front of you, the brain does not receive additional stimulation and focuses its resources on a specific task.\n\nThese are all good reasons to write by hand.\n\nBut, I will make a confession, these are not the only reasons I write be hand.\n\nI think when you write by hand is when you feel the most like a writer.\n\nGive me a notebook and a pen, and suddenly I\u2019m Ernest Hemingway writing a Parisian cafe.\n\nThere\u2019s no better feeling.\n\nIt speaks to that little iota of pretension that every write has. Too often, writing is relegated to commercial tasks, and writing by hand can help it feel like the art that it is.\n\nWhen you type other than the click clack there isn\u2019t the same feed back as an artist.\n\nBefore I was a writer, I was an artist, and there was nothing better than watching a drawing or painting come to life.\n\nIt\u2019s the same when you write by hand. The ink flows and the letters appear and the page slowly fills until you can flip the page and after a few minutes there are pages and pages flipped over as the story grows.\n\nIt\u2019s magnificent.\n\nThe tactile feedback.\n\nI have a particular affinity for cursive because it\u2019s more fun to write watching lines morph into letters with just subtle shifts of direction is one of my favorite things to behold.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t done it.\n\nI encourage you to try it.\n\nPlus it just looks cooler.",

        "text": "Most Viruses Are Friendly and Beneficial to Us\n\nYou have heard the bad, here\u2019s the good\n\nPhoto by engin akyurt on Unsplash\n\nMost viruses have a pathogenic relationship with their hosts. They invade the host cell, take over its cellular machinery and release new viral particles that will spread out and infect more cells and cause illness.\n\nBut they\u2019re not all bad. Some viruses can actually kill bacteria, while others can fight against more dangerous viruses. So like protective bacteria (probiotics), we have several protective viruses in our body.\n\nBacteriophages\n\nThese types of viruses are found in the mucus membrane lining in the digestive, respiratory and reproductive tracts. Recent studies suggest that the phages present in the mucus are part of our natural immune system, protecting the human body from invading bacteria.\n\nPhages have been used to treat dysentery, sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, salmonella infections and skin infections for nearly a century. Early sources of phages for therapy included local water bodies, dirt, air, sewage and even body fluids from infected patients.\n\nThese days phages are genetically engineered. Individual strains of phages are tested against target bacteria, and the most effective strains are purified into a potent concentration.\n\nHow phages were discovered\n\nBacteriophages were discovered and named by Canadian-born doctor Felix d\u2019Herelle while studying the feces of French soldiers suffering from dysentery in WWI.\n\nBy filtering the stool samples, d\u2019Herelle was able to isolate the bacteria Shigella that caused the illness. And, he noticed that in some places, the Shigella was being destroyed by none other than an additional virus. After testing the virus on himself, he used it to treat his patients.\n\nDespite this, the idea of injecting live viruses into patients made many doctors uncomfortable. By 1940, phages were superseded by antibiotics in the treatment of diseases. Today, phages have another important role in our world: as protectors of the water.\n\nEvery liter of seawater is home to about 100,000,000,000 viruses.\n\nAdd up all the liters of water in the ocean and that\u2019s a whole lot of viruses! Luckily, marine phages make up part of this virus population. Phages destroy between 15 and 20% of nasty ocean bacteria each day, which prevents cholera and other harmful illnesses from spreading. Without phages, water-borne illnesses would wreak a lot more havoc.\n\nEndogenous retroviruses\n\nThese viruses are generated within the bodies of animals, including humans. These viruses insert their genetic information into the DNA of the host. When the host\u2019s cells divide, the DNA of the virus is also replicated, thus shaping our genes.\n\nOne important endogenous retrovirus is HERV-W, discovered in 1999 by Jen-LucBlond among others. One of the genes of this virus produces syncytin, a protein essential for the bonding of cells in the outer layer of the placenta. In other words, without this retrovirus, we wouldn\u2019t be able to carry children. In this way, we can thank viruses for the survival of our species!\n\nLatent (non-symptomatic) herpes viruses\n\nHelp human natural killer cells identify cancer cells and cells infected by other pathogenic viruses. They arm the natural killer cells with antigens (a foreign substance that can cause an immune response in the body) that will enable them to identify tumour cells.\n\nThis is both a survival tactic by the viruses to last longer within their host, and to get rid of competitive viruses to prevent them from damaging the host. In the future, modified versions of viruses like these could potentially be used to target cancer cells.",

        "text": "Your \u2018Surge Capacity\u2019 Is Depleted \u2014 It\u2019s Why You Feel Awful\n\nHere\u2019s how to pull yourself out of despair and live your life\n\nIt was the end of the world as we knew it, and I felt fine. That\u2019s almost exactly what I told my psychiatrist at my March 16 appointment, a few days after our children\u2019s school district extended spring break because of the coronavirus. I said the same at my April 27 appointment, several weeks after our state\u2019s stay-at-home order.\n\nYes, it was exhausting having a kindergartener and fourth grader doing impromptu distance learning while I was barely keeping up with work. And it was frustrating to be stuck home nonstop, scrambling to get in grocery delivery orders before slots filled up, and tracking down toilet paper. But I was still doing well because I thrive in high-stress emergency situations. It\u2019s exhilarating for my ADHD brain. As just one example, when my husband and I were stranded in Peru during an 8.0-magnitude earthquake that killed thousands, we walked around with a first aid kit helping who we could and tracking down water and food. Then I went out with my camera to document the devastation as a photojournalist and interview Peruvians in my broken Spanish for my hometown paper.\n\nNow we were in a pandemic, and I\u2019m a science journalist who has written about infectious disease and medical research for nearly a decade. I was on fire, cranking out stories, explaining epidemiological concepts in my social networks, trying to help everyone around me make sense of the frightening circumstances of a pandemic and the anxiety surrounding the virus.\n\nI knew it wouldn\u2019t last. It never does. But even knowing I would eventually crash, I didn\u2019t appreciate how hard the crash would be, or how long it would last, or how hard it would be to try to get back up over and over again, or what getting up even looked like.\n\nIn those early months, I, along with most of the rest of the country, was using \u201csurge capacity\u201d to operate, as Ann Masten, PhD, a psychologist and professor of child development at the University of Minnesota, calls it. Surge capacity is a collection of adaptive systems \u2014 mental and physical \u2014 that humans draw on for short-term survival in acutely stressful situations, such as natural disasters. But natural disasters occur over a short period, even if recovery is long. Pandemics are different \u2014 the disaster itself stretches out indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has demonstrated both what we can do with surge capacity and the limits of surge capacity,\u201d says Masten. When it\u2019s depleted, it has to be renewed. But what happens when you struggle to renew it because the emergency phase has now become chronic?\n\nBy my May 26 psychiatrist appointment, I wasn\u2019t doing so hot. I couldn\u2019t get any work done. I\u2019d grown sick of Zoom meetups. It was exhausting and impossible to think with the kids around all day. I felt trapped in a home that felt as much a prison as a haven. I tried to conjure the motivation to check email, outline a story, or review interview notes, but I couldn\u2019t focus. I couldn\u2019t make myself do anything \u2014 work, housework, exercise, play with the kids \u2014 for that whole week.\n\nOr the next.\n\nOr the next.\n\nOr the next.\n\nI know depression, but this wasn\u2019t quite that. It was, as I\u2019d soon describe in an emotional post in a social media group of professional colleagues, an \u201canxiety-tainted depression mixed with ennui that I can\u2019t kick,\u201d along with a complete inability to concentrate. I spoke with my therapist, tweaked medication dosages, went outside daily for fresh air and sunlight, tried to force myself to do some physical activity, and even gave myself permission to mope for a few weeks. We were in a pandemic, after all, and I had already accepted in March that life would not be \u201cnormal\u201d for at least a year or two. But I still couldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t focus, hadn\u2019t adjusted. Shouldn\u2019t I be used to this by now?\n\n\u201cWhy do you think you should be used to this by now? We\u2019re all beginners at this,\u201d Masten told me. \u201cThis is a once in a lifetime experience. It\u2019s expecting a lot to think we\u2019d be managing this really well.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my social media post elicited similar responses from dozens of high-achieving, competent, impressive women I professionally admire that I realized I wasn\u2019t in the minority. My experience was a universal and deeply human one.\n\nAn unprecedented disaster\n\nWhile the phrase \u201cadjusting to the new normal\u201d has been repeated endlessly since March, it\u2019s easier said than done. How do you adjust to an ever-changing situation where the \u201cnew normal\u201d is indefinite uncertainty?\n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented disaster for most of us that is profound in its impact on our daily lives,\u201d says Masten. But it\u2019s different from a hurricane or tornado where you can look outside and see the damage. The destruction is, for most people, invisible and ongoing. So many systems aren\u2019t working as they normally do right now, which means radical shifts in work, school, and home life that almost none of us have experience with. Even those who have worked in disaster recovery or served in the military are facing a different kind of uncertainty right now.\n\n\u201cI think we maybe underestimate how severe the adversity is and that people may be experiencing a normal reaction to a pretty severe and ongoing, unfolding, cascading disaster,\u201d Masten says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that it\u2019s normal in a situation of great uncertainty and chronic stress to get exhausted and to feel ups and downs, to feel like you\u2019re depleted or experience periods of burnout.\u201d\n\nResearch on disaster and trauma focuses primarily on what\u2019s helpful for people during the recovery period, but we\u2019re not close to recovery yet. People can use their surge capacity for acute periods, but when dire circumstances drag on, Masten says, \u201cyou have to adopt a different style of coping.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you adjust to an ever-changing situation where the \u2018new normal\u2019 is indefinite uncertainty?\u201d\n\nUnderstanding ambiguous loss\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that, as a lifelong overachiever, I\u2019ve felt particularly despondent and adrift as the months have dragged on, says Pauline Boss, PhD, a family therapist and professor emeritus of social sciences at the University of Minnesota who specializes in \u201cambiguous loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder for high achievers,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more accustomed you are to solving problems, to getting things done, to having a routine, the harder it will be on you because none of that is possible right now. You get feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, and those aren\u2019t good.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s similar to how Michael Maddaus, MD, a professor of thoracic surgery at the University of Minnesota, felt when he became addicted to prescription narcotics after undergoing several surgeries. Now recovered and a motivational speaker who promotes the idea of a \u201cresilience bank account,\u201d Maddaus had always been a fast-moving high achiever \u2014 until he couldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cI realized that my personal operating system, though it had led to tremendous success, had failed me on a more personal level,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to figure out a different way of contending with life.\u201d\n\nThat mindset is an especially American one, Boss says.\n\n\u201cOur culture is very solution-oriented, which is a good way of thinking for many things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s partly responsible for getting a man on the moon and a rover on Mars and all the things we\u2019ve done in this country that are wonderful. But it\u2019s a very destructive way of thinking when you\u2019re faced with a problem that has no solution, at least for a while.\u201d\n\nThat means reckoning with what\u2019s called ambiguous loss: any loss that\u2019s unclear and lacks a resolution. It can be physical, such as a missing person or the loss of a limb or organ, or psychological, such as a family member with dementia or a serious addiction.\n\n\u201cIn this case, it is a loss of a way of life, of the ability to meet up with your friends and extended family,\u201d Boss says. \u201cIt is perhaps a loss of trust in our government. It\u2019s the loss of our freedom to move about in our daily life as we used to.\u201d It\u2019s also the loss of high-quality education, or the overall educational experience we\u2019re used to, given school closures, modified openings and virtual schooling. It\u2019s the loss of rituals, such weddings, graduations, and funerals, and even lesser \u201crituals,\u201d such as going to gym. One of the toughest losses for me to adapt to is no longer doing my research and writing in coffee shops as I\u2019ve done for most of my life, dating back to junior high.\n\n\u201cThese were all things we were attached to and fond of, and they\u2019re gone right now, so the loss is ambiguous. It\u2019s not a death, but it\u2019s a major, major loss,\u201d says Boss. \u201cWhat we used to have has been taken away from us.\u201d\n\nJust as painful are losses that may result from the intersection of the pandemic and the already tense political division in the country. For many people, issues related to Covid-19 have become the last straw in ending relationships, whether it\u2019s a family member refusing to wear a mask, a friend promoting the latest conspiracy theory, or a co-worker insisting Covid-19 deaths are exaggerated.\n\nAmbiguous loss elicits the same experiences of grief as a more tangible loss \u2014 denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance \u2014 but managing it often requires a bit of creativity.\n\nA winding, uncharted path to coping in a pandemic\n\nWhile there isn\u2019t a handbook for functioning during a pandemic, Masten, Boss, and Maddaus offered some wisdom for meandering our way through this.\n\nAccept that life is different right now\n\nMaddaus\u2019 approach involves radical acceptance. \u201cIt\u2019s a shitty time, it\u2019s hard,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to accept that in your bones and be okay with this as a tough day, with \u2018that\u2019s the way it is,\u2019 and accept that as a baseline.\u201d\n\nBut that acceptance doesn\u2019t mean giving up, he says. It means not resisting or fighting reality so that you can apply your energy elsewhere. \u201cIt allows you to step into a more spacious mental space that allows you to do things that are constructive instead of being mired in a state of psychological self torment.\u201d\n\nExpect less from yourself\n\nMost of us have heard for most of our lives to expect more from ourselves in some way or another. Now we must give ourselves permission to do the opposite. \u201cWe have to expect less of ourselves, and we have to replenish more,\u201d Masten says. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a period of a lot of self discovery: Where do I get my energy? What kind of down time do I need? That\u2019s all shifted right now, and it may take some reflection and self discovery to find out what rhythms of life do I need right now?\u201d\n\nShe says people are having to live their lives without the support of so many systems that have partly or fully broken down, whether it\u2019s schools, hospitals, churches, family support, or other systems that we relied on. We need to recognize that we\u2019re grieving multiple losses while managing the ongoing impact of trauma and uncertainty. The malaise so many of us feel, a sort of disinterested boredom, is common in research on burnout, Masten says. But other emotions accompany it: disappointment, anger, grief, sadness, exhaustion, stress, fear, anxiety \u2014 and no one can function at full capacity with all that going on.\n\nRecognize the different aspects of grief\n\nThe familiar \u201cstages\u201d of grief don\u2019t actually occur in linear stages, Boss says, but denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are all major concepts in facing loss. Plenty of people are in denial: denying the virus is real, or that the numbers of cases or deaths are as high as reported, or that masks really help reduce disease transmission.\n\nAnger is evident everywhere: anger at those in denial, anger in the race demonstrations, anger at those not physically distancing or wearing masks, and even anger at those who wear masks or require them. The bargaining, Boss says, is mostly with scientists we hope will develop a vaccine quickly. The depression is obvious, but acceptance\u2026 \u201cI haven\u2019t accepted any of this,\u201d Boss says. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you.\u201d\n\nSometimes acceptance means \u201csaying we\u2019re going to have a good time in spite of this,\u201d Boss says, such as when my family drove an hour outside the city to get far enough from light pollution to look for the comet NEOWISE. But it can also mean accepting that we cannot change the situation right now.\n\n\u201cWe can kick and scream and be angry, or we can feel the other side of it, with no motivation, difficulty focusing, lethargy,\u201d Boss says, \u201cor we can take the middle way and just have a couple days where you feel like doing nothing and you embrace the losses and sadness you\u2019re feeling right now, and then the next day, do something that has an element of achievement to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur new normal is always feeling a little off balance, like trying to stand in a dinghy on rough seas, and not knowing when the storm will pass.\u201d\n\nExperiment with \u201cboth-and\u201d thinking\n\nThis approach may not work for everyone, but Boss says there\u2019s an alternative to binary thinking that many people find helpful in dealing with ambiguous loss. She calls it \u201cboth-and\u201d thinking, and sometimes it means embracing a bit of the irrational.\n\nFor the families of soldiers missing in action in Vietnam that Boss studied early in her career, or the family members of victims of plane crashes where the bodies aren\u2019t recovered, this type of thinking means thinking: \u201cHe is both living and maybe not. She is probably dead but maybe not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you stay in the rational when nothing else is rational, like right now, then you\u2019ll just stress yourself more,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I say with ambiguous loss is the situation is crazy, not the person. The situation is pathological, not the person.\u201d\n\nAn analogous approach during the pandemic might be, \u201cThis is terrible and many people are dying, and this is also a time for our families to come closer together,\u201d Boss says. On a more personal level, \u201cI\u2019m highly competent, and right now I\u2019m flowing with the tide day-to-day.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s existence, but when you can\u2019t change the situation, \u201cthe only thing you can change is your perception of it,\u201d she says.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean denying the existence of the pandemic or the coronavirus. As Maddaus says, \u201cYou have to face reality.\u201d But how we frame that reality mentally can help us cope with it.\n\nLook for activities, new and old, that continue to fulfill you\n\nLots of coping advice has focused on \u201cself-care,\u201d but one of the frustrating ironies of the pandemic is that so many of our self-care activities have also been taken away: pedicures, massages, coffee with friends, a visit to the amusement park, a kickboxing class, swimming in the local pool \u2014 these activities remain unsafe in much of the country. So we have to get creative with self-care when we\u2019re least motivated to get creative.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re forced to rethink our options and broaden out what we think of as self-care, sometimes that constraint opens new ways of living and thinking,\u201d Masten says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of control over the global pandemic but we do over our daily lives. You can focus on plans for the future and what\u2019s meaningful in life.\u201d\n\nFor me, since I missed eating in restaurants and was tired of our same old dinners, I began subscribing to a meal-kit service. I hate cooking, but the meal kits were easy, and I was motivated by the chance to eat something that tasted more like what I\u2019d order in a restaurant without having to invest energy in looking through recipes or ordering the right ingredients.\n\nOkay, I\u2019ve also been playing a lot of Animal Crossing, but Maddaus explains why it makes sense that creative activities like cooking, gardening, painting, house projects \u2014 or even building your own imaginary island out of pixels \u2014 can be fulfilling right now. He references the book The Molecule of More, which explores how dopamine influences our experiences and happiness, in describing the types of activities most likely to bring us joy.\n\n\u201cThere are two ways the brain deals with the world: the future and things we need to go after, and the here and now, seeing things and touching things,\u201d Maddaus says. \u201cRather than being at the mercy of what\u2019s going on, we can use the elements of our natural reward system and construct things to do that are good no matter what.\u201d\n\nThose kinds of activities have a planning element and a here-and-now experience element. For Maddaus, for example, it was simply replacing all the showerheads and lightbulbs in the house. \u201cIt\u2019s a silly thing, but it made me feel good,\u201d he says.\n\nFocus on maintaining and strengthening important relationships\n\nThe biggest protective factors for facing adversity and building resilience are social support and remaining connected to people, Masten says. That includes helping others, even when we\u2019re feeling depleted ourselves.\n\n\u201cHelping others is one of those win-win strategies of taking action because we\u2019re all feeling a sense of helplessness and loss of control about what\u2019s going on with this pandemic, but when you take action with other people, you can control what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she says. Helping others could include checking in on family friends or buying groceries for an elderly neighbor.\n\nBegin slowly building your resilience bank account\n\nMaddaus\u2019 idea of a resilience bank account is gradually building into your life regular practices that promote resilience and provide a fallback when life gets tough. Though it would obviously be nice to have a fat account already, he says it\u2019s never too late to start. The areas he specifically advocates focusing on are sleep, nutrition, exercise, meditation, self-compassion, gratitude, connection, and saying no.\n\n\u201cStart really small and work your way up,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you do a little bit every day, it starts to add up and you get momentum, and even if you miss a day, then start again. We have to be gentle with ourselves and keep on, begin again.\u201d",

As the pandemic progressed and eventually exploded throughout the country, many quarantiners found themselves even more drawn to these comfortingly repetitive actions\u2014remember the flour shortage?\u2014which, per research cited in Raphael\u2019s story, \u201cincrease a person\u2019s belief that they can manage a situation that is otherwise out of their hands.\u201d\n\nNow, if you\u2019re anything like me, the charm of housekeeping has ebbed and flowed depending on your level of frustration and despair about the state of the world \u2014 and I would love to never have to repair my own dishwasher ever again. Still, I hope the tidying up, baking, and general holiday-magic-making of the season (if that\u2019s your thing) have provided some much-needed small joy and satisfaction during a difficult time. If nothing else, you know it\u2019s going to feel damn good to vacuum up all those pine needles once you\u2019ve said farewell to your tree.\n\nRevisit Raphael\u2019s story about the therapeutic benefits of housework here:",

        "title": "Now Is the Time to Discuss Order Fulfilment",
        "text": "What is Order fulfilment?\n\nOrder fulfilment is the process of receiving and storing inventory to be sold online to consumers or B2B clients, during which orders are processed and delivered to each customer.\n\nThe process starts when a customer places an order and concludes once they receive it by post or courier.\n\nWhat is the order fulfilment process?\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the steps involved in order fulfilment:\n\nReceiving inbound inventory \u2014 You send your stock to a fulfilment warehouse Storage of inventory \u2014 Your stock is stored awaiting online orders Order processing \u2014 this includes: Pick and pack / Kitting or light assembly of hampers or gift sets Shipping \u2014 At the carrier station each order is packed and despatched to your customer via an integrated courier partner Returns management \u2014 Orders are returned to a fulfilment centre location. So if a buyer wants to return a product, a 3PL partner manages the return transaction as well as quality, stock update or disposal\n\nThese are the five key order fulfilment steps that ensure same-day fulfilment and outbound shipping to enhance your customer\u2019s experience.\n\nCan order fulfilment companies integrate with my website?\n\nYes. Any Warehouse Management Software (WMS), order fulfilment technology, is the bridge between your eCommerce platform and a fulfilment partner. Features include:\n\nInventory management\n\nOrder management\n\nShipping tracking management\n\nReporting functionality\n\nMost WMS can integrate with off-the-shelf versions of leading eCommerce platforms such as:\n\nShopify Shopify Plus Magento Squarespace EKM WooCommerce BigCommerce Linnworks\n\nOther integrations include:\n\nMarketplaces \u2014 Amazon and eBay Carriers \u2014 too many to mention\n\nIf you choose to outsource, you can integrate from a vast selection of \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 eCommerce platforms, which can be done in a few clicks with no technical experience.\n\nAlternatively, a self-service solution means that you can import your orders through a client portal.\n\nHow does the Order fulfilment Goods-in process work?\n\nA unique WMS account is created for every online retailing client. In doing so, your Third-Party-Logistic (3PL) partner can integrate and check-in barcoded products more efficiently, typically within 24\u201372 hours depending on seasonal demand.\n\nOnce your stock is received, a barcode scanner identifies the correct product and storage location. This process ensures a fast, accurate and efficient order fulfilment process going forward once onboarded.\n\nHow does the Order fulfilment storage process work?\n\nEach product is allocated a unique location in a 3PL warehouse with fast-moving products stored in easy to access bays and slower-moving goods on pallets or upper levels. The data collected during the goods-in process can automate and optimise space utilization, order picking efficiency in addition to batch tracing.\n\nAlso, a WMS customer portal empowers online retailers to view stock, order status and tracking in real-time. The WMS pushes all data to your preferred eCommerce platform, like Shopify, WooCommerce or Magento.\n\nHow does the Pick and Pack process work?\n\nThe pick and pack process is a vital step in the order fulfilment process.\n\nEvery day operatives print out order sheets within minutes of your customer placing an order online. Each order sheet contains the following information:\n\nAccount \u2014 Your business and relevant customer shipping address\n\n\u2014 Your business and relevant customer shipping address Order details \u2014 Each product purchased, quantity and variant\n\n\u2014 Each product purchased, quantity and variant Location \u2014 The associated floor, isle and bay number for your products\n\nExperienced 3PL teams with WMS know-how can pick and pack with a 99.9% accuracy. Also, your inventory and order status is automatically updated once each order is picked, validated and shipped.\n\nPhoto by Kumpan Electric on Unsplash\n\nHow does the light assembly / kitting process work?\n\nMany online retailers sell hampers, subscription boxes or gift sets. As such 3PLs pre-assemble complex SKUs \u2014 a selection of simple SKUs \u2014 to create a new SKU, a bundle.\n\nA scheduled assembly process is planned by 3PLs with online retailing clients to meet seasonal demand, ranging from 200 to 25,000 kits a month. This enhances your value proposition by selling product-bundles at a reduced cost, due to fulfilment efficiencies, enhancing conversion as a result.\n\nHow does the Order Fulfilment Shipping process work?\n\nMost 3PLs are integrated with carriers to automate the shipping process.\n\nWhen you convert a customer, orders are picked and validated, after which the shipping team owns the next step, to pack and despatch via a carrier network. At the shipping station, each order is allocated the most cost-effective and timely shipping service based on your requirements.\n\nA lean 3PL process ensures that 99.9% of orders are shipped the same day, traceable, affordable and fast. A good 3PL service provider can enhance your customer satisfaction, leading to loyalty and repeat online purchases.\n\nHow does the returns process work?\n\nReverse logistics can have an impact on your business. In fact, industry reports indicate that over 90% of online consumers become repeat buyers if returns are easy to do. Returns management is important and looks like this:\n\nInbound \u2014 Evaluate goods for quality or damage before checking-in\n\n\u2014 Evaluate goods for quality or damage before checking-in Evaluate \u2014 Restock or quarantine\n\n\u2014 Restock or quarantine Action \u2014Update stock or dispose\n\nUpon receipt, 3PL service providers notify clients about products that are unsuitable for re-sale, mitigating the risk of future returns.\n\nSome brands simply absorb all return costs and credit customers in good faith regardless of the dispute.\n\nWhat countries can my 3PL partner send my orders?\n\nAnywhere. Global shipping channels are available to all 3PLs.\n\nHow much does an Order Fulfilment services cost?\n\nThere are five cost points for order fulfilment, as follows:\n\nInbound \u2014 To check-in, unpack and put-away goods Storage \u2014 The associated warehousing cost Pick and Pack \u2014 For fulfilment and/or kitting assembly Materials \u2014 This includes box, tape, label and filler Shipping \u2014 Need I say more?\n\nFrom a budget perspective, each cost point might look like this:\n\nInbound \u2014 \u20ac20 to \u20ac30 per pallet Storage \u2014 \u20ac20 to \u20ac50 per bay per month depending on storage type Pick and Pack \u2014 The first pick tends to be \u20ac1.20 to \u20ac1.40 with each additional pick costing \u20ac0.60 to \u20ac0.70 Materials \u2014 Can range from \u20ac0.25 for an envelope or \u20ac0.70 to \u20ac1.00 or more for a box Shipping \u2014 Starting from \u20ac4 or \u20ac5 for domestic tracked and signed delivery\n\nCalculator by Author\n\nAs a rule of thumb, your order fulfilment should look this:\n\nDomestic \u2014 \u20ac6 to \u20ac8 per order (higher for international) Financial \u2014 Anywhere between 8%\u201312% of revenue\n\nWhile there are various 3PL pricing models out there, they all tend to aggregate between the upper and lower limits above.",

        "title": "How I Trained My Mind to Cope with a Panic Attack",
        "text": "How I Trained My Mind to Cope with a Panic Attack\n\nIn 7 Steps\n\nPhoto by The Vantage Point on Unsplash\n\nI was standing, facing my boyfriend, in the 34th street subway station in New York City. The fluorescent lights shone above my head and subway cars darted left and right on the tracks around me. It was summer in New York City, so it was humid, sticky, and stuffy. Hundreds of people were squished into the narrow halls of the subway station waiting eagerly for the next train.\n\nOut of nowhere, I was struck with a hot flash, and my vision shifted, showing my world off-kilter. I broke out in a raging sweat and my vision wasn\u2019t correcting itself. My knees shook and I couldn\u2019t hold my own weight anymore. I fell to the ground as my heart beat with an intensity so frightful I was convinced I was dying. So convinced that I was dying, I muttered a goodbye to my boyfriend, as he cradled me in his arms on the filthy wooden bench to wait out whatever was happening to me. I looked at him desperately and told him to call 911 because I knew I needed help.\n\nContrary to my belief, this was not a heart attack. It wasn\u2019t until several weeks later that I learned what I had suffered was in fact a panic attack.\n\nBut, how could I have a panic attack if I wasn\u2019t panicked, I wondered. In that moment, preceding the episode, I wasn\u2019t nervous or worried, or feeling particularly scared about anything. I had always thought you needed to be in a state of stress or anxiety in order to have a panic attack\u2026\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis panic attack came out of nowhere and it came with a vengeance. It attacked so strongly and screamed at me so loudly that I was instantly awoken to the fact that my anxiety had gotten out of my control. Having just started graduate school and experienced a break up with whom I thought was the love of my life, I was understandably distraught but I thought I had been doing a good job of keeping my pot of anxiety from boiling over.\n\nThis panic attack was literally a wake up call. I knew I needed to start taking control of my underlying anxiety, because ignoring it only worked as a coping mechanism for so long.\n\nPanic attacks are terrifying, and unfortunately they seem to be quite common. Although there is no cure or quick-fix solution to lessening the symptoms or reducing the occurrence of panic attacks, there are techniques that can help.\n\nIn facing my panic attacks and anxiety in general I think the best thing I ever did for myself was seeking therapy. I am such a believer in therapy that I now recommend it to any and everyone. You don\u2019t even need to have a diagnosis to benefit from a third party professional helping you out with your problems.\n\nI resisted the idea of seeing a therapist since I was 16. I think it\u2019s because I wanted to be able to handle my problems on my own, and to prove my own strength in a way. Seeking therapy, to me, was surrendering to the fact that I needed help I couldn\u2019t provide myself. But I\u2019m so glad I did. And I think if you find the right therapist that practices the kind of therapy that is right for you, it will provide you some relief and help you to navigate this world with more ease.\n\nThis article isn\u2019t about therapy, however. It\u2019s about shorter-term techniques I enacted to help me deal with panic attacks in the moment to buy myself some time before I could see a therapist.\n\nSince I\u2019ve faced panic attacks head on, and have grown successful in fending them off and calming my body naturally, I want to share my experience.\n\nI have dabbled in self-experimentation and playing detective to my own or others\u2019 medical problems from a young age. When I was younger, my ER-doctor father would consult me with challenging medical cases that needed a creative solution and I would ponder over them for weeks. I was obsessed with the scientific method, and this likely inspired my constant self-experimentation and academic pursuit of Epidemiology.\n\nGrowing up, whenever I was faced with an ailment, it was a new challenge for me to solve. For example, in college I used to suffer horrible, debilitating migraines with auras. Yet, after testing out dietary modifications and discovering that vegetarianism reduced my migraines, I haven\u2019t had a migraine since.\n\nSimilarly, when I had my first panic attack at 22 years old, opposed to the idea of daily anxiety medication (another way of acknowledging that maybe I had a condition or needed help I couldn\u2019t give myself), I instead decided to try different mental techniques at the onset of a panic attack, or for occurrences of heightened anxiety.\n\nWith dedication to these techniques, I have now been panic attack-free for 4 years.\n\nAs I\u2019m not a medical doctor or a therapist, I can in no way properly endorse the techniques I\u2019ve tried, but they\u2019ve worked for me in combatting my anxiety and panic attacks and so if you are willing to try something different, then my advice is here.\n\nSince I had my first panic attack in a NYC subway station, I understandably was scared to revisit that setting where I could be susceptible to it happening again. Instead, I thought that if I could get myself to be ok and not nervous in a subway station, that I would win against anxiety. I took it on as a challenge and actually started to spend more time in subway stations. I\u2019d sit on a bench and take the time to examine myself internally. How was my breathing? How was my heart rate? What was I thinking about? How was I feeling? Was I nervous? If so, what\u2019s triggering me to be nervous?\n\nImmersing myself in the setting that had previously brought on a panic attack was risky. But I kept telling myself that a panic attack would not kill me, and I needed to understand why it happened. Evaluating my body and my mind while in the subway helped me to understand the way I was feeling in this environment. I understood my triggers, which was being in a cramped space and feeling claustrophobic and stuck. I also came to understand that I was over stimulated by the combination of people, lights and sounds.\n\nAs I came to learn what was making me anxious, I felt that I had a better grasp on the anxiety, and that it was something that could be managed. It was like the anxiety literally shrunk from a large black cloud to something that could fit in the palm of my hand.\n\nIt was a manageable size and I was bigger and stronger in comparison to it.\n\nAfter taking the time to learn and understand my nervous triggers, instead of avoiding these triggers, which would seem intuitive, I actually sought to immerse myself in them. I think this practice is somewhat akin to immersion therapy, but I felt stronger facing my fears head-on rather than avoiding them, and I felt like they had less power over me and like I was the one in control.\n\nGranted, facing the sources of my nervousness was not easy. I would still suffer from pre-panic attack symptoms while riding the subway quite often. I realized I needed to go a step further than just understanding my symptoms.\n\nWhen symptoms of anxiety and pre-panic attack, like feelings of hot flashes, band-like headaches, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, and flustered thoughts would set in, I decided I had to take myself somewhere else. Not physically, but mentally.\n\nI would close my eyes, and imagine myself on a wide, expansive, airy beach with soft warm sand and crystal blue waters. The ability to create this other world and imagine myself in it provided me with so much relief. I could transport from the bright, loud, crowded, sticky subway car to a place where I could catch my breath.\n\nSeeing this place in my mind allowed my body to follow suit and relax.\n\nMy chest would open up so I could breath again, my heart rate would slow down, and my muscles would unclench. I was offered relief although physically in a place that caused me stress.\n\nSeveral months later, I was watching a war movie in a large dark theater, where the loud banging, flashing lights, and commotion of the movie simulated a situation similar to the subway station. I felt a band tightening around my head and thought it was just a headache coming on until my world tilted and I started hyperventilating. It all happened so fast, and again, I wasn\u2019t actually nervous about anything. The movie itself got my heart pounding, but I had never been affected by a movie like that previously.\n\nI gathered the strength to remove myself from the theater and sit on a bench to collect myself. Luckily a friend was there to help me as I felt absolutely out of it. It felt like I had been hit in the head by a baseball bat and I wasn\u2019t sure what was real and what wasn\u2019t. Although the episode only lasted about 20 minutes I was exhausted for the rest of the night. It felt like I had just ran a marathon and weathered a storm so intense that I could sleep for days.\n\nThis experience gave me further insight to my anxiety. It helped me to figure out that I get nervous in cramped spaces, not just subway stations. It helped me to figure out that I get triggered by bright lights, flashing, and loud noises, and not just those in the subway station. Although painful, the experience didn\u2019t kill me and it provided me more information to understand my anxiety and the source of these episodes.\n\nUltimately, by continuing to immerse myself (in doses) in the places that caused me stress, I was able to face that stress head on and, I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say I conquered it, but I did decrease it to a manageable level. And that was enough. It was enough to get me through the moment and the collections of moments that turned into days, until I could seek the professional help I needed.\n\nOverall, I would summarize my techniques for managing panic attacks in the following ways:\n\n1. In the moment, sit or lie down. Look around you for:\n\n\u00b7 5 things you can see\n\n\u00b7 4 things you can touch\n\n\u00b7 3 things you can hear\n\n\u00b7 2 things you can smell\n\n\u00b7 1 thing you can taste\n\nThis technique is called grounding, and it will help you to feel more in control of your environment. This is a good technique to help you in the moment, before you start to understand what triggers your panic attacks.\n\n2. Visualize a safer space\n\nThis technique is also a more in-the-moment technique, in which you close your eyes and imagine yourself in a space that doesn\u2019t cause you anxiety, a space in which you feel comfortable and in control. For me, that space is an open, expansive place. Potentially a clear beach or a large field of dewy grass. Let your mind take you to that place. Once you feel like you are actually in that place, your mind will feel more relieved and you will notice that your body will relax too.\n\n3. Be aware of your anxiety.\n\nBe a student to your anxiety and the environment you are in when you feel extreme nervousness or a panic attack coming on. Observe and take note of what situations might cause increased anxiety. What exactly is making you anxious, or what in your environment is causing you to feel certain ways? Try recording these observations in a notebook.\n\n4. Understand your anxiety.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve become awake and aware of your anxiety, you can take steps towards understanding it. Try to address questions like why are these situations making you nervous or anxious? Answering a question like this might be rather difficult\u2026 and honestly you might not be able to understand it on your own. This is a place in the process where a therapist might be able to help you in finding relief from, or avoiding, panic attacks. Also ask yourself about the feelings accompanying or preceding the anxiety.\n\n5. Sit with your anxiety.\n\nOnce you are aware of your triggers and understand why you are triggered to feel anxious, try sitting with your anxiety. For me, this is incredibly painful. But that pain only lasts about 90 seconds, and once you\u2019ve made it through, you\u2019ll feel somewhat invincible. For me, it felt freeing. Knowing that I could sit with my anxiety and it wouldn\u2019t destroy or kill me helped me to feel like I could mange it.\n\n6. Embrace or Immerse yourself in your anxiety.\n\nThis technique doesn\u2019t work for everyone. Like I explained earlier, I personally saw my anxiety as a challenge to be addressed. Not everyone will have this mindset or see the need to approach their anxiety in this way, and that\u2019s totally fine! By embracing your anxiety I mean going back to those situations that provoked panic, sitting with the anxiety, and fending it off. Doing so has helped me to re-frame my anxiety as something that I can control, rather than something that controls me, and as something that I have the power over. Feeling so provides relief and confidence that you can deal with more situations where you feel anxious.\n\n7. Talk to a therapist.\n\nWhile there are techniques to deal with anxiety, seeing a therapist is what has provided me the most long-term relief with underlying anxiety. I have seen therapists that I don\u2019t like, however, so it is important to do some research on therapists in your insurance network before choosing one or several to test out. Do some research to find therapists that specialize in the type of treatment you are seeking. There are many types of therapy, and some are better suited to different issues. In the past, I\u2019ve tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and the process of diving into my childhood didn\u2019t provide relief for my daily anxiety. It made it worse, actually. More recently, I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist who practices Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is like a mindfulness-based approach to therapy that has helped me to live more easily and address my problems and feelings in the moment. It\u2019s helped me tremendously over the past year or so and it\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019ve felt positively about my future. Finding a therapist that works for you can be an arduous process. You cannot benefit from a therapy if you don\u2019t feel comfortable or like you can trust your therapist. You are, after all, putting in yourself in a very vulnerable situation, but one that will provide you so much relief through the process.\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is always hope. There is always hope for controlling your anxiety, and even if you are in a situation where you feel like you\u2019ve surrendered to it, you can recover from it. I know that first-hand. It\u2019s not easy helping yourself, or seeking the help you might need. If you don\u2019t have the strength now, that is OK. As humans, we are not perfect. Some days are dark but without the dark days we don\u2019t appreciate the light ones. Although anxiety might feel like constant dark days, there will be a light one or a light moment where you will discover that you are stronger than your anxiety.",

        "title": "If LeBron James Needs Rest and Recovery, You Probably Do Too",
        "text": "If LeBron James Needs Rest and Recovery, You Probably Do Too\n\nHustle culture isn\u2019t doing you any favors\n\nPhoto: Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n\nLeBron James told the productivity guru Tim Ferriss on his show that he sleeps eight or nine hours each night. Sometimes 10. If the basketball star can\u2019t get that stretch in at night, he\u2019ll catch up with a two-hour nap.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just sleep that\u2019s vital to James\u2019 regime: As he chatted with Ferriss, you could hear some rustling in the background. His trainer of 15 years, Mike Mancias, explained that the athlete was applying ice to his knees.\n\n\u201cRecovery never stops,\u201d Mancias said. That\u2019s the sentence to remember.\n\n\u201cIf LeBron plays 40 minutes one night, if he plays 28 minutes one night,\u201d said Mancias, \u201cwe\u2019re still going to keep recovery as our number one focus, whether that be in nutrition, whether that be in hydration, more flexibility exercises, stuff in the weight room. It\u2019s a never-ending process, really. And I think that\u2019s the approach that we must take in order for us to be successful.\u201d\n\nJames isn\u2019t the only top athlete who\u2019s obsessive about quality shut-eye. Usain Bolt, Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Steve Nash also cite lots of sleep as crucial to their performance. It\u2019s obvious that sleep is essential \u2014 not just for physically demanding activities like sports, but also for knowledge work and creative professions.\n\nBut sleep, and the lack of it, isn\u2019t the only issue. Rest and recovery are also key \u2014 and not just for professional athletes. We all know how tough it can be to host a long meeting, or how exhausted we are after hours of creativity. So, why are we so reluctant to give ourselves the time we need to recover?\n\nSleep is still a hard sell\n\nIt\u2019s not just that we can\u2019t stand the idea of working less in order to sleep more \u2014 it\u2019s working less for any reason at all that petrifies us. This deeply embedded cult of busy isn\u2019t something you can combat with a long vacation and a few pills. It requires a huge shift in societal attitudes and awareness.\n\nOur hunter-gatherer ancestors \u201cworked\u201d about 3 to 5 hours per day. Many people today could probably get away with less work than that to ensure their survival, yet we keep busting our backs. Work hours have barely changed since the 1950s, and have actually increased recently.\n\nAlthough sleep health in the United States has been improving, in 2018, a mere 27% of Americans reported getting the recommended seven to nine hours on weekdays, and only 10% claimed they prioritize sleep. Hustle culture is still alive and kicking, with Elon Musk admitting it\u2019s often \u201cno sleep or Ambien\u201d and one in three Goldman Sachs employees feeling \u201cutterly strung out\u201d by their work at the bank.\n\nIf sleep really is so central to success, then why is it so hard to get people excited about going to bed? Well, for starters, no matter how good it is for our bodies and minds, sleep feels like dead time. There\u2019s no real way to multitask with sleep, no matter how hard we try. It\u2019s not like running, where you can turn on a podcast and passively soak up ideas along the way. With sleep, you\u2019re forced to single-task with no recollection of the time you put in \u2014 and that\u2019s tough to swallow.\n\nThe deeper problem\n\nSleep is just the tip of the iceberg. The real problem runs much deeper \u2014 and it starts with the status of work in our modern culture.\n\nThis has both cultural and technological causes. We invented machines to alleviate manual labor, but then applied that model to creative and intellectual labor as well. In his book, Rest, the researcher Alex Soojung-Kim Pang explains:\n\nThe modern office was conceptualized as a machine for rationalizing and organizing intellectual labor, and it copied the working hours of factories. But the model has been an imperfect fit in creative industries, as it\u2019s extremely hard to measure productivity and quality in creative and knowledge work.\n\nEight-hour shifts, an open and transparent physical environment, clocking times \u2014 these all make sense for producing units of a tangible product. But for year-long projects to develop innovative business strategies? Not so much. Yet we still have the 40-hour work week, open offices, and time-tracking systems.\n\nMeanwhile, status-driven spending, increased parenting stress, compulsive use of social media, and long commutes keep our minds busy outside of work too \u2014 despite our domestic lives being increasingly automated, thanks to washing machines, kitchen appliances, and smart-home technology.\n\nIf the purpose of civilization is to indeed make us more civilized, then it seems we\u2019ve got it backwards. We\u2019re either busy using computers for the wrong tasks, or we\u2019re trying to act as computers ourselves in areas where that clearly doesn\u2019t work, like thinking and creating.\n\nA framing of downtime I want to embrace\n\nLet\u2019s go back to that moment in the chat between Tim Ferriss and Lebron James: \u201cRecovery never stops.\u201d\n\nClearly, a good sleep routine is just one part of a much bigger picture: We must complement work with seemingly unrelated activities if we really want to deliver our best performance.\n\nRecovery is key, and it plays a larger role than passive recuperation. It\u2019s active restoration. Just as James\u2019 routine involves icing, hydration, and special exercises and stretches, we can all find ways to recover; pockets of rest to restore ourselves throughout the day.\n\nTaking breaks and having fun are as valuable to the creative or intellectual worker as sleep and nutrition are to the world-class athlete\n\nResting is a \u201cskill,\u201d Pang argues in Rest, when he describes the problems with our modern attitude around work:\n\nI\u2019ve argued that we should treat work and rest as equals; that we should treat rest as a skill; that the best, most restorative kinds of rest are active; and that when practiced well, rest can make us more creative and productive, without forcing us into a funhouse mirror of endless work and ever-rising expectations. A life that takes rest seriously is not only a more creative life. When we take the right to rest, when we make rest fulfilling, and when we practice rest through our days and years, we also make our lives richer and more fulfilling.\n\nThat\u2019s why taking breaks and having fun are as valuable to the creative or intellectual worker as sleep and nutrition are to the world-class athlete: Rest isn\u2019t just the well of physical recovery, it\u2019s also the spring of insight.\n\nHow to live a restful life\n\nThe psychological benefit of seeing rest as a skill or a habit to build, as opposed to a mere necessity, is that you\u2019ll feel more in charge. Pang has several ideas as to how to make this mental shift:\n\nPang\u2019s \u201cdeliberate rest\u201d concept suggests that by developing it as a mindset, \u201cyou\u2019ll start treating work and leisure as two sides of one coin: living a good, happy, meaningful life.\u201d Instead of seeing downtime as a forced retreat from the default of busy, you\u2019ll start looking for pockets of calm everywhere. Recovery never stops, remember?\n\nOnce you adopt this practice, it turns out you can rest in lots of situations. You can meditate on the subway or observe your fellow riders, rather than send emails or listen to a podcast on 1.5x speed. You can walk to your coworker\u2019s desk instead of calling them, or simply look out the window from your desk and let your mind wander. All of this is rest \u2014 and it\u2019s empowering.\n\nAll you need to know\n\nWorld-class athletes like James learn to value a good night\u2019s sleep early in their careers. They have to. Pushing their body to its physical limits has a price.\n\nThose in less physical professions may not feel the consequences of creative or intellectual work as immediately or explicitly, so to them sleep and other means of recovery might appear to be obstacles on the path to success.\n\nIn reality, our biggest roadblock is our inability to let go of this idea. Sometimes the fastest way to gain new perspective and move forward is to take a step back, divert our attention, and let ideas sit. When we cling to our work too desperately, we\u2019ll miss the very moments we most desire from it.\n\nOnly if we embrace rest as one half of a balanced scale can we truly perform our best, think our best, and live our best life. That requires active relaxation, which might mean working fewer hours, taking more breaks, and cultivating a hobby purely for fun.\n\nBut it also requires that we make rest a real habit and an attitude we carry within. To do that, we need to look for quiet moments \u2014 quiet thoughts, really \u2014 everywhere and all the time.\n\nIf we manage to find them, we\u2019ll build what we\u2019d like to see when we look back in our old age: not a life full of work, but one full of balance. I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s what LeBron dreams about at night.",

        "title": "Simon Sinek Says We Got Global Warming Wrong",
        "text": "Global warming has a marketing problem.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned the hard way that, unfortunately, people aren\u2019t going to just jump on the environmental bandwagon because scientists said they needed to. That\u2019s just not human nature. People need to be convinced, inspired, sold and left to feel like they\u2019ve decided to act out of their own free will and self-interest.\n\nThe majority of consumers care about how they\u2019ll directly benefit from something. And social issues are no different. We\u2019re just not that selfless \u2014 not on a global scale.\n\nWe\u2019ve done a poor job at marketing the climate crisis to selfish human beings. We\u2019ve confused people with poor messaging and we\u2019ve assumed that people\u2019s better nature would lead them to act selflessly. Wrong.\n\nSinek proposes two fundamental changes to our climate crisis messaging strategy:\n\nFrom global warming to climate cancer\n\nIn 1975, US Scientist, Wallace Broecker, used the term \u201cglobal warming\u201d in a scientific paper, and the rest is history. The term became part of our global lexicon, and the results were\u2026 confusing.\n\nIf it\u2019s colder this winter than it was last winter, or if it\u2019s unseasonably cold today, how can global warming be real?! \u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2026 those scientists are a bunch of liberal quacks.\u201d\n\nPeople aren\u2019t just ignorant. We\u2019re bad at messaging.\n\nThe problem was never just warming \u2014 it was about a disruption in the normal, habitable range of our planet\u2019s climate. Or, as Sinek says, the problem isn\u2019t global warming, it\u2019s climate cancer.\n\nWe need to communicate exactly what the problem is in a way that people will immediately understand and emotionally feel. People get cancer. They understand the concept. They feel the need to act. And they understand what almost always happens to a cancer patient when they fail to act: they die.\n\nThere is a cancer in our climate. And if we don\u2019t act, there will be death.\n\nBut whose death?\n\n2. From save the planet to save your family\n\nThat\u2019s Sinek\u2019s second point. We\u2019ve ignorantly believed that we could get humanity to act by telling them we need to save the earth, the animals, and some low-lying cities. But, by and large, people haven\u2019t acted.\n\nWe humans generally act in our own self-interest. Especially if it will cost us something. And healing climate cancer will cost us a lot.\n\nInstead of telling people that we need to save someone or something else, we need to warn people that they and their families are in danger. They need to know and feel the fear that failing to act will have on their own lives and those whom they love.\n\nIt\u2019s really not about the planet. It\u2019s about us. As Sinek says, \u201cThe planet will survive no matter what. Life will continue with us or without us. What we have to do is save our species.\u201d",

        "title": "Three Lessons I Learned Writing a Children\u2019s Book",
        "text": "1. Children\u2019s Books are an Incredible Art Form\n\nThere is a difference between art and everything else. If it\u2019s art, then it\u2019s worth studying. It\u2019s worth learning about. It\u2019s worth watching or viewing over and over again. If it\u2019s not \u201cart\u201d then why bother?\n\nThere is a difference between my home videos and my favorite film. I\u2019m the only one interested in videos of my kids, but millions are interested in the best films.\n\nMaybe my years studying film, both in college and attending film school, had distorted my view of art. I only studied what everyone else said was the best. I watched 48 of the 53 Hitchcock films (that\u2019s all I could find). I binge watch directors I like: Kurosawa, Kubrick, Gilliam, and others. It\u2019s because they create \u201cart\u201d while everyone else is just making movies.\n\nFor years I discounted children\u2019s books. As a new dad, I wasn\u2019t impressed by the books people bought for our kids as gifts. They seemed too simplistic. Too childish. One was a list of textures. Another was a book version of peek-a-boo. I wondered how much creativity it takes to create those kinds of books. I kind of settled into my opinion that the best books \u2014 works of true art \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be available to my children until they were much older.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI now realize that there are incredible artists creating amazing art \u2014 for children. I just didn\u2019t see what was right in front of me. As I wrote my own story, I realized that a short story is often harder to write than a long one. I had to think so carefully about every word choice. Even though my book for children is short, the editor I hired marked up my first draft like it was a bad term paper.\n\nThen I started having conversations with illustrators. One woman I spoke with told me she had always wanted to be a children\u2019s book illustrator. That was her dream. She was a brilliant artist. She was intentionally creating art for children with her gifts.\n\nI started speaking with friends who had kids \u2014 many of them had favorite children\u2019s books. They were passionate about some of the books. I was seriously missing out on some great works of art \u2014 children\u2019s books.\n\nI learned I needed to stop judging the form of the art and start enjoying some of the brilliant works of art that are being created for children.\n\n2. Selling Joy Is One of the Best Things You Can Sell\n\nWhy would someone buy my book? That\u2019s the question that I had to answer if I were actually going to write and sell a children\u2019s book. I didn\u2019t have a good answer initially. I just knew that I had to write the book.\n\nThirteen drafts later, I had a draft ready for illustrations. No one had read the manuscript except for my wife and two editors. It was time to send this creation out into the wild.\n\nI sent a copy to one of my best friends. I asked him to read it to his five kids and see what they thought. I waited patiently, as my own children were the only kids who had heard the story. Would other kids laugh? Would they like it?\n\nLater that night, I received a message (copied nearly verbatim).\n\nJust read it to the kids\u2026 GREATTTT JOBBB!!!!!\n\nHysterical laughing\u2026 asked kids do you think this could sell\u2026 split second two oldest said \u201cyes!\u201d\n\nDuring it my wife was shouting\u2026 gross\u2026 what is this\u2026 I said Mashni wrote it\u2026 she was like what you are kidding\u2026 I said nope\u2026 she was like what?!?! lollll\n\nAnd then he ended with this statement that changed how I viewed the book:\n\nThank you for giving me 30 minutes of pure laughter with my kids.\n\nIn that last statement, I found the answer to why someone would buy my book. I was not selling a book anymore. I was not selling physical paper or a Kindle file. I was not even selling a story. When you sit down to read my story, you will laugh. Your kids will laugh. The laughter will last longer than the book.\n\nWhat was I selling? I was going to sell 30 minutes of joy with a child. What is that worth? How much would someone pay for that? I know that for me and my own children, it is priceless.\n\nIn a world where no one knows what life will look like in a year or even a month, those moments of joy are the best parts of life. I\u2019ve thought for years about different types of businesses I could start and different products I could sell. Right now, though, I\u2019m not sure there is anything else I would rather be selling. By writing CinderToot, I learned that selling joy is one of the best things you could ever sell.\n\n3. Inspiring Kids Is Honorable\n\nI soon asked other people to read the manuscript. At a family gathering, I read the story to my nieces and nephew. I could barely finish as they interrupted with laughter.\n\nI learned something new about writing a children\u2019s book, though, from my niece that day. After I finished the story, she disappeared for a few minutes. When she came back into the room, she had her own paper and pencil and started writing. I asked her what she was doing, and her response floored me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing my own version of CinderToot. I want to write my own children\u2019s book, like you.\u201d\n\nI did not understand how my crazy idea would change my own life, but I did not expect it to change anyone else\u2019s life. I almost teared up as I realized that listening to my story inspired her to create something of her own. I learned that telling my stories could inspire young people, and we need that inspiration more than ever.\n\nWhat I Learned\n\nI\u2019m only limited by my imagination now, and not by the worries of what others will think or how they will react.\n\nI am excited to take what I\u2019ve learned and apply it to the next book.\n\nChildren\u2019s books are an incredible art form. Selling joy is one of the best things you can sell. Inspiring children is honorable.\n\nI can\u2019t wait for the lessons I will learn from the next book and others after.",

        "text": "This enabled the DRC to map the optimal areas suitable to cultivate the African oil palm. It was possible thanks to tracking and finding an array of suitable measures: Temperature ranges (24\u201328\u00b0C), rainfall per year (2000\u20132500mm), soil types (high clay content, or loam and silt dominated soils), and soil constraints (flat areas to lessen the effects of erosion and fertilizer runoff).\n\nCreated map showing the pilot REDD+ projects (yellow) that aim at Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation; created among protected areas and indigenous lands while taking into account palm oil cultivation suitability.\n\nHowever, these optimal or highly suitable areas also cover large intact forests, home to a rich biodiversity and many indigenous groups. Indeed, the question of finding suitable areas for cultivation becomes a multi-faceted problem where many other factors determine which parts should be cleared for palm oil cultivation.\n\nMathieu Shamavu poses for a photo with the orphaned gorillas Nkakazi and Ndeze. Photograph: Mathieu Shamavu/AP\n\nMany mammal species would no longer find their homes. Apart from humans, the Gorilla, the Pan, and even the Okapi. Naturally, the ecological diversity doesn\u2019t stop at mammals and efforts for conservation are much needed as poaching, illegal forest clearance loom over an ever decreasing natural habitat. The palm oil cultivation story can be found as a scrolly report with interactive maps and notes.\n\nIt is alarming that the human use of many ecosystems is too great a burden for the forces of nature to be able to heal itself. As a consequence, the previously described habitats will change fundamentally. This ranges from change in the diversity of organisms to changes in their interactions. Forests are being converted into agricultural land, oil palm plantations are displacing tropical rainforests, and the fate of more soil is being sealed.\n\nThis leads to stress on the invisible threads that connect each organism in an environment. When organisms are deprived of survival conditions, their ability to adapt to different conditions is overtaxed. The effects of the changing global and regional climate contribute to this phenomenon.\n\nAlthough about 11 million species have been described by biologists, it is likely there are many more unknown species, particularly in the oceans and the large rainforest areas. This is even more so the case for microbes that live out of sight. Scientists estimate that we\u2019ve only discovered one tenth of all species on Earth. A question comes to mind: How many unknown species have already been affected by the effects of global and regional climate? In the oceans, research is difficult as everything is naturally dynamic and ocean exploration is challenging.\n\nLearning about the deep sea and the large rainforests is today made easier by technology. Years ago, people could only marvel and wonder at the secrets of these habitats. While rainforest exploration has been limited by the challenges of hot and humid conditions, the dense canopy cover, the remoteness, and the sheer diversity of species; in the oceans, underwater diving has been limiting human exploration. However, unmanned vehicles could enable long term exploration of the depths to gather and collect data to better understand living organisms that contribute to the exchange of matter.\n\nThe example of mapping data that pertain to finding suitable palm oil cultivation areas and their visualization helped bring forth a greater understanding for conservation and land use planning. On a larger scale, this train of thought could help unravel the world\u2019s critical ecosystems. Indeed, every data point matters, from part to whole on the threads of a much larger spiderweb.",

        "text": "Reality, Augmented? How to Drive Adoption of What\u2019s Next\n\nIf new mediums take off only when they fundamentally change our everyday life, what are the daily implications of augmented reality? What are some principles for the adoption of new mediums?\n\nOn the prospects of augmented reality, opinions vary widely in my conversations with fellow investors, designers, and technologists. Many investors consider the space \u201cmany years away,\u201d \u201cun-investable,\u201d \u201cnot practical,\u201d and \u201cfar from certain.\u201d At the same time, the designers and developers building the platform and authoring products for the space believe it is \u201cinevitable,\u201d \u201ctransformative,\u201d and poised to change our everyday life as we know it \u2014 sooner than we think.\n\nSince the best investors are most persuaded by present trends (rather than potential future trends), it is no surprise that augmented reality may be a bit far off to elicit excitement. Until it is clear which platforms (Apple, Google, Microsoft\u2026perhaps even start-ups like Magic Leap) will dominate this new medium, it is difficult to invest with confidence. But among the most knowledgeable designers and technologists in the space, there is no question.\n\nSo what can product teams do to accelerate adoption \u2014 for AR specifically and new technology in general? First, always \u201cshow not tell,\u201d with the use of prototypes and presumptive visualizations. Just putting something out there can solicit a ton of feedback and accelerate progress. And then consider a set of general principles for the adoption of new behaviors and products.\n\nIn the spirit of a prototype being worth a thousand meetings (or too verbose medium posts!), my team developed a short video to explore how our everyday actions will be enhanced \u2014 and in some ways transformed \u2014 as augmented reality is broadly adopted. Have a look:\n\nOf course, setting a vision that drives alignment \u2014 as imperfect and rough as it may be \u2014 is just the first step. To really drive adoption in the first phase of a new product or medium, there are a few principles I think about a lot:\n\nNovelty Precedes Utility : Transformative and mission critical technology tends to be used for more lighthearted and fun purposes in the first inning. This principle is especially true for consumer products but even applies to the enterprise. I recall my team at Behance being on HipChat and using the first version of Slack to share GIFs and jokes. The rest is history. For an emerging medium like AR, it is no surprise that games and other fun novelties (like lenses in Snap and Instagram) are the first applications. Don\u2019t misinterpret these applications as the limits of a new medium, they are merely the kindling.\n\n: Transformative and mission critical technology tends to be used for more lighthearted and fun purposes in the first inning.

Outfit The Artists : Artists are best equipped to socialize (and help us appreciate) the edges of life \u2014 whether it is policy, technology, fashion, or culture in general. Artists are dreamers and risk-takers. To showcase what\u2019s possible in a new medium, outfit artists with authoring tools and make them interoperable with the tools they already use \u2014 and the content they\u2019ve already made. This is a crucial part of the strategy we\u2019re taking at Adobe with products like Adobe Aero, which enables people to build interactive AR scenes with 3D objects and bring their PSD\u2019s into AR \u2014 expanding the layers to create depth, etc.\n\n: Artists are best equipped to socialize (and help us appreciate) the edges of life \u2014 whether it is policy, technology, fashion, or culture in general.

Early developers will leverage the early UI/UX decisions you make and coast on any familiarity established by the early reference apps. On a related note, beware of creativity that compromises familiarity \u2014 the early days of adoption are all about familiar patterns.\n\n: Just as the original apps on the iPhone (1st party (Apple) apps) set the bit for developers on how to build and design their own apps, the design and functionality of the early apps for a new medium are super important.

Obsess Over The First Mile : Ironically, most product teams only spend the last mile of their experience building the product thinking about the first mile of the customer\u2019s experience using the product. This is especially ironic given the fact that the only part of the product every customer experiences is the first mile! I\u2019ve written quite a bit about crafting the first mile of product experience, and why, as my friend Dave Morin likes to say, \u201cthe devil\u2019s in the defaults.\u201d For new products and mediums, nail the onboarding.\n\n: Ironically, most product teams only spend the last mile of their experience building the product thinking about the first mile of the customer\u2019s experience using the product.

Engage The Right Customers At The Right Time: If you have the luxury of doing so (start-ups can, big companies cannot), engage the cohort of willing and forgiving customers first \u2014 before aiming to engage every customer you can find. The old \u201ctake any customer you can get\u201d adage is short-sighted, because the customers you have at different stages of your business impact how your product evolves and how your team prioritizes.\n\nOf course, for augmented reality in particular, the prospects are dependent on hardware, advances in artificial intelligence, and software. But I believe we\u2019re getting closer on all three fronts, and the approach we take to drive customer adoption can very much accelerate the whole space.\n\nAugmented Reality is particularly interesting to me because of its potential to bridge the physical and digital worlds \u2014 as opposed to constrain us to one or the other. For millennia, we lived solely in the physical world. Then we invented a digital world and for the past 25 years it has increasingly entranced us. With smartphones, we see people all the time looking down at their screens and ignoring the physical world around them. It\u2019s concerning, and I believe AR done well will synthesize the physical and digital worlds and enhance our interactions with both. In some ways, it could bring us back to a balanced way of living in the physical world despite being in the digital era.\n\nAs a result, I\u2019ll bet that screen sales will look a lot like traditional camera sales as immersive experiences and devices go mainstream. Less \u201cscreen time\u201d as we know it today may be a good thing.",

        "text": "After voluntarily entering self-isolation three days ago, I\u2019ve come to a startling discovery.\n\nWorking from home, barely seeing people, meetings over Skype and phone, very little human contact\u2026 I have been voluntarily self-isolating for the better part of three years of my life.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert who runs her own businesses from home, and I really thrive on working alone and not having a lot of human interaction throughout my workday.\n\nAnd up until now, I\u2019ve been exceptionally content with that arrangement, each day for the last several years.\n\nSince the coronavirus outbreak, and Canada going into voluntary self-isolation as a country, the only real change is that my husband is now also working from home. He\u2019s in his basement office, I\u2019m on the top floor in my everyday office. We occasionally cross paths in the kitchen during a workday.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that outwardly and logistically my life has not changed AT ALL since the coronavirus outbreak. Everything for me should be business as usual.\n\nAnd yet, everything has changed.\n\nI\u2019m an anxious mess. I\u2019m exhausted all the time, focusing on work is harder than ever before, and I feel more drained than I have in years.\n\nThat is why I am here to tell you, friends and readers who are now working from home and beating yourselves up for feeling exhausted or unproductive all the time, no, you\u2019re not lazy.\n\nWhat you\u2019re feeling is entirely normal, and completely reasonable.\n\nAnd here\u2019s why:",

        "title": "This Is What It\u2019s Like to Eat Your Last Meal and Think About Never Waking Up Again",
        "text": "This annual trip to the hospital started in 2015 when I felt a little off. I saw my doctor and he told me it was nothing and to take vitamin pills. My girlfriend at the time told me to get a second opinion. I refused for six months until, finally, she forced me to see her family doctor.\n\nThe new doc\u2019s advice was similar: \u201cit\u2019s probably nothing. But\u2026\u201d\n\nWhenever you see a doctor be careful of the \u201cbut.\u201d They always have something else to say and their goal is to keep you calm. The but in my case was that the doctor wanted to send me to hospital for a guided tour around my insides.\n\nMost people wouldn\u2019t care too much. For me, I\u2019m petrified of hospitals and medical procedures. Going to hospital is like standing on the edge of a cliff face with no harness, while a tornado twirls around a few feet away. This means I have to prepare my mind.\n\nHere is a list of things I do to face one of the scariest moments of my life:\n\nNo phones or social media\n\nPhones and social media create stress. I can\u2019t deal with my hospital reality and serve my phone master. So, phones go off and social media goes unanswered. At best, social media posts get scheduled.\n\nBut content creation stops before hospital out of respect to what might happen if anything goes wrong. You won\u2019t be looking at your twitter account on the last day of your life; you\u2019ll be thinking about those you love.\n\nChristmas movies for joy reminders\n\nThe thought of santa and presents under a tree equals joy. It takes me back to childhood. It helps remind me of the pleasure of giving rather than receiving. It\u2019s a pure time of year. Everything makes sense.\n\nYou sit with family, be grateful for what you have, and eat a meal. Each year the table of relatives gets smaller as people pass away. One year you have grandma, and next year you don\u2019t. Christmas used to be for religious folks.\n\nNow the universal language of Christmas is joy. You can be an atheist and use Christmas as an excuse to be grateful and feel joy.\n\nIt turns out gratitude and joy are excellent right before hospital, too. So, I watch Christmas movies leading up to hospital to put me in state.\n\nInjecting calm into the mind\n\nHospital equals fear. The opposite of fear is calmness.\n\nThe good news is you can manufacture calmness in your life when you need it most. I manufacture calm like this:\n\nDeep breathing\n\nGetting sunshine\n\nAudio in my ears that tells me everything is going to be okay. (I choose Tony Robbins\u2019 voice.)\n\nThe superpower of overpreparation\n\nTwo days before hospital I go into lockdown. I start to overprepare so that on the day of hospital I don\u2019t have to do anything or stress about a single thing. Overpreparation helps alleviate stress.\n\nI pack my backpack with everything I might need while in the hospital. I take lots of water, comfortable clothes, headphones for calming audio, and tissues.\n\nOne thing I don\u2019t take is time. Time in the hospital moves differently. When you\u2019re fearful time either slows down or speeds up. For me, my thoughts speed up, but an hour feels like 12 hours. Looking at the time makes me more nervous.\n\nI start mapping out in my mind what time I get dressed into my scrubs, then what time I meet the nurse to undergo a health check, then the scary moment when the anesthetist comes into the room and tries to explain to me what is going to happen, even though I\u2019d do anything not to know.\n\nYou have a lot of time to live. But time in the hospital feels different and it should. Hospital is where you go to repair your body from all the damage you and the world throw at it.\n\nAbsolutely no 9\u20135 work whatsoever\n\n9\u20135 work stresses me out the most. Already, my work colleagues are trying to schedule meetings right after I get out of hospital. It\u2019s for this reason that I refuse to engage in any traditional work leading up to the hospital.\n\nThinking about customers while I contemplate the beauty of consciousness destroys my happiness.\n\nThe work phone gets left far, far away in a distant galaxy. The work laptop\u2019s battery is run down to empty so that it can\u2019t dare boot up on my hospital day. It sounds drastic. But in a world that is always switched on, it is increasingly hard to switch off \u2014 even for a hospital moment.",

        "text": "Facebook Is Circling the Wagons, Not the Drain\n\nIs it possible that the platform of the future might actually be *gasp* useful?\n\nPhoto by Randy Fath on Unsplash\n\nJared A. Brock\u2019s popular story extolling Facebook\u2019s demise presents a believable, well-documented case for the social media giant\u2019s terminal condition. He almost had me convinced.\n\nHe\u2019s right about those under the age of 18. They aren\u2019t scrolling or even trolling. Half of the millennials bailed on Facebook for social purposes years ago. Gen X and the Boomers are still there. But as Jared surmised, 2021 will see millions exit the newsfeeds, where people spent 2020 in fierce word battles with strangers over their far left or right views.\n\nWhat he\u2019s missing is that it may only be the newsfeed these people are shunning. They may stay for the groups and possibly for business pages, their own as well as those of local businesses.\n\nFacebook is banking on the group dynamic carrying them forward. Think back over the past year\u2019s commercials. They entertained viewers with kazoo groups, ex-pats in Korea, and rock buggy enthusiasts reminding us there\u2019s a community or three for almost everyone. Hootsuite estimated that there were over 10 million groups in 2019, a number that is certain to have expanded with the pandemic.\n\nThe financial sustainability of this approach remains to be seen, however, since group owners rarely spend to promote their groups and their discussions remain free of sponsored content. The first whiff of in-group advertising could send members scattering into the ether.\n\nJared may also be overlooking a key demographic: rural Americans of all ages. Let\u2019s break down the types of groups and pages that have the potential to keep Facebook relevant in the coming decade, including the one group category with the potential to generate almost painless revenue.",

        "text": "Meetings take a big chunk of our time. Yet, unlike with personal productivity, little is done to optimise them fully. Why? For two reasons:\n\nWe often are not in control of setting the meetings.\n\nEven if we are in control, no one taught us how to run valuable and energising meetings.\n\nAccording to Forbes, about 55 million meetings happen each day in the United States alone. And due to poor planning and poor execution, most of our get together feel like a waste of time: pointless distractions from the real work.\n\nWith so much of our time sucked into daily meetings, not taking care of optimising them lead to the biggest productivity loss in our organisation.\n\nThat\u2019s what Mamie Kanfer Stewart, author of Momentum: Creating Effective, Engaging and Enjoyable Meetings, seeks to address in her book. According to her, great meetings have three stages that are well defined: before, during, and after the meeting.\n\nIf you are a manager, an executive, or a worker who seeks to promote a better meetings culture, this three-stage process can help you fix poor meeting habits and get the most out of your teamwork.",

        "title": "5 Quotes by Rick Riordan to Make You a Better Writer",
        "text": "Rick Riordan (born in 1964) is the hugely popular author of the Percy Jackson series and the Heroes of Olympus series.\n\nHere are five of his quotes about writing to inspire you!\n\n1. There are days when I\u2019ll write for 15 minutes and have to give up and move around, and I\u2019ll write another paragraph and give up again. On other days I get intensely focused on the process, sit down at 8 A.M. and won\u2019t get up until 8 P.M.\n\nDoesn\u2019t it make you feel good to know someone as popular as Rick Riordan occasionally has a bad writing day where he has to give up after fifteen minutes or after a paragraph? We get these images in our heads that to be a bestselling author you have to write thousands and thousands of words every single day from 8am to 6pm, but you know what? Nothing is farther from the truth. In fact every successful writer has a different approach to their work, and every successful writer has had days when they can\u2019t get through a single sentence and when they feel like frauds.\n\nNot every day of writing is going to go great, but the road to becoming a successful writer starts with showing up every day. See where the work takes you. Do your best. If you can only get down 500 good words for the day, that\u2019s still a huge accomplishment. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything less. If you want to have the occasional inspired day where you work from 8am to 8pm like Riordan sometimes does? Then go for it! There\u2019s no wrong way to write as long as you\u2019re getting some new words down for the day.\n\n2. For me, writing for kids is harder because they\u2019re a more discriminating audience. While adults might stay with you, if you lose your pacing or if you have pages of extraneous description, a kid\u2019s not going to do that. They will drop the book.\n\nAs a young adult author, I think about this all the time when I\u2019m working on my latest novel, especially during the revision process. Although you should tell your story the way it needs to be told and not alter it necessarily to suit the needs of your audience, you should absolutely look for sections that might read slow and then ask yourself what needs to stay and what possibly can go.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely true that adults will stick with you longer than kids, but nobody will stick with your book if they find it to be boring. There are a lot of books out there, and your reader will only stick around if they believe you know what you\u2019re doing as the author and they believe you\u2019ve got an engrossing story to tell that won\u2019t let them down. You have to bring it every time, whether you\u2019re writing for kids or adults. You need to grip your reader from the beginning and never let them go.\n\n3. All of my characters tend to be montages of different people I\u2019ve met: little bits and pieces of their personalities put together.\n\nI tend to create characters in this manner too, although sometimes I\u2019ll create an original character out of thin air that really doesn\u2019t feel like any person I\u2019ve met before. Sometimes you want to challenge yourself to get creative with your characters, with how they see the world, with what they\u2019re passionate about and want out of life. It gets dull to write the same kind of person over and over, and it can get tiresome to just think about people close to you in your life you can pick and choose details from.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re stuck on what the characters might be like in your latest story, it doesn\u2019t hurt to think about people you\u2019ve met in recent months and see what traits you might be able to use for a story. Sometimes you\u2019ll bump into a person who already feels like a character in a story, so you kind of have to put them into a fictional world. But use your imagination, too. Don\u2019t just transplant somebody into your story using every specific detail about their appearance and physicality and voice and way of speaking. Be like Riordan and use a montage of various people you\u2019ve met in your latest character creation. That will probably be of more use to you in the long run.\n\n4. I\u2019ve always found the second book in a series is the hardest to write.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about writing series, which Riordan is of course used to, with his hugely successful Percy Jackson series, as well as some other series he\u2019s penned in the last few years. The man pumps out one escapist book after another that kids and adults alike love to read, and one of the reasons they love to read Riordan\u2019s work is that he often writes series. Instead of stand-alone novels, which can be satisfying in their own ways, series offer readers the opportunity to spend time with characters they love for long periods of time. Series, with occasional exceptions, are what truly sell in the world of books.\n\nAnd for any of you looking to find success, there are worse ways to do so than to write a series. Keep in mind you have to be smart in your approach. You need to find a story that could potentially be a series of three or more books, and you want that story to be so compelling you\u2019ll have the motivation and desire and interest to stick with it and with those characters for many books. I\u2019ve written two trilogies in my life, and both were absolute blasts to write. I was, however, perfectly happy to conclude the stories in the third books, and I haven\u2019t ever attempted a series that went beyond book three.\n\nHaving said that, Riordan is absolutely right in that the second book is often the hardest one to write. Book one is hard because you have to establish everybody and make the ending satisfying for the reader just in case they choose to not continue to another installment, but book two is extra hard because now you have to give the readers something they liked before but also take them someplace new. Even more difficult, you have to in many ways top what you did before and at the same time compel your reader by the end to go onto a third book, possibly a fourth or fifth book. When you\u2019re writing a series, book one is important but in some ways book two is even more so because that\u2019s really where you hook the reader to continue\u2026 or you don\u2019t.\n\n5. It\u2019s always hard to wrap up a series. The longer I spend with the characters, the more they become like friends.\n\nAs I said, I enjoyed writing two young adult trilogies, and I especially had fun with those third books knowing they were the definitive end. But it can be hard to reach the end, as Riordan says, because you\u2019ve spent more time in that world and with those characters. When you write a single stand-alone novel, those characters live with you for a long time, but when you write a series, those characters are with you for years, sometimes decades.\n\nMany authors write in a series they love, and they never stop writing it until they die, only for someone else to pick up the mantle and continue writing more books in that world. I totally get that. If you love writing a series and after awhile those characters become real and almost family to you, and readers out there are loving the series and want you to produce more books, why not just keep going? If there are more stories to tell, and there\u2019s not necessarily a clear endpoint, why not write thirty books in a series or more? That\u2019s kind of the dream for me, really. Although I will always want to write the occasional stand-alone book, my dream is finding that perfect series I could write for decades that readers adore and want me to never stop.\n\nWhatever place you are in your writing life, don\u2019t be afraid of writing a series if you have an amazing idea for something that could exist long beyond a single title. Remember that in the world of traditional publishing, it\u2019s best you only write the first book and try to sell that, rather than write five books in a row and then try to sell the entire series. In the world of self-publishing? All bets are off. Write ten books in a series if you want, and if they become successful, keep going. Whatever you do, don\u2019t write a series only for the money, in a genre you think is popular but you don\u2019t care for that much. Your readers will sniff that out right away.\n\nInstead be passionate about what you write, whether it\u2019s a stand-alone or a series, whether it\u2019s a story written for kids or adults, and you\u2019ll never have to work a day in your life.",

        "title": "An Experiment in Creating a Writing Income Stream on Amazon",
        "text": "I had an epiphany recently.\n\nMy daughter told me that she\u2019d read that short-reads do well on Amazon. Especially in Kindle Unlimited. And that made sense to me. Amazon is basically a giant search engine.\n\nIn fact, I realized, writing for Kindle Unlimited is very similar to writing on Medium.\n\nOnly there\u2019s the whole search engine thing. People search for what they want to read on Amazon, where on Medium we basically read what we\u2019re served up.\n\nThe pay system is similar: a subscription-based model where writers are paid for page reads. Only, we can also sell our work directly, earning a royalty.\n\nOf course there are limitations. Amazon isn\u2019t a blog. Medium is. But it\u2019s possible to build a body of work there that helps with audience building and creates an income stream.\n\nAnd that writers have a little more control over than they do writing on Medium.\n\nI\u2019m still a fan of Medium.\n\nI think it works well as a blog, so far. It\u2019s volatile, though. Changeable in a way that\u2019s disconcerting to me. Without much transparency, all of a sudden things are different and that affects my income in a way that is very frustrating.\n\nSo, I have a theory that I\u2019m excited to test.\n\nI think that expanded blog posts \u2014 5000 words or less \u2014 posted on Amazon as ebooks could become a decent income stream.\n\nI\u2019m going to experiment with that over the next year. Here are the parameters of my experiment so far:\n\nMy goal is to publish at least one non-fiction short to Amazon every week.\n\nMy books will be 5000 words or fewer. (Book isn\u2019t really the right word.)\n\nI think that posts that are deep dives that answer a specific question will do best, so I\u2019ll focus on that.\n\nI\u2019m going to start with blog posts I\u2019ve already written and work on expanding and deepening them.\n\nI plan to use SEO and try to write titles and use keywords that people will search for on Amazon and on Google.\n\nI\u2019m going to focus on writing about writing and productivity at first, but I\u2019m excited to expand beyond that eventually.\n\nI\u2019m committing to trying this for a year.\n\nMy first goal is to earn $100 per month within 90 days.\n\nI\u2019m starting a focus group in a couple of weeks of Ninja Writers who interested in trying this experiment as well. If you want to be notified when that starts and how to join, click here.\n\nOne thing we\u2019ll be doing, very soon, is experimenting with challenges. I\u2019ve been developing a system for planning, writing, editing, and publishing these shorts that can be repeated over and over.\n\nI\u2019ll update you on how it\u2019s going.

        "title": "The Pre-Writing Work That Will Make Blogging So Much Easier",
        "text": "There are 13 days left before the writing part of the Blog-Your-Own-Book Challenge starts. I\u2019m going to give you homework tonight that you might hate me for now, but you\u2019ll really thank me for it later.\n\nFirst, a story.\n\nI\u2019m a novelist. Before my first novel was published, I wrote three novels that were not. I was a straight-up pantser when I wrote those books. I was sure plotting would eat my story\u2019s soul. That it would make it impossible for me to write my book the way I wanted to.\n\nAfter my first novel was published, my editor did something that changed the way I write forever. She asked me to send her a synopsis for a novel I hadn\u2019t written yet.\n\nAnd she expected it by the end of the month.\n\nI had to learn to plot. Fast. I did and the result was a book that A) was the best thing I\u2019d written up to that date and B) I was able to write in one quarter of the time I was used to taking. One quarter.\n\nI\u2019ve plotted every book I\u2019ve ever written since then. I\u2019ve never looked back.\n\nThe PSST Framework is Like Blog-Post Plotting\n\nAll of that is to say that I use a framework for my blog posts for the same reason I plot my novels. It\u2019s faster. It\u2019s so much easier. And, it turns out, it\u2019s actually pretty fun.\n\nI like thinking about my blog posts and imagining what they might be.\n\nPSST stands for Premise, Story, Subheads, and Take-away.\n\nI actually have a page in my Rocketbook that I used a Sharpie on to make a form that I literally fill out before I write each post.\n\nThe PSST page in my Rocketbook. Photo: Author\n\nI use a Frixion pen to fill out the form for every post. A little water erases it, but leaves the Sharpie template. If I end up not actually writing my post that day or I want to create a bunch of PSST forms for posts, I just take a picture of them. Like the one above, which is for a post I didn\u2019t actually write. Yet.\n\nThe parts are so simple. Let me break it down for you.\n\nPremise\n\nPremise is just a \u2018p\u2019 for \u2018working title\u2019 \u2014 because I thought PSST Framework was cute.\n\nJust write what your post is about in a few words. Don\u2019t be cute or clever. Think newspaper headline. You need to be able to look back on your post framework and know what you were wanting to talk about.\n\nThis is a good exercise, too, because simple, clear, concise titles do well for blog posts.\n\nStory\n\nI firmly believe that every every blog post should start with a story. In the first \u2018S\u2019 box on my form, I write a sentence or two about which story I\u2019ll tell in that particular post.\n\nI write enough to remind myself of the story I want to tell, but really only a few words. I don\u2019t spend too much time here and I pretty much never second guess myself. If I get ready to write and a better story comes to me, I write that one instead. But most of the time, my instincts are pretty good.\n\nI bet yours are, too. We\u2019re storytellers. Trust that.\n\nSubheads\n\nThis is pretty much the body of your post in a series of sentences.\n\nJust think about what you want to say about your premise. It helps me to ask myself \u2018what is the first thing some one needs to know\u2019 and then I ask \u2018and then what\u2019 until I reach the end.\n\nTake-Away\n\nYour take-away is the way you end your post. What do you want your readers to take from it? What do you want them to do after they read your post? How do you want to change them?\n\nYour Homework\n\nOkay, so a few days ago I asked you to come up with your 31 posts for your BYOB Project.\n\nIn the next 13 days, before August 1, I want you to use the PSST framework on each one of your 31 posts. It shouldn\u2019t take you too long. It takes me less than ten minutes to use the framework on my own posts every day.\n\nI\u2019m actually using Dabble to keep track of and plan my posts. I created a system there for managing all my PSST work on every post in one place. You can read about that here.\n\nYou can also download a PSST Framework worksheet here.",

        "title": "It\u2019s Not \u2018Writer\u2019s Block\u2019 \u2014 It\u2019s Emptiness.",
        "text": "The phrase \u2018Writer\u2019s Block\u2019 looms over all of us who dare to pick up a pen or tap out sentences on our computers. It suggests that we, the writer, have hit an impasse \u2014 we\u2019ve strained too hard, or squeezed out every inch of creativity we had, with nothing left. Well, I have a confession to make\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think writer\u2019s block exists.\n\nRecently, I read the fantastic Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott. In it, she talks about so-called \u2018writer\u2019s block\u2019, and describes it like this \u2014\n\n\u201cIf your wife locks you out of the house, you don\u2019t have a problem with your door. The word \u2018block\u2019 suggests that you are constipated or stuck, when the truth is that you\u2019re empty\u2026\u201d\n\nIn the classic The Artist\u2019s Way, Julia Cameron also describes it not as a \u2018block\u2019 but as a \u2018drought\u2019 \u2014\n\n\u201cIn any creative life there are dry seasons. These droughts appear from nowhere and stretch to the horizon\u2026 our work feels mechanical, empty, forced.\u201d\n\nThere it is again: emptiness.\n\nIt\u2019s time to refuel.\n\nAcceptance first, action second\n\nThe issue, much of the time, is that we are taught that all creative people \u2014 truly talented or capable writers \u2014 must always be writing. This ridiculous notion ensures we place pressure on ourselves to always be producing something (and normally not just \u2018something\u2019 but \u2018something good\u2019). The reality is, nobody is like this.\n\nBack to Lamott, and her wise words:\n\n\u201cThe problem is acceptance, which is something we\u2019re taught not to do. We\u2019re taught to improve uncomfortable situations, to change things\u2026 but if you accept the reality that you have been given \u2014 that you are not in a productive creative period \u2014 you free yourself to begin filling up again.\u201d\n\nAs creatives, there is the notion that the act of creation is essential to our being. That means demanding creativity at any and all moments from ourselves, in order to keep proving (to ourselves or others) that we are, in fact, the \u2018real deal\u2019.\n\nThe notion of acceptance, as Lamott describes it, doesn\u2019t generally factor in. Gentleness isn\u2019t really a trait associated with \u2018genius\u2019 and if we\u2019re honest, that is what many of us aspire to be. The entire concept of \u2018genius\u2019 comes round to hurt us, more than help.\n\nFreeing ourselves to simply be who we are \u2014 creatives, yes, but also many other things \u2014 acknowledges the fact that we will require more than our creativity to keep us going. We might need to nurture other parts of ourselves. Because while our creativity is important and is likely essential to many of us, it cannot be everything. Some people enjoy being workaholics, or are very dedicated to one aspect of their lives. But that doesn\u2019t have to be you, and your creativity will likely benefit from a little diversity, a little gentleness, and a little openness.\n\nIt starts with acceptance: you might not be in your most creative phase right now. That\u2019s okay. Free yourself by acknowledging this honestly and openly. Give yourself the chance to address it.\n\nRead widely, and embrace your uniqueness\n\nPart of the problem with the idea of \u2018writer\u2019s block\u2019 is that it suggests you have moved as far as you can, and now your path is being obstructed. If only you could jump the hurdle and continue moving forward in that unendingly direct and efficient forward momentum! It says we should be moving in that linear motion at all times. What does this even mean in the context of creativity?\n\nWhen we hear stories about famous writers who did supposedly work in this mythically perfect fashion, it can create a blank in us. For me, it was the story I heard about Tolkien. As a young woman who adored Lord of the Rings, I had heard that Tolkien simply sat down at his typewriter and churned out the epic, all of it coming clear and easy to his fingers.\n\nI doubt that this story is at all true. But it didn\u2019t matter: I was influenced. If I can\u2019t also sit down and execute a string of perfect sentences, plot and character emerging naturally at first attempt, then I must not be a \u2018real\u2019 writer. I must be a fraud.\n\nIn Francine Prose\u2019s essential Reading Like A Writer, she says:\n\n\u201cSome writers stop you dead in your tracks by making you see your own work in the most unflattering light. Each of us will meet a different harbinger of personal failure, some innocent genius chosen by us for reasons having to do with what we see as our own inadequacies. The only remedy to this I have found is to read a writer whose work is entirely different from another, though not necessarily more like your own \u2014 a difference that will remind you of how many rooms there are in the house of art.\u201d\n\nCreativity isn\u2019t linear. It isn\u2019t \u2018efficient\u2019. There is no one way to \u2018do\u2019 creativity. Obviously, there isn\u2019t just one kind of writing. You could read any number of books, different and wonderful in equal measure. And you probably already do! Returning to the love of reading here is important \u2014 if we are empty, we need to refuel. We can refuel by finding inspiration. We can find inspiration through admiration. It might be time to try new books, to try new forms of writing, new writers, to listen to new voices.\n\nAnd Prose\u2019s final sentiments are the ones I try to remind myself of: there are many, many rooms in the house of art. Perhaps my room will be a little different.\n\nHoning in on the one method to acquire the status of genius is so entirely problematic and narrow-minded as to disqualify all other attempts at creation, all of which are likely valid and helpful. Don\u2019t try to get into Tolkien\u2019s room. Go out and discover, then return to your unique place in the vast landscape of creativity.\n\nNo perfectionism, just play\n\nIn a period of emptiness, releasing perfectionism is going to be top priority in allowing you to find that unique place that is yours alone. Feeling empty, you are likely not going to do your absolute best work in these times. So, it\u2019s time to just shake things loose, and see what happens.\n\nOne reason we believe we get \u2018blocked\u2019 is due to perfectionism having the final word over everything we try to create. It helps to kill off any of those burgeoning ideas we might well have to struggle with, incubate, and toss around for a while, before they make any sense to us on the page.\n\nBack to Julia Cameron, who says \u2014\n\nDuring a drought, the mere act of showing up on the page, like the act of walking through a tackless desert, requires one footfall after another to no apparent point\u2026 What do we do? We stumble on.\n\nCameron of course pioneered the idea of the Morning Pages \u2014 three pages written first thing every morning, with no clear purpose or intention. Just whatever comes to mind. Personally, I\u2019ve tried, and I find it incredibly wearying. Instead, I write down dreams and random things that come to me in the night, and then leave it. If it\u2019s not three whole pages, that\u2019s fine. But it still serves the purpose of starting me off \u2014 of getting my brain going, and accepting that I don\u2019t need to be writing pure prize winning glory first thing in the morning. Or indeed any time of day.\n\nCameron\u2019s idea here is the important thing. We stumble on. Just get to the page, and try to see what happens. Even if it\u2019s stream of consciousness, drivel, boring, or whatever other negative word your brain can conjure up.\n\nAnd for good measure \u2014\n\nThe time in the desert brings us clarity and charity. When you are in a drought, know that it is to a purpose\u2026 To write is to right things\u2026 A path will emerge.\n\nI like this a lot. To write is to right things \u2014 we have to work through it. Throw something onto the page and see what sticks. Forget about declaring anything your magnum opus.\n\nJeff Vandermeer\u2019s very colourful and fun Wonderbook adds \u2014\n\n\u201cDifferent forces are at work today with regard to the imagination. Modern ideals of functionality and the trend towards seamless design in our technology have taken the very human striving for perfection and given us the illusion of having attained it (which, ironically, seems very dehumanizing). In this environment, some writers second-guess their instincts and devalue the sense of play that infuses creative endeavours\u2026\u201d\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d argue this tendency goes back much further than the modern day and the impacts of technology \u2014 it\u2019s imbedded in ancient Western aesthetic ideals, from the desire to create \u2018perfect\u2019 and eternal structures in cement, through to today.\n\nVandermeer, however, rightly suggests play as the most important thing we can allow the mind to engage in, as it \u201cleads to making the connections necessary to create narrative.\u201d This is a rather prosaic way to put it, but it\u2019s true. Without the chance for the brain to spark, where will we get our stories? We need the chance to form connections, to turn things over in a new light, and to let the mind work its own magic. That brings me to my last point\u2026\n\nRest is not optional\n\nYour brain needs a minute to just figure things out. Let the process happen. Give yourself time to recharge. If it\u2019s refuelling that we need to do, it\u2019s going to be hard to feel excited or inspired by anything we might engage with if we are, in fact, exhausted.\n\nWe should all know by now what the benefits of a proper sleep and rest are. We need down time and actual sleep for cognition, concentration and productivity. So start with actual sleep. Are you getting enough of it? Is it of a good quality?\n\nThen move on to the next stage: creative rest.\n\nThis means you are going to part your work in progress, any pressure being applied, and even your determination that things must be finished ASAP. It\u2019s time to start crocheting, painting, drawing, dancing, reading, singing, cooking, and any other damn thing you need that is not doing your writing. Rest your brain for a while. Let your characters take care of themselves in the background. They\u2019ll be fine.\n\nDo some combinatory play. In the words of Einstein, it is the \u201cact of opening up one mental channel by dabbling in another\u201d. Opening is what we want here \u2014 release, relaxation and ease. This is the antidote to stress, pressure, tightness, perfectionism, and emptiness.\n\nYou\u2019ll be on your way again, soon\n\nFinally, trust that you will refuel in time.\n\nAsk yourself: if I never published, or never had a reader, or never achieved what I wanted, would I have been happy, anyway, to be a writer? For me, the answer is yes. Even if nothing ever comes of it, I trust now that writing is a part of my life. Even if it all goes nowhere. I don\u2019t care about that, I just love to write.\n\nThat means I\u2019ll find a way to keep on doing it, even if I\u2019m empty, lost, whatever. I\u2019ll take a break, I\u2019ll ease back, I\u2019ll refuel, and I will, eventually, come back to the page.",

        "text": "People keep telling me \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult to be genuine\u201d. I think I know the reasons.\n\nLife is harsh, which is pretty clear.\n\nThe number of problems that we have to deal with keeps growing as we grow up. They are tuition fees, where to live, what to eat, how to support your family and beloved ones, how to have a car, how to get promoted, how to be a millionaire, and so on\u2026\n\nPeople believe that they have to adjust, change themselves, and live their lives with different faces in order to properly communicate with other people, to cope with many aspects of life, and to seize gold opportunities.\n\nThen they lose their own selves in the end.\n\nFor me, admitting that \u201cI lost myself already\u201d is positive to some extent because it means at least you know who you were, who you should be, and who the real you are.\n\nThat is, you are aware that how much you have changed, no matter what it is, good or bad, there is a little regret in your words, because it is always better to be yourself in every decision to get what you want, and also great to have everything in your life built by your true self.\n\nDo you know what is worst?\n\nYou let go of yourself to become another one.\n\nYou were born unique. Are you something special or outstanding? It doesn\u2019t matter, you are a unique one.\n\nEven though you resemble someone, your personality is similar to someone, or people cannot stop compare you with someone else, only you know what makes you different, and whether it is manifested or not depends on you.\n\nHowever, you choose to become another person, to make others believe that you are another one for what you\u2019re chasing.\n\nAnd then you are them, they are you, nothing different.\n\nDo you know why it is bad?\n\nBecause you chose to do it.\n\nEvery night, you lie down exhaustedly because being another one is not easy and all the emotions that you express are not for you, which just makes you stuck.\n\nPersonal desires and goals are the most precious things that need to be respected.\n\nIt is wonderful if you never stop striving for those things in your life, even you have to trade your ego for it, as long as you\u2019re happy with your choice.\n\nHowever, what will it be like if all your rush and your changes don\u2019t pay off? You fail to gain what you want.\n\nDoes that mean you lose everything including yourself? After all the failures, no one is beside you even your shadow.\n\nMany people out there are day in day out battling with their life, they wish they could be true to themselves once to make decisions, to follow what they\u2019re destined to be.\n\nIt\u2019s all about your choice.\n\nOnce you make your decision, you\u2019ll find ways to make it work.\n\nI choose to be genuine in everything I do. I think my life would be miserable if I didn\u2019t live authentically, and fight for my life philosophy.\n\nYou only live once, why don\u2019t you find ways to express the true you.\n\nI met people in my life accidentally. They just come and get to know me. They stay to be friends, and important ones of mine because of who I am.\n\nI have never chosen or forced anyone to stay with me or leave me, I just keep myself being sincere and genuine.\n\nThat\u2019s how I met great people and awesome friends.\n\nThat is also how I write; I\u2019d like to create content that expresses myself most honestly.\n\nIdeas come to me naturally, but sometimes I still get stuck in explaining myself and making them easy to understand.\n\nAt that time, I would close my eyes, focus deeply, and feel what I truly think about the topic, I then carefully select words that best demonstrate me, although they\u2019re not the finest.\n\nThere are definitely disadvantages to a lifestyle that always stays true with words and actions (please don\u2019t hurt other people by being yourself, it\u2019s another realm), but I believe that what I will achieve will be great and worth it because when these contents touch the heart of readers, they will stay.\n\nThey stay because they gradually get to know me, who has similarities and common feelings with them, and they\u2019d like to know more and pick up more valuable experiences from me.\n\nStay true to yourself, do things genuinely, make decisions, and live a life of who you are. This sounds dreamy but not delusional at all. Just think about it, if you can feel how great your life could be, why don\u2019t give it a go.\n\nChoosing to be yourself or become another person is not an easy choice, do what you think is worth it.",

        "title": "Your Genes May Determine Your Covid-19 Risk",
        "text": "In the early throes of the coronavirus pandemic, two brothers in the Netherlands fell sick with Covid-19. They were young \u2014 29 and 32 \u2014 and previously healthy. But both brothers developed severe symptoms and, at the end of March, were admitted to the intensive care unit. Within days, the older brother couldn\u2019t breathe on his own and needed ventilation. His younger brother came down with an unusually high fever and eventually died from complications of the disease.\n\nA physician took note of the cases and contacted Alexander Hoischen, PhD, a geneticist at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, who set out to investigate why these brothers were so unusually affected. Sure, it could have been a coincidence, but Hoischen thought it was also possible that the brothers shared a genetic trait that compromised their immune systems.\n\n\u201cIf you look at all the men hospitalized from Covid-19, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that that happens to such young individuals, and then it happened twice in the same family,\u201d Hoischen tells Elemental. \u201cThat was extremely remarkable to us.\u201d\n\nDays later, a second pair of brothers landed in separate Dutch hospitals. Both men, just 21 and 23 years old, also had difficulty breathing and were put on ventilators. CT scans revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had ravaged the younger brother\u2019s lungs. After more than a week in the hospital, both brothers were discharged. When Hoischen learned of the second pair of brothers, he was even more convinced that there was a genetic component to the young men\u2019s severe disease.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, it has become clear that certain factors \u2014 being elderly, male, obese, or a racial or ethnic minority \u2014 raise a person\u2019s risk of developing severe Covid-19 and dying from it. Having an underlying chronic condition like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure also significantly increases the likelihood of death. These factors can explain many cases of severe Covid-19 \u2014 but not all.\n\nWhat\u2019s so puzzling about the coronavirus is the wide spectrum of symptoms associated with it. Why do some people get a mild cough or no symptoms at all, while others go into respiratory failure? Why do many feel better within days, while others struggle to recover for weeks or months after infection? And why does a healthy person in his 20s succumb to a disease that spares the vast majority of people his age?\n\nA person\u2019s genetics could play a role. To learn more, scientists all over the world have been scanning huge genetic datasets, collecting DNA samples from Covid-19 patients, and analyzing their genomes in hopes of finding genetic signatures that explain why some people develop very serious symptoms.\n\nAcademic researchers and biotech companies have come together to form the Covid Human Genetic Effort and the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative, international consortiums that are pooling together data from thousands of patients in dozens of countries. Meanwhile, consumer genetics companies 23andMe and Ancestry are scouring DNA data from millions of customers to look for genetic links.\n\nThe results of these studies could help researchers develop new treatments or repurpose existing drugs to treat Covid-19 alongside other therapies. They could also lead to genetic tests that could predict someone\u2019s Covid-19 risk. Genetic traits that predispose a person to more serious symptoms could even guide vaccine distribution. People with these traits could be prioritized for a vaccine, when one becomes available.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented for people to have genetic differences that make them more or less susceptible to infection,\u201d Catherine Ball, PhD, chief scientific officer at Ancestry, tells Elemental.\n\n\u201cThere will most definitely be a genetic component associated with disease severity\u2026 However, the degree to which the impact is seen is yet to be determined.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most well-known genetic trait associated with immunity is the sickle cell trait, which is most common in people from Africa or those of African descent. Carriers of sickle cell disease \u2014 those who have one sickle cell gene and one normal gene \u2014 are protected from malaria infection. But people who inherit two copies of the sickled gene from each parent develop sickle cell disease, a chronic and painful blood condition.\n\nAnother genetic trait with an effect on immunity is a specific mutation in the CCR5 gene. This subtle genetic change provides protection against HIV by blocking the virus from entering immune cells. Only about 1% of northern Europeans carry two copies of the mutation; one copy does not prevent infection.\n\nResearchers have also identified single-gene mutations, known as inborn errors of immunity, that weaken the immune system. While some undermine the body\u2019s ability to fight all infections, others may affect a person\u2019s risk to a specific pathogen, like influenza or Epstein-Barr virus. Now, early research is revealing that a subset of people with severe Covid-19 harbor similar single-gene mutations that seem to have a big impact on the course of their disease. These mutations are likely rare in the general population. For others, a combination of several genetic variants and other risk factors, like preexisting conditions, may explain some extreme cases.\n\n\u201cThere will most definitely be a genetic component associated with disease severity,\u201d Joseph Petrosino, PhD, chair of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, tells Elemental. \u201cHowever, the degree to which the impact is seen is yet to be determined.\u201d",

Since it adds a great convenience of shopping, therefore, more and more people are making online purchases via mobile apps.\n\nHowever before you make a decision to build an eCommerce mobile app, it is worth to understand the commonly used convincing models of eCommerce apps, as mentioned below:\n\nBusiness To Business (B2B) mobile eCommerce apps are aiming to sell products and services to enterprises. The interactions are carried out between two companies with the help of mobile apps and generating a great opportunity for you to earn potential income through B2B applications.\n\nFor example: if you manufacture and want to promote your product or service range, then B2B apps can provide you with a platform to pitch the enterprises who are interested in your service.\n\nMoreover, the increasing demand for B2B apps is expected to drive the market to $140 billion by 2023 and 70% of all B2B queries are expected to be smartphones in 2020.\n\nBusiness To Customer (B2C) is one of the most popular types of app models as it helps in conducting interaction between certain companies (online stores like Amazon, eBay, Flipkart) and the end-customers who are willing to make final purchases. Moreover, most enterprises choose to go with this type of app model as it enables you to sell products and services directly to the end-customers, add a variety of products, and integrate limitless online stores on this portal.\n\nStats and Facts to Understand the Importance of Having Ecommerce Mobile Application\n\nBefore you decide which eCommerce mobile app model you need to proceed with, it is important to analyse the market to get the best ROI. In addition, being up-to-date with the current state of the e-commerce market is not just important for the online business owners, but also for the businesses which are still in-store based.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look over the current state of eCommerce statistics to understand how the world\u2019s commerce continues to move online at a steady rate.\n\nAccording to the report of Statista, the number of global digital buyers will jump from 1.32 billion to 2.14 Billion in 2021.\n\nAccording to the latest market report, the revenue of the eCommerce market is projected to reach $2,411,638m in 2020. And the number of users is expected to amount t0 4,658 million in the eCommerce market by 2024.\n\nWith the impact of a number of factors including cheaper smartphones, internet subscription plans, increasing spending power and more in between 2020 to 2024, Turkey, Argentina, Indonesia and India are expected to be top countries for highest retail eCommerce sales with the CAGR forecast of 20.2%, 16.3%, 15.4% and 13.1% respectively.\n\nAccording to the survey report, 95% of retail sales will take place online by 2040 and generate great value to the retail economy.\n\nIn The Nutshell: Hopefully, with these stats and facts you have understood the increasing demand for eCommerce mobile app development solutions in 2021. In addition, the above figures and survey reports are clearly portraying the declining popularity of bricks and mortar stores in contrast to online stores.\n\nSo, now let\u2019s assume that you are ready to hire a mobile app developer but still you might be scratching your head with the question of what you will get from the eCommerce Mobile application?\n\nLet\u2019s find the answer below\u2026\n\nWhat does Your Business Will get From the E-commerce Mobile App?\n\nIf you look at the market trends of the last few years, you will find an undeniable fact that mobile applications have brought a great change in the market. Gone are those days when people went to the local shops with the list of items in hand as mobile eCommerce apps have taken over those local stores by simply adding the comfort of ordering the products with one tap.\n\nApart from that, here are the reasons why you need to invest in eCommerce mobile app development?\n\n1. Mobile Apps Are The Preferred Choice of Shopping\n\nThere is no denying the fact that using mobile apps are far easier than browsing websites. Since everyone uses mobile phones these days which makes it very easy for the customers to access online shopping stores by simply downloading the eCommerce mobile app.\n\nIn fact, 75% of the apps are used once after being downloaded. The reason being users don\u2019t have to remember complicated URLs and log in every time they visit your site. Moreover, the speed of browsing applications is far faster than browsing eCommerce websites. The faster loading time of the apps always deliver a better user experience and leave your customer with a satisfying shopping experience.\n\n2. 24*7 Accessibility Can Improve Customer Engagement\n\nWith the increasing competition in every business domain, mobile applications can help you stay connected with your customers 24*7. And according to the studies, it is revealed that most consumers across the world spend 90% of their time on mobile phones and applications. So having your eCommerce mobile app will not just help you expand your business but also ensures your 24/7 availability to the customers which ultimately improves the engagement with your customers.\n\n3. Increase the Transparency of the Services\n\nGone are those days when websites were considered as the face of your brand. Nowadays, with the increasing usage of mobile applications, these apps have started to act as the presenting face of your business on the internet. The transparency provided by the eCommerce mobile application offers a great point of relief to the customers in many ways.\n\n4. Great Source Of Income\n\nNo matter what kind of mobile app model you choose to develop in 2021, mobile eCommerce apps can be a sole and additional source of income. Since eCommerce mobile applications provide a broad choice of products and services on a single tap, therefore customers find it far easier to make a purchase in your e-shop.\n\n5. Boost Customer Loyalty\n\nWhen a customer visits a website, they usually check the business details of the company. However, when a customer downloads your app, it means that a customer is already interested in your products and services. So all you need is to adopt the right loyalty program to turn your visitor into a potential customer. 64% of retailers say that their loyalty/rewards program is the best way to connect with consumers.\n\n6. Offering New Marketing Opportunities\n\nYou may provide world-class services and product lines, but what if it has no buyers? That\u2019s where a reputed mobile app development company can help you build a perfect estore that not only enables you to get connected with the new customers but also promotes your brand. In addition, careful monitoring and analyzing the traffic of your app, you can easily optimize the consumer\u2019s behaviour and be able to determine when they are less likely to buy your products.\n\n7. Building a Strong Relationship With Customers\n\nThis is something that is quite challenging to achieve with the website. Sure, you can keep your customers updated with the via email about your new products or seasonal sales, but that this channel lacks to build a strong connection with the users as a mobile app can build with the push notifications.\n\nPush notifications are both instant to access and keep reminding your brand to the users. In addition, such alerts work as a personal communicator between your brand and customers that automatically seeks the attention of the shoppers when they receive an app alert at the right time.\n\nIn the Nutshell: Undoubtedly, eCommerce mobile apps can help you expand your business to the next level and enable you to reach a wide range of customers.

Your presence on mobile apps will not only help you get connected with the users instantly but also allow you to identify new business opportunities and assist in expanding your business to the next level.\n\nI have concluded everything in this blog that helps you understand why you need an eCommerce mobile app and what features can make it successful and how much does it cost you to develop.

        "title": "Let go of these things for a happier 2021",
        "text": "by: E.B. Johnson\n\nWe are moving into another year, and with that comes the expectation of both change and improvement. That requires that we take some action, though, and make a mindful and concentrated effort to improve the things that held us back in 2020. Are you ready to make 2021 better than the last? Even as chaos continues to swirl, you can find happiness. You\u2019re going to have to let go of some bad habits first, though, and commit to your right to thrive.\n\nWe can\u2019t hold on if we want to move on.\n\nThis year was one that was filled with tension, chaos, and pain. As soon as we seemed to be on an upward trajectory, life often hurled us back down again. It was a challenging year and one that asked us to dig deep and re-discover the best of ourselves. Though we grew through this year, we look to the future with the expectation of smoother sailing and brighter shores. To get there, though, we need to let go of the negativity we adopted this year.\n\nWe can\u2019t hold on to 2020 if we want the year ahead to be better. We need to let go of our fear and stop following bad friends and toxic partners to the edge of our sanity and happiness. All of us were pushed to the brink this year. It\u2019s time to learn that there\u2019s no time like the present to make the most of what we have and what we want. Let go of the pain and let go of the hesitation. It\u2019s time to leap in the name of a future which is authentically yours.\n\nThe things you need to let go of in 2021.\n\nWe can\u2019t go into 2021 holding on to all the negativity that\u2019s been left in our hearts this year. It\u2019s time for us to take some personal responsibility and build lives that are authentic and sustainable, but that\u2019s first going to require us to let go of the toxic habits that held us down in 2020.\n\nBad friendships\n\nDid you waste a lot of time this year feeding into bad friendships? Consider your closest confidantes. When things went wrong this year, who was there for you? Who expected you to be there for them? Did you spend a lot of time on the phone, listening to everyone else\u2019s problems (while no one asked you about your own)? This new year is a great time to stop feeding friendships that don\u2019t feed your soul\n\nHeartless employers\n\nWe have all spent so much of our lives contributing to the wealth of heartless employers that continue to hurt us and the planet. It\u2019s time for us to start making plans which allow us to each create our own wealth in 2021. Want to start a business? Have a great idea for an app? It\u2019s time to go for it. Likewise, look for better ways to meet your needs by using brands which are kinder to the environment and more equitable with their employees. Shop local and black-made. Skip out on the big names (except where necessary).\n\nClout chasing\n\nOur society has become one that is obsessed with clout. It\u2019s arguable that we\u2019ve undone the very fabric of our own society, chasing \u201clikes\u201d and edgy posts on social media. In 2021, we need to focus on putting down the phone. We need to stop chasing likes on social media. It\u2019s time to spend more time in the real world, and it\u2019s time to fall in love with the real you (or become someone you can fall in love with).\n\nPressing refresh\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic and the turbulence of the American political cycle, this year had us glued to the news like never before. That\u2019s not always a good thing, though. For the new year, we need to put the endless news cycles, political scandals, and the force-fed tickers on pause. They\u2019re putting you on edge and they are detaching you from your humanity. Instead of feeding their fear, we have to get our hands dirty, get involved with our local communities, and get things fixed ourselves.\n\nToxic relationships\n\nToxic relationships have no place in our futures; especially not if we intend on being happy, fulfilled, and whole. No matter who the toxic person in your life might be, you need to shed them from your life if you truly intend on building a life that is centered around your joy. A life lived on our own terms is a powerful thing, and it can be ours in 2921. We first have to make room for fulfilling relationships and experiences, though.\n\nFear following\n\nThis year was a scary one. From lockdowns to full-on riots, change was the theme of the year, and in that change was a lot of soul-shattering fear. While the year ahead doesn\u2019t necessarily look more peaceful, we still have to find ways to rid ourselves of our fear. This fear holds us back, keeps us small, and prevents us from standing up for the future we\u2019re trying to build. Improving our lives requires that we stop letting fear be the primary motivation and dictator of your life.\n\nSelf-loathing\n\nIn the western world, we\u2019re generally taught that we\u2019re never quite good enough. We\u2019re taught to loathe ourselves, and that gets reinforced through marketing messages and negative internal narratives that prevent us from building fulfilling lives. Holding on to all this self-loathing is getting us nowhere but broke and unhappy. It\u2019s time to love who we are and embrace our right to a happier, more self-determined 2021.\n\nHow to do it.\n\nTelling yourself you\u2019ll get rid of these negative factors is one thing, doing it is another. Our lives don\u2019t change if we don\u2019t take action. If you\u2019re really serious about making next year better than the last, then reconnect with your sense of self and commit to living in line with every aspect of your truth.\n\n1. Enhance your sense of self\n\nWe all got a little lost this year, and we all found ourselves questioning who we are and what we want. If we had time for anything, it was reflection \u2014 and that\u2019s a powerful thing at any stage in life. As the new year looms ahead, it looks like we\u2019re going to get even more time to sit and think about who we really are. Now is the time to enhance your sense of self and get back to the core of your future aims and joy.\n\nReconnect with who you are on both a physical and emotional level. Who are you to the world? Who do you consider yourself to be right now in this moment? While we are always changing, we should also be seeking to become a better version of ourselves. Who do you want to be in 10 or 20 years? How do you want to feel about yourself?\n\nRebuild your self-confidence. You have to believe in yourself if you\u2019re going to make changes in your life, and you have to believe in your right to thrive. Fall in love with whom you are and commit to creating a life that is both fulfilling and rewarding in whatever arena you decide to build it in. The more you believe in yourself, the easier it will become to adapt to the challenges life throws your way. The more you believe in yourself, the easier it will be to embrace change.\n\n2. Figure out your authenticity\n\nAuthenticity is everything when it comes to building a life that is both joyful and fulfilling. We can find our happiness in someone else\u2019s definition of what success looks like. We alone know what it takes to fill that sense of longing within us. We know what our happiness looks like, and we know what it wears. Instead of chasing everyone else\u2019s expectations of us, we need to use 2021 to pursue our own hopes of life.\n\nWho do you want to be? When you look back over your life, how do you want to remember yourself and the life you built? By the time it comes to the final finish line, you will be the only one standing there looking back over everything that was and the decisions that you made.\n\nFigure out who you are and stand beside that person proudly in the new year. One of the most important lessons we could walk away with after 2020 it is that life can change in an instant. Stop waiting for someone else\u2019s happiness and get serious about living in line with your own. Pinpoint your morals, your values, and everything that you want your life and your relationships to be. The time for the real you to thrive is now.\n\n3. Build a support system\n\nAs humans, we are social creatures and we thrive on the deep and lasting connections which we make with others. It means a lot to have someone to talk to; someone who makes you laugh, or is able to improve your mood or belief in self. Support systems matter, and they can be invaluable when it comes to improving our lives throughout 2021.\n\nCultivate more loving, supportive friendships for yourself. Create a network of strong, confident individuals that you can rely on for trustworthy advice and compassionate care when things get challenging. Look for people who want the best for you and look for those who see you for who you really are.\n\nYour life is within the realm of your control, and it comes with a limited amount of space in it. Rather that filling that space with people who hurt you and take advantage, fill that space with light and love. Put up walls between the toxic and build bridges between those people with whom you really connect on deeper, truly meaningful levels.\n\n4. Invest in yourself\n\nThere will be a lot of people reading this who think things to themselves like, \u201cHow could I possibly create something that\u2019s mine? How could I possibly learn to change my own life?\u201d It all comes down to embracing your humanity and the core of what you are. We are all capable of learning, and we all have talents to offer the world. We have to invest in ourselves to learn and uncover these skills, though.\n\nThis year, make an investment in bettering yourself across the board. Boost your education through online classes. Find something that interests you and get a certification in it. Enhance your knowledge and unlock new avenues of opportunity for yourself.\n\nRe-engage with your passions. Find new hobbies that allow you to connect with your joy. Look for new interests which drive you to discover more of the world and more of yourself. The more you invest in yourself, the more the world will want to invest in you. Once you know what you are worth, there\u2019s almost no right door that won\u2019t open to you.\n\n5. Stop settling for unhappiness\n\nAt some point, we have to make the decision to create the life we want. We can keep listening to all the surrounding negativity, or we can decide to take action and go for it. Are you ready to stop settling for unhappiness? Are you ready to manifest the future that was always yours to begin with? The new year is a clean slate, and what better time could there be to seek self-determination?\n\nUnderstand that life doesn\u2019t always go the way you want it to. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find happiness in it. Commit to seeing the silver lining in life. Commit to finding your joy even in the midst of uncertainty and change. This year taught us a lot of lessons, but it certainly taught us the beauty in the simple moments.\n\nYou can keep fighting against the chaos of the world, or you can accept it and incorporate it into your plan. How are you going to change the way you see things in 2021? Our emotions are within our control. We choose how we want to respond and how we want to react to any given situation. Are you going to remain afraid and unsettled? Or are you going to reach for your joy no matter what comes next? The choice is yours and yours alone.\n\nPutting it all together\u2026\n\nWe are coming to the end of another year and looking ahead (perhaps more than usual) to the start of a new year. 2021 seems filled with possibility, and it is. In order to take advantage of those opportunities, though, we\u2019re going to have to shed the negative things that held us back in 2020 and get committed to making a life we value and adore.\n\nEnhance your sense of self and find effective ways to rebuild your self-esteem. The more you believe in yourself, the easier it will be to stand up for your boundaries and the things you want in this life. Figure out your authenticity and build a life that aligns with your values and your morals. Build a support system you can rely on and fill it with people you can trust; people who want the best of you and who see the best in you. Invest in yourself. Want to start a business or take charge of your life? Learn how to do it and make a bet on your ability to thrive. Stop settling for unhappiness and commit to making 2021 a better year than 2020 ever was.",

        "title": "Not Everyone Will like Your Writing",
        "text": "Not Everyone Will like Your Writing\n\nAnd some of your Medium stories will flop. And some people will make more money than you. And life is unfair. Learn to live with it.\n\nI\u2019ve been writing on Medium for 8 months, and I feel like it\u2019s a privilege to have gained an audience, and an honor to be able to say I have regular readers. I\u2019m grateful for every view, for every clap, but whenever I see the same readers popping up on my notifications over and over again, I\u2019m especially touched.\n\nThat said, I know not everyone likes my stories, and I know not every one of my stories is a hit. Sometimes, readers jump to the response section to tell me how much they think I suck, and sometimes, my stories will \u201cdie\u201d at 25 claps.\n\nYes, I have over three thousand followers, I regularly contribute to one of Medium\u2019s largest publications, I get curated fairly often (a little over half of my stories published in May were curated), but some of my stories still struggle to reach 10 fans.\n\nLet\u2019s break down these two \u201cissues,\u201d shall we?\n\nThe impossibility of being universally liked is a lesson from kindergarten. From the moment that first kid pushes you on the playground, or that clique won\u2019t let you be a part of their little gang, or that girl won\u2019t let you sit next to her during recess, you learn: not everyone will like you. And if your teacher is a good teacher, and your parents are good parents, they will teach you that not everyone has to like you, and you have to learn to live with it.\n\n(These days, I think they just put the kids together and force them to get along, but in my time, we were still allowed to have personal preferences as to whom we considered our friends, and were taught to stand up to bullies ourselves, but I digress.)\n\nThe fact is that not even Harry Potter is universally liked (let\u2019s give Jesus a break), so how can I expect to be?\n\nThat\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t bother me when I receive comments from people who dislike my writing. If nothing else, it helps me with that whole thick skin situation everyone keeps saying writers should have.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWhen I joined the Medium Partner Program, my rationale was: \u201clet\u2019s see if I can make $50 bucks in a month. And if it doesn\u2019t pay off in a month or two, I\u2019ll move on to the next thing.\u201d\n\nI started posting almost every day (20 stories in the first month), and I was very fortunate to have one of them go viral, with 60K views and over one thousand fans up until today. Let\u2019s just say I got considerably more than \u201cjust $50 bucks\u201d that first month, and I haven\u2019t yet found a reason to quit Medium.\n\nI may not have found a reason to quit the platform, but I have had plenty of reasons to worry about Medium\u2019s future as a whole, and my future as a small part of its ecosystem.\n\nI\u2019ve gone two weeks without having a single story curated, despite posting something new every day. I\u2019ve watched my daily views drop from 2.5K to 1.5K and wondered how they could continue to go down despite the fact that I kept posting daily, and if that meant it was the end for me.\n\nAfter having a story go viral and reach over one thousand fans (see above), I had to see many stories flop, including one that flopped so hard it got exactly ONE fan:\n\nTo this day, I have 56 stories with less than 10 fans, and 47 stories with over 100 fans. When I look at stories with over 200 fans, that number drops to 26.\n\nI\u2019ve been posting on Medium for 8 months, I wrote over 200 stories in that time, and only 26 of them have 200 fans or more.\n\nAll other stories are somewhere in between, but more than half of my stories have less than 50 fans.\n\nMore than half.\n\nThat to me means only one thing: I can\u2019t count on success. All I can do is try my best, knowing full well I\u2019ll have to see a lot of stories flop so that a few can succeed.\n\nIt\u2019s like they say in economics, \u201cpast performance is no guarantee of future results.\u201d\n\nUntil April, my curation rate had been at around 30%. In April, I saw that number drop to 26% \u2014 that was when I had my 2 week curation \u201cdrought.\u201d\n\nI could have raged against the algorithm, against the curators, against other writers who were posting viral content that was overshadowing mine. I could have complained I was being censored. I could be jealous of how much other writers were making and suggested Medium capped earnings at some arbitrary number I pulled out of a hat.\n\nI didn\u2019t do any of that.\n\nIt turns out I understand the kindergarten lesson that not everyone has to like me and what I do.\n\nIt turns out seeing other writers make more money than I make inspires me to try to get there someday. I don\u2019t believe they need to fail, or be capped, so that I can succeed.\n\nIt turns out I understand the \u201cpast performance is no guarantee of future results\u201d principle, and that every day on Medium is a new day. A new day to write and share stories about things that matter to me, to earn what\u2019s mine, day after day, not to feel entitled to some result or another just because.\n\nInstead of raging against the platform, I went back to the drawing board. I asked myself, \u201cwhat am I doing wrong? How can I do better?\u201d\n\nMy strategy had always been to write honestly about what I care about, and that hadn\u2019t changed. I realized, however, that I had been trying to post too often, which sometimes caused my writing to feel more forced than natural. I actually had better results when I posted less, which meant I should write only when I felt I was most inspired.\n\nIn May, the adjustments I made to my writing process paid off, and my curation rate shot up to 51%. As for earnings, I earned in May only U$100 less than in April. Considering May was a 4 week pay period and April had been a 5 week pay period, I saw that as a huge victory for me.\n\nThe answer to getting distributed and to earn, it turned out, was in my hands all along.\n\nI\u2019m very happy with what I have accomplished on Medium, and I don\u2019t plan to stop posting here anytime soon, but I\u2019m ready to leave if it ever becomes unsustainable, or not worth my time. As I have adapted to Medium before, I\u2019m ready to adapt out of Medium if necessary.\n\nI see success on Medium as something I have to earn every day, with every new story, not as something I get comfortable with and take as a given. I\u2019ve said it three times by now, but I\u2019ll say it one more time, louder for those sitting in the back: \u201cpast performance is no guarantee of future results.\u201d\n\nEvery time I publish a story, I have high hopes for how far it might go, but I don\u2019t know how far it will go. I can\u2019t know. All I can do is hope.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned on Medium is that there\u2019s no use in raging against the system. Every second I spend angry that someone else\u2019s garbage post was curated while one of my babies is being ignored is one second I\u2019m not using to write the next post that might go viral. Every time I think it\u2019s unfair that another writer is making more money than I\u2019m making, I\u2019m jeopardizing my own future earnings. If I ever get to the same level, will I still cry \u201cunfair?\u201d I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI\u2019d rather put my head down and work than try to frame everything that\u2019s not going my way as \u201cunfair.\u201d\n\nAnd I strongly advise you to do the same.",

        "title": "Is Technology Neutral?",
        "text": "Technology is all around us. It is at once so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, and in other areas so remarkable as to grab the world\u2019s attention.\n\nFrom ceramic cups to nuclear weapons; from the springs in your mattress to immersive virtual worlds; from paper and pencils to intelligent algorithms\u2014technology runs the gamut from background noise to something like magic.\n\nBut even the background technologies were once like magic. Cups and springs might not make for much conversation today, but life would be profoundly different were they were never invented. Perhaps AI, virtual reality, and other developing technologies will follow a similar path.\n\nOne philosophical conundrum at the heart of these developments is the question of moral value: Can we say that a technology is good or bad, or are they neutral? Are our values embedded in the technologies we build or are they valueless until someone decides what to do with them?\n\nIt might seem trivial, but the answer to the question will impact how we regulate technology and who is responsible for the consequences of how it\u2019s used. As we blaze forward into the realms of intelligent computers, brain interfaces, and biohacking, the significance of these moral questions grows.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the arguments.\n\nGuns Don\u2019t Kill People, People Kill People\n\nA significant argument in favour of technologies being neutral is the Value Neutrality Thesis\u2014no moral valence can be ascribed to a technology, it is only when someone uses that technology that any value can be found.\n\nHere are the main points:\n\n1. Values Are Hard to Detect\n\nJoseph Pitt, in his article \u201cGuns Don\u2019t Kill, People Kill,\u201d argues that for technologies to contain or embody values, those values should be identifiable, but this is rarely the case.\n\nHe uses the example of a university football stadium. It might be a source of prestige or pride, a symbol of everything good about the university, it might represent the dreams and aspirations of the students. But all of those values are values of the people, not the stadium itself.\n\n\u201cThey may see the stadium as symbolizing their own values, but that doesn\u2019t mean the values are in the stadium.\u201d\n\nConsider how an alien would look at a knife they found floating in space\u2014would they identify the same values as us? Would they find any values at all? How should they even begin to look for them?\n\nHow about a member of a small tribe in the Amazon jungle who comes across an iPad\u2014what would they see in it? Would they ascribe the same value to it as a programmer in silicon valley?\n\n2. Different People, Different Values\n\nTools only have value when they are possessed by a creature with values, and so are dependant on the value system of that individual. In this system, if the person or context changes, the values also change.\n\nIf a student who plays football at the stadium suffers a devastating leg injury which ruins their future prospects, the value they ascribe to the stadium could take a dark turn, despite no physical alteration to the stadium or any change in the values of other students.\n\nWhen a new technology is introduced to a population, though it might have been developed for a specific purpose, its value is dependant on the function and purpose that each individual discovers.\n\nIf the value of our tools is dependant on the system they\u2019re in and the minds which interpret them, how can we say the tools have any values embedded in them? Shouldn\u2019t those values remain consistent?\n\n3. Value Depends on Use\n\nIt is the outcomes, consequences, and results of our actions that are open to valuation, not the tools which we might rely on.\n\nA knife is just a knife, a neutral object, it is not until someone uses it to peel a fruit or stab someone in the back that any moral value can be applied.\n\nThis argument focuses on the perspective of the end-users. Their desires, needs, and goals determine how the tech is used, which determines its value.\n\nThis perspective also suggests the end-users are responsible for the ethical use of technology. We can\u2019t blame guns for shooting people, even if they make it easier. Guns are neutral, people aren\u2019t.\n\nTo summarise:\n\nTechnology is a tool \u2014 we use tools, tools don\u2019t use us. We ascribe our own meaning to technologies, irrespective of the reasons for their existence. We are in control, we are free to use our tools how we want to, it is our choice. And for those who make poor choices, they are responsible for their actions.\n\nNow the counter-argument:\n\nWhen All You Have Is A Hammer, Everything Looks like A Nail\n\n\u201cI call it the law of the instrument, and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding.\u201d \u2014 Abraham Kaplan\n\nArguing against the value neutrality thesis are those who believe that our values and assumptions are baked into everything we design and build.\n\nRather than focusing on the freedom people have in how they interpret and use the tools, this perspective looks more closely at the designers and the designs, how the features of those designs influence people, and why our ability to identify the values isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nHere are the arguments:\n\n1. Technology is Intentional\n\nUnlike the somewhat haphazard selection processes seen in evolution, technology is willingly and consciously fashioned. It is conceptualised and considered before ever becoming a thing. Each new creation is built to satisfy a need, fulfil a purpose, to be useful.\n\nIt is our values which determine the technology \u2014 and the values the designers expect are held by their future users. While the users\u2019 actual values will determine how the tech is used, the fact the technology only exists because of our values makes them inseparable.\n\n2. Decisions Reveal Values\n\nEvery decision and selection process will reveal our values. Whenever we pick a default option or display some information over other information, we have made a value judgement. It is impossible to display everything equally, therefore there is always bias (what does this say about how I ordered this article?).\n\nMaking the buy now button more predominant, writing the terms and conditions in obtuse language, using red over blue in your brand identity, are all decisions that reflect values. But just because they reflect values, doesn\u2019t mean people will identify or share those values.\n\n3. Not All Values Are Seen\n\nSometimes the values are very explicit \u2014 such as labelling a product as \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d or \u201cparental advisory recommended.\u201d Whether you use the passcode feature on your phone, it is clearly designed for security. Why your remote control has an EPG button might be lost on you, but there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s there, and the reason reflects the values of the designers (or what the designer expects are the values of the users).\n\nWhether people can identify the values or not, doesn\u2019t mean the values aren\u2019t there. Consider for a moment the reverse of an alien finding a knife out in space \u2014 imagine that we found an alien device floating in space, something that was clearly designed and not random space debris resulting from natural processes. Beyond wanting to know who built it, surely we would be very interested in what it is and what it\u2019s for.\n\nWhile it will be an incredibly difficult task to find the purpose given we can\u2019t comprehend the mind that designed them, the technology must have been designed for a reason, and that reason would suggest values.\n\n4. Limited Range of Use\n\nTechnology is directional \u2014 it adds choices or improves processes which point in a certain direction.\n\nThere might be many different uses for guns \u2014 we could use them as paperweights or doorstops \u2014 but most of us know this is not the reason we have them. Guns were developed for a specific purpose, and we generally use them in accordance with that.\n\nThe range of possible uses is not infinite \u2014 we can\u2019t use one to drive down the road or watch a movie. Other uses are possible though not ideal \u2014 perhaps you can cut an onion but a knife would be better.\n\nThe limited range of ideal uses suggests where the inventor\u2019s values lie \u2014 a gun is great at killing or putting holes in things. If you need to puncture something from a distance, you pick the gun before you pick the doorstop \u2014 unless your doorstop is a gun.\n\n5. Eventually Frames Reality\n\n\u201cWe become what we behold. We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.\u201d \u2014 Marshall McLuhan\n\nThe longer a technology has been around, and the more widespread it is, the less it will be thought about and the more likely it will blend into the background, to become the norm we refer to when we talk about how things are.\n\nWhen we get too used to how things are, it takes greater effort to see how things could be different. When we get too used to what something does, it takes a more creative mind to see it in any other way.\n\nHere are two lines of research relevant to this argument:\n\nFunctional fixedness, which highlights the struggle of finding uses for objects outside of the way they\u2019re traditionally used. And the Einstellung effect, which describes the process of learning how to solve a problem using one method, but then failing to realise when a better method is available.\n\nIn each case, we get stuck in a particular thinking pattern or frame of mind. We go through the effort of learning, and then what we learned becomes automatic and rigid. This is not to say we cannot think creatively and break free from those patterns, but as tools and their uses become more common and familiar, it gets more difficult to see them any differently.\n\nTo summarise:\n\nTechnologies are developed by people for people. Our values determine what is created and how it is used, and its use is at least influenced by its design, if not fully dependant on it. While people can use tech creatively beyond its original purpose, there is a narrow band of possible functions which suggests the original purpose and therefore the values. As time passes and familiarity grows, the technology and it\u2019s function become so ingrained to be barely thought about, let alone questioned.\n\nThe Burden of Responsibility\n\nWe are not helpless slaves to technology, we are decision-makers and we value our freedom of choice. However, people often make poor decisions while being unaware of what factors influence them.\n\nWhile each individual can and does decide how they want to use certain technologies, on a collective level technology nudges us in directions that are not value-neutral.\n\nIf we call technologies neutral, we are relinquishing the creators of any blame in how those technologies alter the world. But then we need to ask if any company or individual should be praised for their inventions. How could designers be worthy of praise but not of guilt? And if we are to say that they are free of both, it is worth asking what role they have.\n\nIn 1986, Robert J. Welchel wrote in IEEE Technology and Society Magazine:\n\n\u201cThis moral neutrality is based upon viewing technology purely as a means (providing tools for society to use) with the ends (the actual usage of technology) lying beyond and outside the realm of engineering; this position also assumes that available means have no causal influence on the ends chosen. If technology truly is only a means, then engineering is a second-class profession since we are the mere pawns of the real power brokers. We buy our innocence at a tremendous cost: To be innocent, we must be powerless.\u201d\n\nDeciding that creators are culpable and that technologies are embedded with values doesn\u2019t make it any easier to figure out what technologies embody good values. For that we have to collectively agree on what values are good and set a standard for what we consider a violation of those values, then we can decide how to respond to those violations.\n\nA significant roadblock here is our inability to predict the future. If no designer, inventor, or company is capable of predicting all of the future benefits and costs of what they build, how can they possibly ensure they embed good values?\n\nBut this is an old philosophical problem \u2014 if we can never predict all the consequences of our actions, how can we tell the good from the bad in any domain? This problem does not stop us from making ethical choices in other areas of life, why should it stop us here?\n\nWe must find the best explanations or predictions we can, using the information we have. If we pay attention to how different technologies progress, and particularly to their consequences, we can learn from our mistakes and make better decisions.\n\nOur current way of life is so closely intertwined with technology they could be considered one and the same. It seems absurd to think we can go backwards and untangle much of it, but we can be more careful in how we weave future technologies into our lives.\n\nThis is important, as future technologies are likely much more powerful and consequential than today\u2019s. When intelligent machines make their own ethical choices, it will make no sense to say that technology is neutral, and it will make it tremendously important to align our values.",

Since this seasonal change is natural, our age-old Ayurvedic and Naturopathic systems of healing health state that eating foods like garlic, onion, meat, grains and eggs etc. continuously at all times make us prone to catching all kinds of energies. Energies that are not good, not just from the surroundings but even by absorbing those very energies that were present in what we ate. They say that at times, especially during season change since our body\u2019s immunities always lie low and when we eat high-energy foods, we make ourselves susceptible to catching seasonal diseases. So how do we treat this problem?\n\nDid you know that everybody \u2013 every single person \u2013 requires purification a minimum of twice a year to maintain a perfectly healthy body balance. So I feel that because of this concept, came up the Navratri fasting so that we could cleanse our systems.\n\nCredits \u2014 Credits \u2014 Image from iPhone Geetika Sethi\n\nThe Navratri Special \u2013 Part 2\n\nSo basically, the scientific logic behind these fasts and the main reason is to enable the person to benefit from Detoxification, Mindfulness and Self Control.\n\nDuring the Detoxification phase as we give up certain foods for 9 days, our bodies start to detoxify. We cleanse our system and lighten ourselves by eating easily digestible foods like fruits which clean our digestive system and vegetables that build it. In this way, we prepare our digestive and immune system for the upcoming season.\n\nSo those who fast are doing the perfect thing by taking care of themselves as it\u2019s only during fasting that our internal organs get rest and thus start to heal and recover from their daily work stress. But for those who can\u2019t fast, do yourself a favour by trying to not eat any heavy foods which you feel slow your digestion or cause you to discomfort like meat, eggs, chicken, spices, grains etc for these 9 days to give your system a part-time break.\n\nNow coming to Mindfulness, which is a wonderful thing and enables you to think clearly while putting your mind at ease. Fasting twice a year lightens your entire system, keeps your mind fresh and doesn\u2019t allow you to develop brain fog. This happens because during fasting when your digestive system is at rest, your mind works at a faster speed from the fresh and positive energies it gets from all your intakes \u2013 physical, mental as well as spiritual \u2013 giving you clarity of thought.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s all about Self-Control which is indeed the gut of fasting. This is the toughest because when you try to stop yourself from eating what you are accustomed to, you are trying to break an ongoing pattern that you\u2019ve been following all through. And if you can succeed at this, you can succeed anyhow because by doing this you will develop an amazing discipline that leads to strengthening your will power and building solid self-control, making you the true ruler of your mind.\n\nSo this Navratri, let\u2019s all do this Purification Feasting Fast.\n\nCredits \u2014 Credits \u2014 Image from iPhone Geetika Sethi\n\nThe Navratri Special \u2014 Part3\n\nDo you wish to Celebrate the upcoming pious days of Navratri eating the yummiest foods and feasting to your fullest?\n\nDo you wish to feel fit by cleansing your body and mind?\n\nAre you ready to shed your weight \u2013 off your mind and body?\n\nWell, you got confused and read the last one again, thinking you read it wrong? Not to worry, as you didn\u2019t read it incorrectly and nor did I write it that way because \u2026..
